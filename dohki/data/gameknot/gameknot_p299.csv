0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',1. d4 is the second most popular opening choice for white.  It occupies one center square and attacks another (e5).  It opens a line for the bishop on c1 and offers a slight boost to the queen's mobility.  The d2 square is now an option for the knight on b1 as well.  There is a slight weakening of the e4 and c4 squares because the d-pawn can never be used to help control them.
1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A flexible move.  It is a centralizing developing move that doesn't tip black's hand.  The knight is almost certainly going to move to f6 anyway so why not right away?  The knight attacks two center squares (e4 d5).  Since white slightly weakened e4 with 1. d4 black will want to think seriously about fighting for this square.
2,0,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',A natural follow-up to 1. d4. White is using the c-pawn to contest the d5 square.  Experience has shown that white's best hope to secure the initiative is to play the c-pawn to c4 prior to developing the knight to c3.  If white chooses not to use the c-pawn in the fight for the center spatial equality is the most likely outcome.  In this game white wants more.
3,0,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"The Nimzo-Indian.  Named after the great theorist Aaron Nimzowitsch this opening is based on a deep understanding of pawn structure.  Nimzowitsch's writing on pawn structure (first ""Blockade"" and then ""My System"") educated generations of chess players and it now belongs to our common chess heritage."
4,0,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is obviously where the knight belongs.  It centralizes the knight (moves it towards the center) which usually increases the piece's power.  Pieces tend to be more mobile in the center of the board and their power is tied to their mobility.  The knight is also helping to fight for the control of the e4 and d5 squares.
5,0,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The key move of the Nimzo.  Black is willing to trade his king bishop for white's queen knight which is counter to classic chess theory.  What Nimzovitsch had in mind was to double white's c-pawns then blockade them (prevent their advance) and then attack them.  This is a very deep strategical plan and we're only on the third move!
6,0,6,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',There are many continuations but 4. Qc2 is one of the most popular.  White wishes to be able to recapture on c3 with a piece preserving the pawn structure and thwarting black's plan.
7,0,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',The white queen is protecting c3 now but has abandoned the protection of the pawn on d4.  Black takes advantage of this by making a developing move that includes a threat.  White must take time to defend the d-pawn.
8,0,8,e3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',5. Nf3 is also possible.  5. e3 defends the d-pawn and opens a line for the bishop on f1 but notice what it does to the mobility of the bishop on c1.  Chess is about making choices and trade-offs.
9,0,9,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',Black has quickly completed his kingside development and castled.  With the king safely secured behind a phalanx of pawns on the side of the board black can initiate action in the center.
10,0,10,Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PPQB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQ -',Because white has established a pawn chain on dark squares (f2 e3 d4) this is the weaker of the two bishops.  White would be happy to exchange it.  Notice however that white's kingside development has been neglected.
11,0,11,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PPQB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Black intends to part with his dark square bishop.  His strategy now is to play d6 and e5.  He will use his pawns to fight for the dark squares and his c1 bishop to help fight for the light ones.
12,0,12,Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PPQB1PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',The bishop belongs on this diagonal (b1-h7).  It is posted as aggressively as possible.
13,0,13,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PPQB1PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',Consistent with the plan of playing e6-e5.  The queen gets off of the back rank and asssists the e-pawn's advance.
14,0,14,Nf3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',8. Nge2 was also possible allowing the f-pawn to be used in the fight for control of the center.
15,0,15,e5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/4p3/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black advances with a threat.  If white castles for example black would capture on c3 and then advance the e-pawn to e4 forking two of white's pieces.
16,0,16,Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/3Np3/1bPP4/3BPN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Intiating tactics in the center which is dangerous if you haven't castled.
17,0,17,Nxd5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np4/3np3/1bPP4/3BPN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',9. ...Bxd2  was also possible.
18,0,18,1Bxh7+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppB/2np4/3np3/1bPP4/4PN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I was expecting 10. cxd5 Bxd2  
19,0,19,1Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1qppB/2np4/3np3/1bPP4/4PN2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Forced.
20,0,20,Bxd2+,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1qppB/2np4/3Pp3/3P4/4PN2/PPQb1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Also forced.
21,0,21,1Nxd2,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1qppB/2np4/3Pp3/3P4/4P3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',12. Qxd2 would've been better but black has 12. ...Nxd4 with a slight advantage.
22,0,22,1Nb4,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1qppB/3p4/3Pp3/1n1P4/4P3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',White cannot save the bishop without losing something.  13. Qb1 exd4 is better for black.
23,0,23,1Qe4,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1qppB/3p4/3Pp3/1n1PQ3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This is a mistake.  White has to abandon the bishop on h7 with 13. Qb3 but again black can play 13. ...exd4 with the better game.
24,0,24,1f5,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1q1pB/3p4/3Ppp2/1n1PQ3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R w KQ f6',Now the bishop is lost without compensation.  White may have over looked that the black queen controls the h4 square so the white queen is forced to retreat.
25,0,25,1Qb1,b'r1b2r1k/ppp1q1pB/3p4/3Ppp2/1n1P4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/RQ2K2R b KQ -',If 14. Bxf5 Bxf5 followed by 15. ...Nc2  winning.
26,0,26,1Kxh7,b'r1b2r2/ppp1q1pk/3p4/3Ppp2/1n1P4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/RQ2K2R w KQ -',Establishing material superiority.
27,0,27,Nxd5,b'r1b2r2/ppp1q1pk/3p4/3n1p2/3P4/8/PP1N1PPP/RQ3RK1 w - -',The captures are over and black is a piece ahead.
28,0,28,1Qd3,b'r1b2r2/ppp1q1pk/3p4/3n1p2/3P4/3Q4/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',First 17. Re1 taking over the e-file would've been a bit better.
29,0,29,1Qg5,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/3p4/3n1pq1/3P4/3Q4/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Transferring the queen to the kingside and threatening 18. ...Nf4.
30,0,30,1Qh3+,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/3p4/3n1pq1/3P4/7Q/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',18. Nf3 was better because white needs to avoid a further reduction in material.  When ahead in pieces each piece exchange (of equal value) increases your winning chances.  This is termed simplification in chess.  (It is easier to convert a 6-3 material advantage than one of 15-12 even though you are  3 in both cases.)
31,0,31,1Nf3,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/3p3q/3n1p2/3P4/5N1Q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White's best chance was probably to go back to d3 with the queen.
32,0,32,1Qxh3,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/3p4/3n1p2/3P4/5N1q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Once the queens come off the board black's material advantage is even more pronounced.
33,0,33,2Ng5+,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/3p4/3n1pN1/3P4/7q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Temporarily preserving the integrity of his kingside pawn structure.
34,0,34,2Nxh3,b'r1b2r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3n1p2/3P4/7N/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The knight however has nowhere to go now.
35,0,35,2f4,b'r1b2r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3n4/3P1p2/7N/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So black attacks it.  White's kingside pawn structure will be ruined no matter what.
36,0,36,2a3,b'r1b2r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3n4/3P1p2/P6N/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Moving a rook to the e-file would've been a more active plan.
37,0,37,f3,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3n4/3P4/P4p1P/1P3P1P/R4RK1 w - -',Clearing the f4 square for the knight and sealing in the white king.
38,0,38,2Rae1,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3n4/3P4/P4p1P/1P3P1P/4RRK1 b - -',A little too little too late.
39,0,39,2Nf4,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/8/3P1n2/P4p1P/1P3P1P/4RRK1 w - -',White's doubled h-pawn's provide scant shelter for the king.
40,0,40,2h4,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/8/3P1n1P/P4p2/1P3P1P/4RRK1 b - -',The last chance was 25. Re7 but black's plan would've been the same.
41,0,41,2Ne2+,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/8/3P3P/P4p2/1P2nP1P/4RRK1 w - -',The knight and f-pawn combine to trap the king on the h-file.
42,0,42,2Kh1,b'r4r2/ppp3p1/3p2k1/8/3P3P/P4p2/1P2nP1P/4RR1K b - -',Notice the mating pattern.  If white's h-pawns were removed Rh8 would be mate.  So black goes after the h-pawns.
43,0,43,2d5,b'r7/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3P4/5r1P/P4p2/1P2nP1P/4RR1K b - -',Preserving a pawn that black had no interest in.
44,0,44,2Rxh4,b'r7/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3P4/7r/P4p2/1P2nP1P/4RR1K w - -',The threat is now mate in two.
45,0,45,2Red1,b'r7/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3P4/7r/P4p2/1P2nP1P/3R1R1K b - -',28. Rxe2 was mandatory but hopeless.
46,0,46,2Rxh2+,b'r7/ppp3p1/3p2k1/3P4/8/P4p2/1P2nP1r/3R1R1K w - -',0-1. 29. Kxh2 Rh8#.  White got into serious difficulty by intiating tactical operations in the center prior to castling.  Black always had defensive resources based on exploiting the white king position.  A miscalculation by white left him a piece down which is a serious material deficit.
47,1,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a lightly annotated game which features an English-type setup against an Old Indian Defense.  The game starts as a slow positional maneuvering battle but turns tactical around move 22 when I offer an exchange sacrifice for the chance to cement two knights on the 6th rank!
48,1,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',2. e4 could transpose into the Pirc or Modern.
49,1,2,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pppnpppp/3p4/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Another possibility is 2...Bg4 followed by this move.
50,1,3,c6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pp4/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This move gives Black pawn control of d5 and also prepares a later break in the center.
51,1,4,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Not a very popular opening these days the move 6...Be7 makes the Black position more passive than the Fianchetto.  Still Blacks position is solid and without any weakness and his plan of a center break with ...d5 is straightforward and good.
52,1,5,d3,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',7. d4 would head straight for the main lines but this move keeps control of e4.
53,1,6,Rb1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',Here I wasn't too sure how to proceed as I am not too booked up on the Old-Indian.  The best way to play this is 8. e4 which not only prevents Black's ...d5 break in the center but leads to a Botvinnik setup where Black's knights are misplaced.  ***FYI*** the Black knights need to be on c6 and e7.  White then proceeds with h3 and Be3 with a better game and the plan of queenside expansion.  
54,1,7,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',Black is at least equal here.
55,1,8,b4,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/2NP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - b3',Since I have defaulted to the standard English queenside counterplay I have to stick with the plan and play consistently.  A decent plan now is better than the best plan later.
56,1,9,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/2NP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',Here the immediate 9...d5 looks strong.  In fact the more I look at this ...Re8 looks like a strategic error.  It seems that I can now hold up the ...d5 advance and Black's passive position will become rather uncomfortable.
57,1,10,1Qb3,b'r1b1r1k1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/1QNP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RB2RK1 b - -',The Black setup has left the light-squared bishop at home to defend the queenside so the only benefit to this move is to hold up ...d5.  My plan of advancing the queenside pawns to create weaknesses is the quickest active plan for White as it follows logically from my 8th and 9th moves.  The only problem with this is that it's rather easy for Black to stop as he does in the game by routing the queen's knight to e6 via f8.
58,1,11,1Nf8,b'r1b1rnk1/ppq1bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/1QNP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RB2RK1 w - -',A standard plan in these positions the knight will come to e6 where it will exert pressure on the d4-square.  Here Black opts to keep the light-squared bishop at home often times due to the lack of space Black will play ...Bg4 followed by ...Bxf3 to weaken the d4-square and create more breathing room for his pieces.  Only then will the knight come to e6 when Black is doing fine.
59,1,12,1Bg5,b'r1b1rnk1/ppq1bppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/1PP5/1QNP1NP1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',Taking an opportunity to exchange the knight on f6 to weaken the d5-square a consequence of Black's passive play.
60,1,13,1a3,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2ppnb2/4p3/1PP5/PQNP1NP1/4PPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',I like this better than a4 as knight on e6 can jump into c5 the pawn advances to b5.  Black has held up my queenside expansion however I still have a slight plus due to the space advantage on the queenside and the initiative provided by holding up Black's counterplay.  I now have to switch to the center in order to keep my initiative.
61,1,14,1e3,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2p1p/2ppnbp1/4p3/1PP5/PQNPPNP1/5PBP/1R3RK1 b - -',With no obvious tactical shots or immediate way to open the position I need to slowly improve my position by cementing my center control and getting the rooks to their optimal squares.  A space advantage is a static imbalance.  As long as Black's counterplay is stifled I have time to maneuver into a favorable position and when I am ready to open the position with attacking chances.

108,5,0,Nh3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/7N/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This move (1) does not control center squares and allows Black to take the center with pawns and (2) develops the knight to a position that does not control KR4/h4.  The weakness of not developing to KB3/f3 will be seen.

129,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A Petrosian patent. Most if not all of Petrosians chess games as white are opened with either d4 or c4. However just for the beginners out there it is important to note that neither e4 d4 nor c4 (and Nf3 and g3) are all equal openings with neither one being more effective than the other. It is only a matter of preference.
130,6,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"Korchnoi responds with d5 which is slightly odd for his style of play as most of the time (86% of the time in fact) Korchnoi replies to 1.d4 with Nf6 and either a Gruenfeld or an Indian. So with d5 Korchnoi might have something prepared... 

On 1...d5 Black is simply mimicking white's move. This can lead to the many variations in the Queens Gambit Declined such as the Slav Tarrasch Semi-Tarrasch Defence as well as the Torre Attack and other uncommon opening variations. It is a perfectly logical and playable move."
131,6,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Less common then c4 but perfectly playable.
132,6,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Once again mimicking whites move. White now has two main choices c4 which leads to the QGD or Bg5 which may become a Torre Attack depending on other moves played.
133,6,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Accepting the 'gambit' pawn is playable but white can easily win back the pawn. (4.Qa4  or 4.e3 b5 5.a4 c6 6.axb cxb 7. b3!)
134,6,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',We have now reached the main line of the Queens gambit declined which is usually reached after the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 (Although 4.Bg5 is more common.) Now after 4...Be7 and 5.Bg5 play continues as normal but with blacks next move he introduces the Tarrasch Defence.
135,6,6,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',"Here we are at the Tarrasch Defence. 

Usually in the QGD blacks main goals are e5 or c5. Here with the Tarrasch Defence black achieves this goal early however it can lead to a slight strategic advantage to white."
136,6,7,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"By far the best and most common move. If 5...exd then the Tarrasch Defence is introduced or if 5...Nxd5 then the Semi-Tarrasch is introduced.

With the Tarrasch Defence black accepts an isolated d pawn for smooth development and plenty of space. Many GM's have played the Tarrasch Defence now and again including former World Champion Garry Kasparov until Karpov with the white pieces outplayed him in the World Championship match. In this defence white plays against black's isolated pawn while black tries to use his piece mobility to lauch an attack.

Unlike it's cousin the Semi-Tarrasch Defence does not give black an islolated d-pawn but instead allows white to build a strong center. (See game)"
137,6,8,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',After a slightly uncommon move order we reach the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. As said before white obtains an advantage after the following moves.
138,6,9,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',Logical and in my opinion the best move. Black is voluntarily allowing his knight to be driven around the board there is no reason why white should not do just that.
139,6,10,Nxc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The only correct move as it gains tempi and trades off pieces to lessen a future attack. However the disadvantages are obvious as white's b pawn has now been converted to a c pawn increasing white's centeral majority.
140,6,11,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and Bb4  accomplish.
141,6,12,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1b1PP3/5N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',As mentioned this is played to trade off the minor pieces however after the trade black will be left with a very passive white bishop compared to white's active bishop. Therefore other ways of reaching equality have been tried such as Nc6 9. Bc4 b5! as played by Fischer against Spassky as Bxb5 loses to Qa5 .
142,6,13,1Qxd2,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Although black has suceeded in exchanging two sets of minor pieces white doesn't really mind as his two minor pieces are very well placed.
143,6,14,1O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',"Now that the position has simplified we can analyse the position. There are only two sets of minor pieces on the board but white's bishop can come into play actively unlike black's white bishop while white's knight is also actively placed. White also has a large centeral majority and although the king looks awkward in the center its is perfectly safe. 

Because of his small centeral majority black's chances are on the queenside with his 2-1 pawn majority on the left wing. However it will only be towards the endgame when black can exploit this and he must be content with developing and defending himself for now. 

White on the other hand is looking for the d5 advance to create a passed pawn and even if it is not queened it will draw blacks forces away from his king where upon white will lauch an attack."
144,6,15,1Bc4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',The best spot for the bishop as it helps the d5 advance. Furthermore Bd3 and Be2 block the e and d files which white will want to place his rooks on.
145,6,16,1Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',At first sight this is a simply logical move as it develops the knight to the 'best' square. However if white can get the d5 advance in black will be forced to lose time moving his knight a second time. Therefore there is alot to be said about Nd7. So blacks move is completely in contrary with what is required and there is nothing wrong however it should be noted that Nd7 should also be considered as a possible move.
146,6,17,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White needs his rooks on the open files to break through. Also after the coming d5 exd exd the e-file will be open and white's king could be vulnerable.
147,6,18,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Blacks best move. He prepares the fianchetto which will activate his trapped bishop.
148,6,19,1Rfe1,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Whites rooks mobolise as quickly as possible. Another possible move is Rfd1 when the a-rook goes to c1 however the prospects for the e-file opening are very good. Furthermore white needs a protector of e4 as after Bb7 black might have nasty discoveries on the unprotected pawn.
149,6,20,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Logical follow up.
150,6,21,1Rad1,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',White has now completed his objective and has mobilised his rooks and is ready to play d5. 
151,6,22,1Ne7,b'r2q1rk1/pb2nppp/1p2p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',With this move black anticipates the coming d5 advance and although it is too late to stop the pawn after d5 exd exd black has Nf5 and Nd6 to blockade the pawn.
152,6,23,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/pb2nppp/1p2p3/3P4/2B1P3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',! With all white's forces ready he breaks through. Now he must watch for the Nd6 blockading maneuvre as mentioned previously.
153,6,24,1exd5,b'r2q1rk1/pb2nppp/1p6/3p4/2B1P3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',It is necessary to exchange pawns to free the f5 square. 
154,6,25,1exd5,b'r2q1rk1/pb2nppp/1p6/3P4/2B5/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',White has now obtained what he wants a passed pawn but he must now work on trying to queen the pawn.
155,6,26,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/3P1n2/2B5/5N2/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',With the idea of Nd6 blockading the pawn but Petrosian has an excellent move.
156,6,27,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/3PNn2/2B5/8/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',! This is in my opinion an excellent move because it prepares to bring the knight to c6 where it will either cause much annoyance for black if he leaves it there or he will have to exchange it for his white bishop turning the passed d pawn into a passed c pawn meaning the blockading move Nd6 is useless.
157,6,28,1Nd6,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p1n4/3PN3/2B5/8/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',So black blocks the passed pawn but with the Nc6! move coming he brings a little trouble about himself.
158,6,29,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pNn4/3P4/2B5/8/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',"! Now black has 3 choices
1. trade the bishop for the knight (See game)
2. Attempt to ignore the knight by Qf6 after which white will protect the bishop and black will have to endure a awful middle game due to the well placed knight.
3. An attempt to win a piece with 18...Nxc4 when after 19.Nxd8 Nxd2 20.Nxb7 Rab8 21.Na5!! bxa5 Rxd2 he is left with 2 doubled A pawns which have no chance of becoming passed while white still has the passed d pawn."
159,6,30,1Bxc6,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/1pbn4/3P4/2B5/8/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',? From all the alternatives mentioned this is the worst continuation although it temporarily wins a piece black has no way to block the future passed c pawn and with less pieces on the board white's passed pawn is increasing in power and this ultimately leads to blacks downfall.
160,6,31,1dxc6,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/1pPn4/8/2B5/8/P2Q1PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',So now white's passed pawn has turned from d - c meaning the Nd6 is completely pointless therefore black exchanges it for white's bishop.
161,6,32,2Qf4,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/1pP5/8/2n2Q2/8/P4PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',! Winning back the piece as there is a discovered attack on the queen. Wrong is Qxd8? when Raxd8 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 22.c7 loses to Rf8! (eg 23. Rd1 b5! 24.Rd8 Nb6!.) So black must now give back the piece.
162,6,33,2Rxd6,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/1pPR4/8/5Q2/8/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',! White keeps the queens on the board (instead of Qxd6) which allows him to attack on the K-side while blacks pieces are tied down to defending the passed c-pawn. This move also gains a tempi which will help white.
163,6,34,2Qc7,b'r4rk1/p1q2ppp/1pPR4/8/5Q2/8/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',With the sensible and logical idea of blockading the pawn.
164,6,35,2g3,b'r4rk1/p1q2ppp/1pPR4/8/5Q2/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Petrosian realises that black has no winning prospects and cannot do anything as his  pawn majority on the left wing is of no value in comparison to white's passed pawn. Therefore he takes his time firstly by giving his king some 'luft' so that the Re1 is free to maneuvre if necessary.
165,6,36,2h6,b'r4rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/8/5Q2/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Black wants to give his king some luft to prevent back rank mates as there could be many threats to the back rank to come. However perhaps such a weakening of the kings position mightnt be necessary at this point in time as white has no direct threats against the back rank.
166,6,37,2Qe5,b'r4rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/4Q3/8/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 b - -',! With this move (and the next) White demonstrates his complete superiority over black as he can take his time to maneuvre since black cannot do anything productive. Rae8 loses to 24.Qxe8! Rxe8 25. Rxe8 Kh7 26.Red8 since the passed pawn is too strong.
167,6,38,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/4Q3/8/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 w - -',With nothing to do black hopes to at least prevent white from queening the pawn with all his forces. However this allows white to launch an attack. 
168,6,39,2Qd5,b'2r2rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/3Q4/8/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 b - -',! Petrosian protects his pawn again while centeralising his queen to the best square possible. White is completely dominating and the only thing which remains to be given a useful job is the rook.
169,6,40,2Kh7,b'2r2r2/p1q2ppk/1pPR3p/3Q4/8/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Black is simply bidding his time however I think this is a psycological surrender as Petrosian with his next move realises blacks 'surrender' and plans an attack.
170,6,41,2Re4,b'2r2r2/p1q2ppk/1pPR3p/3Q4/4R3/6P1/P4P1P/6K1 b - -',Instead of the Rd7 which can be played anytime Petrosian plans the attack. Now his rook can come to f4 g4 and h4.
171,6,42,2Kg8,b'2r2rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/3Q4/4R3/6P1/P4P1P/6K1 w - -',Bidding time.
172,6,43,2Kg2,b'2r2rk1/p1q2pp1/1pPR3p/3Q4/4R3/6P1/P4PKP/8 b - -',! With black's forces distracted by the passed pawn white advances his king as well as the g pawn which will be used to break into black's king. This move becomes more apparent after black's 31st move as it also prevents any checks on the back rank.
173,6,44,2a6,b'2r2rk1/2q2pp1/ppPR3p/3Q4/4R3/6P1/P4PKP/8 w - -',Preparing b5 to give some hopeful counterplay but right now black is quite lost.
174,6,45,2h4,b'2r2rk1/2q2pp1/ppPR3p/3Q4/4R2P/6P1/P4PK1/8 b - h3',Black can do nothing against this slow but steady advance of the pawns.
175,6,46,2g4,b'2r2rk1/2q2pp1/p1PR3p/1p1Q4/4R1PP/8/P4PK1/8 b - -',White is now preparing the g5 break. Just watch how Petrosian calmly maneuvers his pieces.
176,6,47,2Re2,b'2r2r2/2q2ppk/p1PR3p/1p1Q4/6PP/8/P3RPK1/8 b - -',! A very flexible move. The reason behind this move is that when white plays g5 black might block the position with h5 and g6 when the hole on f6 will become a weakness. Re2 allows the queen to come to f3 so that if the h5 g6 maneuvre is played the queen can exploit the hole on f6. Furthermore the rook is better positioned here as it can come to the c-file or d-file if necessary where as on e4 it cannot come to c4. It sometimes seems unecessary to do this move and if black had certain threats/counterplay it probably would be a waste of a move. However black do anything productive so white can afford to take his time.
177,6,48,2Kh8,b'2r2r1k/2q2pp1/p1PR3p/1p1Q4/6PP/8/P3RPK1/8 w - -',Black is still bidding his time...
178,6,49,3g5,b'2r2r1k/2q2pp1/p1PR3p/1p1Q2P1/7P/8/P3RPK1/8 b - -',!! Finally the g5 break. If hxg hxg black will lose quickly due to the open h-file.
179,6,50,3h5,b'2r2r1k/2q2pp1/p1PR4/1p1Q2Pp/7P/8/P3RPK1/8 w - -',Blacks best move. He blocks the position around the king but as mentioned when the queen comes to f3 he will have a hole on f6.
180,6,51,3Rd2,b'2r2r1k/2q2pp1/p1PR4/1p1Q2Pp/7P/8/P2R1PK1/8 b - -',White protects the rook so enabling his queen to come to f3. He doesn't mind giving up the e-file as it is of no use to him.
181,6,52,3Rfe8,b'2r1r2k/2q2pp1/p1PR4/1p1Q2Pp/7P/8/P2R1PK1/8 w - -',Black takes control of the e-file but this comes too late. Only now can one appreciate the importance of the 26.Kg2! move as if it were on g1 black would have drawing chances with Re1  and Rc1.
182,6,53,3Qf3,b'2r1r2k/2q2pp1/p1PR4/1p4Pp/7P/5Q2/P2R1PK1/8 b - -',White finally achieves his goal. Although there is no weakness on the f6 square yet blacks next move is forced to protect the h pawn.
183,6,54,3g6,b'2r1r2k/2q2p2/p1PR2p1/1p4Pp/7P/5Q2/P2R1PK1/8 w - -',The only move to protect the h-pawn but now the f6 square will be a permanant weakness.
184,6,55,Ref8,b'2r2r1k/2q2p2/p1PR2p1/1p1R2Pp/7P/5Q2/P4PK1/8 w - -',Black's f pawn is also a weakness and since the rook is doing nothing useful on the e-file he bolsters the pawn. 
185,6,56,3Rf6,b'2r2r1k/2q2p2/p1P2Rp1/1p1R2Pp/7P/5Q2/P4PK1/8 b - -',! Making full use of the weakness and applying more pressure to the f-pawn. Furthermore he threatens the decisive Rd7!
186,6,57,3Qe7,b'2r2r1k/4qp2/p1P2Rp1/1p1R2Pp/7P/5Q2/P4PK1/8 w - -',A final mistake. The point of this move was so that after Rd7 Qe8 the queen protects the f-pawn however Korchnoi under time pressure misses the following combination.
187,6,58,3Rxg6,b'2r1qr1k/3R1p2/p1P3R1/1p4Pp/7P/5Q2/P4PK1/8 b - -',!! A very pretty move as fxg allows Qc3  followed by mate.
188,6,59,3Qe5,b'2r2r1k/3R1p2/p1P3R1/1p2q1Pp/7P/5Q2/P4PK1/8 w - -',?? Blunder due to time pressure but black was lost anyways.
189,6,60,3Qxh5#,b'2r2r1k/3R1p2/p1P3R1/1p2q1PQ/7P/8/P4PK1/8 b - -',An extremely complex game showing some ideas in the Semi-Tarrasch Defence the importance of recognising a completely dominating position and taking your time to unleash the killer blow as well as how to set goals (such as the penetration of the weak f6 square) and work towards them.
190,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1. e4 has many good points.  It attempts to secure space in the center and open lines for the f1 bishop and the queen.  The g1 knight might also develop via e2 in some lines.  Two of the fundamental elements of chess: space and time are well served by the move.  There is a slight weakening to the d4 and f4 squares which should also be noted.
191,7,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Just as logical for black as for white.
192,7,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A developing move that centralizes the knight and attacks black's e-pawn.  Centralization is a key concept in chess because peieces tend to grow stronger nearer the center.  A piece's power is tied to its mobility and centralized pieces tend to be more mobile.
193,7,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A playable but passive defense.  It secures the e-pawn but also hinders the development of the f8 bishop.
194,7,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Siezing more space and opening a line for the c1 bishop.  It again threatens to win the e-pawn.  Developing while making threats is a sign of the initiative.   The initiative is another critical concept in chess where one side is pressing the other and limiting their choices.
195,7,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An overly aggressive move that is actually seen fairly often in similar positions by developing players until they learn about its drawbacks.  This is a tactical solution to the defense of the e-pawn that has a strategic drawback which will become clear.
196,7,6,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Capturing on e5 with the d-pawn is the correct play.
197,7,7,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',4. ...dxe5 loses material to 5. Qxd8  Kxd8 6. Nxe5.  Material or force is another basic element in chess.  You must maintain the material status quo or risk being overwhelmed.  Notice how the bishop has moved twice to capture a knight which has only moved once.  Black is beginning to lag behind in development or in the element of time.
198,7,8,Qxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',5. gxf3 is possible but it would result in a defect in white's pawn structure.  Pawn structure is another critical elelment in understanding chess.  In this case 5. gxf3 would give white doubled pawns on the f-file.  The pawns cannot defend one another and the f2 pawn's mobility is restricted.  White has continued his development by recapturing with the queen and secured the two bishops.
199,7,9,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black has restored material equilibrium  but at the cost of the two bishops.  Two bishops are more mobile than bishop and knight and they are usually easier to coordinate.  Notice that white has one piece developed and is on the move while black has no developed piece.
200,7,10,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',With the not-so-subtle threat on f7.  Developing while making threats reduces your opponent's options.  White is making good use of the initiative.
201,7,11,Qf6,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Propably hoping for 7. Qxf6 Nxf6 where black has caught up in development.  White however has no intention of helping out his opponent in that way.  Better was 6. ...Nf6 but 7. Qb3 still leads to an advantage as in the famous game Paul Morphy vs. Duke Karl and Count Isouard. 6. ...Qe7 is another try.
202,7,12,Qb3,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Creating a nice bishop-queen battery along the a2 g8 diagonal. and threatening 8. Qxb7.  The absence of black's light square bishop is felt almost immediately.
203,7,13,Bc5,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',A counter threat that gets white's attention.
204,7,14,O-O,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',White unlike black can respond to the threat with a natural developing move.  Castling secures the king behind a phalanx of pawns and allows the rook to get into the game.
205,7,15,b6,b'rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',8. ...b6 does not help black's development and further weakens the white squares.  8. ...Bb6 was probably better.
206,7,16,Nc3,b'rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Another centralizing developing move with the threat of 10. Nd5 gaining even more time because of the attack on the queen.
207,7,17,Bd4,b'rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/4p3/2BbP3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',9. ...Ne7 would've challenged white's control over d5.  Black has moved an already developed piece twice before completing the development of his other pieces. 9. ...Bd4 is a waste of time in a position where black already trails white in that element.  Neglecting development is one of the most common mistakes in chess.
208,7,18,1Nd5,b'rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/3Np3/2BbP3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Now white gets a free move since black must save the queen.
209,7,19,1Qd8,b'rn1qk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/3Np3/2BbP3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',White has three pieces developed to black's one and it is white's turn to move.  An advantage in the element of time is a temporary one.  Ideally you want to cash it in for an advantage in a more permament elelment such as material.  A lead in development means that open lines and attack are the order of the day.  Play passively and your opponent will catch right up to you in terms of time.
210,7,20,1c3,b'rn1qk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/3Np3/2BbP3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Another free move for white.  The c-pawn fights for control over d4 and forces the bishop to retreat.
211,7,21,1Bc5,b'rn1qk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2bNp3/2B1P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',No choice if black wishes to preserve material equality.
212,7,22,1Rd1,b'rn1qk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2bNp3/2B1P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',Rooks belong on open files and the d-file is the only open file on the board.  Additionally there is threat of another free knight move exposing an attack on the queen on d8.
213,7,23,1Qc8,b'rnq1k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2bNp3/2B1P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R1BR2K1 w kq -',Black still has only one developed piece.  A move such as 12. ...Nd7 would expose the white square weakness on the queenside allowing a move such as 13. Bb5 threating 14. Bxd7  or 14. Bc6 but at least it would've developed another piece.  Notice how black's knights and rooks are still on their original squares.
214,7,24,1Ne3,b'rnq1k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2b1p3/2B1P3/1QP1N3/PP3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',This time the threat on f7 is renewed and black's queen cannot come to its defense.

216,7,26,1Bxf7+,b'rnq1k1nr/p1p2Bpp/1p6/4p3/4P3/1QP1b3/PP3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',An intermidiate move which allows white to win a pawn and rob black of the ability to castle.
217,7,27,1Bxe3,b'rnq2knr/p1p2Bpp/1p6/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Now white recaptures the piece after pocketing the extra pawn.  White has gained an advantage in the element of material while maintaining his advantage in the element of time.
218,7,28,1Na6,b'r1q2knr/p1p2Bpp/np6/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',It is difficult to make suggestions in such cases but perhaps 15. ...Nf6 would've been better. Black can always meet Bd5 with c6.
219,7,29,1Be6,b'r1q2knr/p1p3pp/np2B3/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Redeploying the bishop to a more secure square while simultaneously attacking the queen.
220,7,30,1Qe8,b'r3qknr/p1p3pp/np2B3/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Black would love to be able to play 17. ...Rd8 challenging white's control over the d-file.
221,7,31,1Rd7,b'r3qknr/p1pR2pp/np2B3/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',But white is too far ahead in development.  He invades the seventh rank with the threat of Rf7  winning the queen.
222,7,32,1Ne7,b'r3qk1r/p1pRn1pp/np2B3/4p3/4P3/1QP1B3/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',Forced but insufficient.
223,7,33,1Bg5,b'r3qk1r/p1pRn1pp/np2B3/4p1B1/4P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Yet another developing move that contains a threat but this one had to be calculated precisely.
224,7,34,1Nc5,b'r3qk1r/p1pRn1pp/1p2B3/2n1p1B1/4P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',This family fork of the queen rook and bishop looks like an effective resource.  Black has finally gotten some pieces into the game but is it in time?
225,7,35,1Bxe7+,b'r3qk1r/p1pRB1pp/1p2B3/2n1p3/4P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',White has correctly calculated a forced sequence of moves and knows that he is in fact winning more material.  Black must recapture on e7.
226,7,36,1Qxe7,b'r4k1r/p1pRq1pp/1p2B3/2n1p3/4P3/1QP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',The only legal move.

228,7,38,2Nxb3,b'r4k1r/p1p1R1pp/1p2B3/4p3/4P3/1nP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',White cannot capture the knight on the next move because his rook on e7 is hanging.
229,7,39,2Rf7+,b'r4k1r/p1p2Rpp/1p2B3/4p3/4P3/1nP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',White can however play the rook to f7 where it is protected.  Because the move is also check black must move his king.
230,7,40,2Ke8,b'r3k2r/p1p2Rpp/1p2B3/4p3/4P3/1nP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',The king must move and that gives white time to capture the knight on b3.
231,7,41,2Bxb3,b'r3k2r/p1p2Rpp/1p6/4p3/4P3/1BP5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',After the smoke clears white is a piece ahead has an extra pawn and has a rook on the seventh while black's rooks remain disconnected on their original squares.  White's advantage is overwhelming.

236,7,46,2Rc6,b'r2k3r/p4B2/1pR3p1/4p2p/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',White is letting black coordinate his rooks which I would've tried to prevent but it hardly matters since white is up so much material.

His lead in development was so great that he was able to continue to attack and win even more material.  By the time black finally got untangled the material deficit was so great that resistance was futile.

This move is not to my taste.  The Bishop has been placed on a square that leads to a favourable capture for Black (2...Bxh3) since the subsequent White recapture of material (3. Nxh3) means a poorly developed Knight ('dim') on the outside edge of the board ('rim').  "

This pawn move hinders future development.  It also fails to assist in White's fight for the centre.  5. d4 seems to be a better move.  5. 0-0 is another option.

Notice how White's own pawns prevent him from developing his Knight and maximizing his Bishop.  His pieces are scattered along the outer edges of the board in an uncoordinated fashion. "

In essence inviting Black to open up the centre and begin a vicious assault.  Six out of White's first ten moves have been pawn moves.  His lack of development will have dire consequences.  "

The pawn White just captured was doing him a favour by helping to keep the centre closed.  Since the White king is in the open centre and lacking pawn shelter Black will be able to exert a lot of pressure on him."

13. exf6? by White will be met with a discovered check (by the Rook on e8 when Black moves his Bishop).  The crushing attack/mate will more than compensate for the Knight.
