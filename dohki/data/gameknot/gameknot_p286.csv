""One of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. Because the bishop is placed on a long diagonal (either h1-a8 or a1-h8) it controls a lot of squares and can become a powerful offensive weapon. However a fianchettoed position also presents some opportunities for the opposing player: if the fianchettoed bishop can be exchanged the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the king-side). Therefore exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly especially if the enemy bishop of the same colour is still on the board.""

no kidding..."

It was a very positional type game and with the white pieces I establish what I considered to be a very favorable position with two handsomely posted pieces. While the board was somewhat locked down I felt that I had a nice space advantage and the more active pieces. The main problem was that I just couldn't seem to break through. My opponent who was apparently playing off of his heels heading into and during the middlegame fights back very admirably and has me on the very unexpected defensive. He ends up pushing a pawn down my throat that forces me to lose my last piece defending against his promotion. The real beauty of the position is that while I am down a piece that piece is a bishop and as you know lone bishops can be dodged by a crafty king. My king runs an end sweep around his remaining pawns and ends up trapping the enemy king! This really is a pretty nifty draw - I hope you enjoy:)

177,5,46,4Bd6,b'2b5/6k1/3B2p1/1p1pPpNp/1n1P1P1P/6P1/8/6K1 b - -',Lo and behold we are now back to equal material but black is now better positionally due to his passed pawn! The saving grace for white is that his pawns are ALL on opposite colored squares than the enemy bishop so white is not at all reluctant to trade off his bishop for black's powerful knight.
178,5,47,4Nc2,b'2b5/6k1/3B2p1/1p1pPpNp/3P1P1P/6P1/2n5/6K1 w - -',Naturally black sees this and will not allow it.

185,5,54,Ba6,b'8/5k2/b5p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/N5P1/1p6/6K1 w - -',You know he is going to d3.
186,5,55,5Kf2,b'8/5k2/b5p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/N5P1/1p3K2/8 b - -',The white king is just one square too far away to guard d3.
187,5,56,5Kd2,b'8/5k2/6p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/3K4/1b6 b - -',White is totally demoralized after blowing such a beautiful middle game advantage and realistically can only hope to salvage a draw. If my pawns were on white squares I would have resigned at this point but since they are all safe from the enemy bishop perhaps I can race around the queenside and lock in the black king behind his own position.
188,5,57,5Be4,b'8/5k2/6p1/3pPp1p/3PbP1P/6P1/3K4/8 w - -',? Although a little tough to tell this move helps to blow the win for black. If 54...Ke7 then black could head off having to protect the crucial c7 square. Why is c7 important? Let's take a look................
189,5,58,Bd3,b'8/4k3/6p1/3pPp1p/1K1P1P1P/3b2P1/8/8 w - -',? Again black does white a favor by not moving his king towards the queenside.
190,5,59,5Ka5,b'8/4k3/6p1/K2pPp1p/3P1P1P/3b2P1/8/8 b - -',It's all square counting now. 
191,5,60,Bc4,b'8/3k4/1K4p1/3pPp1p/2bP1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',Obviously 58...Kc8 gives white winning chances (black's g pawn becomes a target).
192,5,61,Ke7,b'8/1K2k3/6p1/3pPp1p/2bP1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',? Assures the draw for white.
193,5,62,6Kc7,b'8/2K1k3/6p1/3pPp1p/2bP1P1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',! Draw locked up. Black is now fully hemmed in behind his own pawns and white can protect c7 from both b6 and b8.
194,5,63,Bd7+,b'2K5/3bk3/6p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',A frustration check that is easily sidestepped by returning to the righteous c7.
195,5,64,Ke8,b'4k3/8/2K1b1p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',Black tries another way....
196,5,65,6Kd6,b'4k3/8/3Kb1p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',....but white threatens to gain material.
197,5,66,7Kc7,b'8/2K1k3/6p1/1b1pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',I just love c7!
198,5,67,Be8,b'4b3/2K1k3/6p1/3pPp1p/3P1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',And a draw was confirmed. I felt like I dodged a BIG bullet in this one.  Many thanks to ricardopr for the great game.

220,7,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"1.d4 is usually slower than 1.e4 but it gives white much more opportunity for a lasting initiative and it is suitable for players who like to play slow positional games with semi closed pawn structure in the center. If I play with white pieces I always play with 1.e4 and try to open up the center by pawn exchanges in order to make the game explode tactically. I usually avoid a closed center because it is boring to me and I don't feel quite comfortable 
with it. In this game I'll try to open up the center as soon as possible and seize the initiative in the right moment."
221,7,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I usually prefer this move to 1...Nf6 which leads to Indian lines of defense. 1...d5 is the immediate challenge of the center which usually leads to the Queen's Gambit Slav-defense or Catalan opening
222,7,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',this move usually leads to the Colle system which is a slow and boring game or a transposition to the queen's gambit. White is trying to develop his kingside as soon as possible and to castle on the kingside.
223,7,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is a very flexible move. It protects my very important d-pawn and opens a3-f8 diagonal for my dark square bishop. Although it shuts the h3-c8 diagonal for my light square bishop but as you will see black usually doesn't need this diagonal for the bishop in this structure.
224,7,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',This move has been pioneered by Emanuel Lasker. White's idea is to play e3 and to have no problems with developing his dark square bishop. The bishop could be tickled immediately by playing f6 but f6 is not a very good idea because my knight will lose his best square and h4-d8 diagonal will be closed to my queen. Also after playing f6 white will be in a great lead in development and will maintain the initiative for a long time.
225,7,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',"This is the most preferred move by opening books. Although it is a self pin but black's queen won't stay on d8 for long. The most important thing is that my knight cannot be attacked by any other white piece for a long time so this is not a really painful pin.

226,7,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This move was a surprise to me. Obviously white's best move here was to play c4 and challenge my strong central pawn. If White had played 4.c4 then after 4...c6 4.Nc3 dxc4!? 5.e4 b5 6.e5 h6 the game would be transposed to a form of queen's gambit called the Botvinnik System; which is one of the sharpest modern openings and leads to an unbalanced and very dynamic game.
227,7,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq c6',A very important move! Now I can exchange my side pawn with white's central pawn. Also my queen now is free and can come into the game in the right moment. Now I'm planning to put my queen on a5 and exploiting the pin by playing Ne4. This plan is similar to black's plan in the Cambridge Springs Variation of the Queen’s Gambit Declined. If black can execute this plan he will equalize in an early stage of the game and will seize the initiative from white very soon.
228,7,8,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is the most reasonable reply. White protects his d-pawn and opens a diagonal for his light square bishop.
229,7,9,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3p4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black exchanges his flank pawn with white's central one a good positional achievement!

I don't like this move for white because it forces exchange of light square bishops and this is completely favorable for black.

White's initiative is fading by this move and black is almost equalized. 
It was much better for white to first take the bishop on d7 and then 
take on d4. These slight differences may not look very important in the 
first view; but these differences in fact can play a huge role in the nature 
of the game's continuation. 
Now I am out of opening book and I should plan for the middlegame. My first objective is to seize white's initiative. If I take White's bishop he has to retake with the knight and then I consider playing Qa5  forcing white to play the reactive Nc3. Then I can put a huge pressure on e1-a5 diagonal by playing Bb4 and white is now has to make just a defensive moves. Also I want to bring my king into a safe home then try to open up the center and deny white's king from castling. If I succeed in keeping my opponent's king in the center then I can attack him relentlessly!"

I could continue my attack aggressively by playing Ne4?! but I first have to consider the fact that I have problems with my development.

Bxd2  13.Qxd2 Qxd2  14.Kxd2 I can claim that white is much better. Black can't attack any longer and his pawn on e4 is so vulnerable. Also White has got a fantastic outpost for his knight on e5.

328,9,49,3a4,b'4b3/5k2/8/3p1p2/PPpP1Pq1/4P3/2Q3P1/6K1 b - -',Of course.
329,9,50,4b5,b'4b3/8/4k3/1P1p1p2/P1pP1Pq1/4P3/2Q3P1/6K1 b - -',And the race is on. Black is forced on the defensive.
330,9,51,4Bh5,b'8/8/4k3/1P1p1p1b/P1pP1Pq1/4P3/2Q3P1/6K1 w - -',Interesting idea - black is attempting to come in through the back door and exchange queens. Then his king and bishop will be more readily available to stop my queenside advance.
331,9,52,4Kf2,b'8/8/4k3/1P1p1p1b/P1pP1Pq1/4P3/2Q2KP1/8 b - -',I realize black's plan and put a stop to any queen exchange.
332,9,53,4c3,b'8/8/4k3/1P1p1p1b/P2P1Pq1/2p1P3/2Q2KP1/8 w - -',Trying to sucker me away from the second rank to deliver check and hopefully perpetual check.
333,9,54,4a5,b'8/8/4k3/PP1p1p1b/3P1Pq1/2p1P3/2Q2KP1/8 b - -',No need to go pawn snatching - I see the importance of protecting the second rank. I simply push my passers.
334,9,55,4Kd6,b'8/8/3k4/PP1p1p1b/3P1Pq1/2p1P3/2Q2KP1/8 w - -',Rushing to stop the enemy pawn advance.
335,9,56,4a6,b'8/8/P2k4/1P1p1p1b/3P1Pq1/2p1P3/2Q2KP1/8 b - -',The a pawn is my queen candidate.
336,9,57,4Qd1,b'8/8/P2k4/1P1p1p1b/3P1P2/2p1P3/2Q2KP1/3q4 w - -',?! The defining move - black is attempting to promote his c pawn via this proposed exchange.
337,9,58,4Qxc3,b'8/8/P2k4/1P1p1p1b/3P1P2/2Q1P3/5KP1/3q4 b - -',As black's c pawn was just a little too close to promotion I take him out. Now the trick will be to weather the storm and evade black's attack. Luckily for me I have my g pawn to maneuver around if need be and if given ANY time at all me queen will easily return to the action to defend. It's going to be a good one!
338,9,59,Qxb5,b'8/8/P2k4/1q1p1p1b/3P1P2/2Q1P1K1/6P1/8 w - -',! Very nice! (45...Qg4  46. Kh2 Qh4  47. Kg1 fails to further threats because white controls the e1 square.) Black regains equality.
339,9,60,4Qc5+,b'8/8/P2k4/1qQp1p1b/3P1P2/4P1K1/6P1/8 b - -',! White punches right back! 
340,9,61,4dxc5+,b'8/8/P2k4/2Pp1p1b/5P2/4P1K1/6P1/8 b - -',This pawn can't be taken because of the promotion threat. While black is tied up dealing with the a and c pawn issues white will be able to go pawn hunting after 47...Kc6 48. Kh4!
341,9,62,Bg4,b'8/8/P1k5/2Pp1p2/5PbK/4P3/6P1/8 w - -',Black's last remaing piece gets tied down with defensive duties allowing the white king to roam.
342,9,63,Be2,b'8/8/P1k5/2Pp1pK1/5P2/4P3/4b1P1/8 w - -', Black correctly assesses that my a pawn has got to go. Any chance of winning now rests with his d pawn.
343,9,64,Bd3+,b'8/8/P1k5/2Pp1K2/5P2/3bP3/6P1/8 w - -',Nothing more than a spite check as the white king was headed to e5 anyway.
344,9,65,5e4,b'8/8/b1k5/2PpK3/4PP2/8/6P1/8 b - -',! Secures the draw. Black's d pawn falls next move no matter what.
345,9,66,5dxe4,b'8/8/b1k5/2P1K3/4pP2/8/6P1/8 w - -',Black's d pawn dies with dignity taking down an enemy with him.
346,9,67,Kxc5,b'8/8/b7/2k5/4KP2/8/6P1/8 w - -',Eliminating white's queenside threat. Black must now play to lock up enemy pawns with his bishop being supported by his king. The second race of the game now begins!
347,9,68,Bb7+,b'8/1b6/8/2k5/4KPP1/8/8/8 w - -',Another spite check. Perhaps Bc8 was better.
348,9,69,5Ke5,b'8/1b6/8/2k1K3/5PP1/8/8/8 b - -',Cutting off the black king from the real estate I will need for promotion.
349,9,70,Kc6,b'8/8/2k5/3bK1P1/5P2/8/8/8 w - -',The black king is just a step too slow. It desperately tries to get in front of the white pawns.
350,9,71,5Kf6,b'8/8/2k2K2/3b2P1/5P2/8/8/8 b - -',! White can now successfully protect the f8 square which has been selected as the square I hope to promote on.
351,9,72,5f5,b'8/3k4/5K2/3b1PP1/8/8/8/8 b - -',Since Kg7 will still be available next move white starts the march to get a queen.
352,9,73,5Kg7,b'4k3/6K1/8/3b1PP1/8/8/8/8 b - -',Wins as f8 is covered as is any conflict on f7 after white plays g6.
353,9,74,5Bc4,b'4k3/6K1/8/5PP1/2b5/8/8/8 w - -',Nothing else to do here. Black is just praying for a miracle draw.
354,9,75,6Kf6,b'5Q2/8/5KP1/1k1b4/8/8/8/8 b - -',And black graciously resigned. What a wonderful endgame! Many thanks to everlast75 for the pleasurable game. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
355,10,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Queen's pawn game one of the most popular first moves of the white along with 1. e4 Here's black has a variety of moves to reply with 1. ... d5 which usually leads to a queen's gambit 1. ... Nf6 which usually leads to Nimzo-indian or king's indian defense.
356,10,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Normally 2. c4 or 2. Nc3 are played e3 is particularly bad because it blocks the way for the white's queen's bishop.
357,10,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',A pseudo sacrifice black is trying to have a majority in the center and to open the c-file for attack althought 2. Nf6 is frequently played here this move is very good for black!

371,10,16,Rad8,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/2n5/p7/5P2/P1P1b1P1/1B1NB2P/2K4R w - -',White's knight is pinned and black is exploiting this pin with this move as a general rule take advantage of a pin as quickly as possible!

374,10,19,Rxb2,b'6k1/1p3ppp/2n5/p7/5P2/P1P1b1P1/1r2B2P/4K3 w - -',And white resigns he has no chance because of the huge material advantage of almost the same as if black had a queen and a bishop against his bishop. White played really bad but black was good enought to take advantage of his weak and aimless moves.
375,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Sorry folks I just couldn't resist the title (my apologies to Tim Blake Nelson John Turturro and George Clooney). Here is recent game vs. one of the newest members of my team adui. Since it was our first contest I had no idea what to expect. Midway through I pick up a pawn - then foolishly blunder away the small advantage I had. I don't think either side will win any FIDE titles for our play but the resulting endgame was quite interesting as the game concluded with a smothered mate (something not commonly seen). Many thanks to my new teammate for the game and I hope you enjoy:)
376,11,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Yes that's right - Mr. Scandanavian is branching out. I've been getting in some good work with the Sicilian as of late so I deploy it.
377,11,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A little early methinks but very playable.
378,11,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',?! This move was made strictly for it's experimentation value. I've gotten burned a few times recently with the line 3...Nc6 4. Bb5 and I wanted to see if I could diffuse that potential position. Yes I know it's slow and doesn't develop but like I said it was an experiment.
379,11,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',White jumps on the center with a hit on the weak f7 square and probably hopes for 4...b5 5. Bd5 Nc6 6. BxN dxN 7. QxQ KxQ and black loses the castling priveledge.
380,11,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Chasing the queen and developing.
381,11,6,Qe3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',?! Obviously the queen had to move but I don't like Qe3 as it hinders the scope of white's dark squared bishop.
382,11,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1ppppp/p1n2n2/8/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Catching up in development and intending 0-0 at some point (notice that a future 0-0-0 puts the king on a half open file and should probably be avoided).
383,11,8,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',IMHO this move signals black's intent for a very defensive set up.
384,11,9,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq b6',?! Another somewhat questionable play on my part. Like I said I was in a defensive frame of mind so I wanted to establish a solid position for my pawns. 7...Be7 was probably better.
385,11,10,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/4QN2/PPP1BPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',I remember thinking that white has somewhat declined the offer to be the aggressor. I was expecting 8. Bb3.
386,11,11,Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/2N1QN2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w k -',Rook to half open file (the c file ends up being a big area of interest throughout the rest of the game).
387,11,12,1a4,b'2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/P3P3/2N1QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b k a3',?! hmmmm....while white does have a pawn advantage on the queenside this was probably a little premature as it leads to....
388,11,13,1b4,b'2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/2N1QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w k -',! Fairly obvious but powerful all the same. White must retreat to d1 or a2 and both of those options are retreating moves to ineffectual squares.
389,11,14,1c3,b'2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/2P1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1BN1RK1 b k -',!? White pushes back with an aggressive thrust to undermine black's ideas on the queenside.
390,11,15,1bxc3,b'2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/P3P3/2p1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1BN1RK1 w k -',? Bad idea on my part. I thought about 12...a5 but was scared of 13. Bb5. Why? I'm not sure....I kind of lost my way during this portion of the game. I guess I had stubbornly made up my mind to play safe and think only of defense against this new opponent. I have successfully psyched MYSELF out!
391,11,16,1e5,b'2rq1rk1/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/4P3/P7/2N1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',! Bingo.......nice pawn push.

395,11,20,1Nc5,b'2rqnrk1/1b2bppp/p1n1p3/2NpP3/P7/4QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',? An outright blunder. My teammate gives me the very unexpected gift of a free pawn after......
396,11,21,Nxe5,b'2rqnrk1/1b3ppp/p3p3/2Qpn3/P7/5N2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Ahhhh now that's better. Finally a little breathing room.  White can't take my Ne5 because of the discovered attack on his queen.
397,11,22,1Qb4,b'2rqnrk1/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/PQ6/5N2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Threatening QxB.
398,11,23,1Nxf3+,b'2rqnrk1/1b3ppp/p3p3/3p4/PQ6/5n2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',! I give myself the exclam because I get to trade a knight from an awkward square for a knight from a strong square and also put my opponents bishop on a less than optimal square. 
399,11,24,Rc7,b'3qnrk1/1br2ppp/p3p3/3p4/PQ6/5B2/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',A rook lift to protect the vulnerable bishop on b7.

405,11,30,2Rfe1,b'2q2k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/Q2p4/P7/1Pr2B2/5PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?! I guess adui felt guilty about that last little skirmish (or did he just miss it?). I get the chance to pick up the b pawn I was so all-fired up to grab.
406,11,31,2Rac1,b'2q2k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/Q2p4/P7/1r3B2/5PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Strong - white wrenches the c file from me.
407,11,32,2Bd1,b'1q3k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/Q2p4/P7/1r6/5PPP/2RBR1K1 b - -',After a period of inactivity white's light squared bishop gets back in the game with an attack on the Rb3.
408,11,33,2Rb2,b'1q3k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/Q2p4/P7/8/1r3PPP/2RBR1K1 w - -',Rooks on the enemy's 2nd (or 7th) rank are pretty strong. Black starts trying to come up with a plan to attack the vulnerable f2 square.
409,11,34,2Bf3,b'1q3k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/Q2p4/P7/5B2/1r3PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',?! Back to f6? I didn't understand that move. I expected 27. Re7 RxR 28. BxR with white having a pretty good position.
410,11,35,2Qd6,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p2qpn2/Q2p4/P7/5B2/1r3PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',I really wanted to play Qa7 with a nasty attack on f2 but the threat of a back row mate was looming large.
411,11,36,2Qc3,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p2qpn2/3p4/P7/2Q2B2/1r3PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',! Doubling up on the c file and hitting my Rb2.
412,11,37,2Qb6,b'5k2/1b3ppp/pq2pn2/3p4/P7/2Q2B2/1r3PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',As my back row is not so weak anymore I continue my assault on f2 while protecting my rook.
413,11,38,3Be2,b'4k3/1b3ppp/pq2pn2/3p4/P7/Q7/1r2BPPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',? This bishop has been riding the short bus all game. I totally did not get this move.
414,11,39,3Ne4,b'4k3/1b3ppp/pq2p3/3p4/P3n3/Q7/1r2BPPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Since my rook was cut off from f2 by my opponent's last I go after it another way.
415,11,40,3a5,b'4k3/1b3ppp/pq2p3/P2p4/4n3/Q7/1r2BPPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',? Evidently adui missed the threat.

421,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello and welcome to my annotated game. This game is played by someone I know from school (oogiegork) and shows that it can be dangerous game if there is a king gambit played and this shows what can happen even if you don't take the pawn on f4!
422,12,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Like I said there is a king gambit.
423,12,2,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I personally think that you should not do this because moving a kingside pawn in a opening is dangerous even when you can take the pawn on f4 and defend badly on the next few moves. But these players are better than me so I cannot talk.
424,12,3,fxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4P3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Black thinks that white is offering a fair exchange.
425,12,4,fxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And so he takes the pawn on e5
426,12,5,Qh5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',However this has turned out that it was not a fair exchange after all! For not only he moved a kingside pawn he also captured a piece leaving a path where white can check black making it unable to castle for the rest of the game and take the pawn on e5 next move (fork).
427,12,6,Qxe5+,b'rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQ -',And not only white took the pawn on e5 he has got the black king on the run!

431,13,1,h3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White loses a tempo. O-O is the standard line.

But in fact the remarkable 4...Bc5 is quite playable leading to ferocious play after 5.Nxf7!? but White maybe gets a slight edge after 5.Bxf7ch.  The old move 4...Nxe4 (5.Nxe4 d5) is more advantageous for white.

Maybe You stands better after the exchange because You can doubling Your rooks on the d-file and place Your King on b6 and then the knight on e4 and the King on b6 enough defence for the push c5. - These are just plans. The opponent will move inbetween too but after Qe4 Qxe4 Nxe4 Rc1 is a must and then R7h8 and I think You have the better position.

I've been debating for a while how to annotate this game.  I think it shows a beautiful sacrifice and I thinks it's a pity that in retrospect it doesn't work.  I'm going to attempt to show the power of the sacrifice the power of it's complications and the strength of the compensation.  I also hope to show why it loses (though it wins the actual game) why it doesn't get quite enough.  Enjoy!

White's queen and knight may prove very powerful on the queenside but they seem cut out of the play at the moment.  Black in turn has two great knights and a great central pawn duo.  However he has not yet managed to connect rooks yet so black's play must be based around using his center and connecting his rooks.  White on the other hand wants to make the queenside the battle ground.  Also if white can restrain the coming flood his two bishop should prove excellent.  One other major feature of the position is white's pin of the a pawn to black's rook this will be nullified if black connects rooks.

a) The most direct reason for the sacrifice is to connect the black rooks now that the rooks are connected white will play ...axb4 (attacking white's queen with the now defended rook) followed by ...bxa3 again winning tempo the pawn will be adequately defended and the b2 bishop will be attacked.  This gives black a passed a pawn and he will soon get a passed e pawn as well with a timely d3.

b) By diverting the light squared bishop off the h1-a8 diagonal white wins control over the e4 square his knight or queen can use it to great effect.

There are also various tactical threats based on the squares white's pieces will soon find themselves but I'll explain that later.

Now to explain the reasons for failure.  As with all failed sacrifice the sacrificer doesn't get enough for the material.  In this case a bishop is a huge amount to give up.  Black gets two passed pawns but if white can survive then those two pawns will prove weak and difficult to defend especially when white has an extra piece.  The other potential problem is that white's pieces are almost completely sidelined and the following moves open up the game allowing white's pieces to have just enough coordination to defend."
530,17,16,axb4,b'r2r2k1/1p2qpp1/2n2n1p/8/QpPp1P2/PN2p1PB/1B2P2P/R4RK1 w - -',! The planned follow-up white's queen is attacked and black's pawn will soon be passed.

In hindsight it's very easy to criticise this move white gives up the exchange and allows his king to be brought into the open.  Why did he make this move?  The knight was terrifying on f2 and black's pieces seemed to be flooding forward.

What white should've played is the cool 26.Bf5! by keeping the exchange and attacking the rook white is fine here are some variations: 

a) The tactical 26... Rxb3 simply fails 27.Qxb3 Nd4 28.Qxe3 and black's attack has disipated with significantly less material.  The attempt 27... e2 also fails 28.Re1 Qxc5 29.Be3 where white does NOT have near enough.

b) The immediate 26... e2 also seems ill-prepared 27.Bxd3 Nxd3 28.Qxd3 e1=Q 29.Rxe1 Qxe1  30.Kg2 and it's very hard to imagine white has a piece worth in compensation.

c) Finally 26... Rd1 attempting to intensify pressure doesn't bring home the bacon 27.Rxd1 Nxd1 28.Qe2 and black is stymied again.

So this move WAS the losing blunder but it's an understandable one."

The previous games of Suba's that I've shown are excellent games but very clear he dominates his opponents.  He does in this one too but the sacrifice is far deeper (and more commital) than anything in the other games and that makes it far less likely to be accurate.  I hope you enjoyed this game.

599,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is an old game I played when I was still a 1st category player but it remains to this day one of my favourite (and best) games. I am posting it on Gameknot because it is a pretty typical Sicilian game where Black counterattack is triggered basically by White's inactivity and lack of consistency. It is also a good representation of my playing style from that time - I was then a counterattacker usually defending and waiting for the opponent to weaken his position before I charged in for the ""kill"". The Sicilian is simply perfect for this style of play."
600,22,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"Another important thing to mention is that in this game I felt that I was completely overmatched as the rating difference clearly shows. My opponent was a strong and experienced master candidate in good form while I started playing tournament chess in 1996. so I was still pretty inexperienced. My chances to ""survive"" were objectively minimal but I played with a sence of desperation determined not to go down without a fight. At that time I was literaly obsessed with development tempi (and still am I suppose) especially since I knew how important they are in such a sharp opening as the Sicilian. This factor will play a very big role in this game."
601,22,2,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This variation is what I exclusively play in rated games although I am now considering branching out to the Paulsen variation (1.e4 c5; 2.Nf3 e6; 3.d4 cd4; 4.Nd4 a6).

I never saw it before so after some thought I decided to ""take advantage from it"" and remove the d4 Knight as I usually did but without bringing the unpleasant Bd4 (after Be3) to the centre. This is actually not a bad decision but today I would also consider playing 6...e6 and allowing the English attack (Be3 Qd2 0-0-0 g4 etc.)."
603,22,4,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Usually I played e6 and developed the Bishop on e7 but I couldn't resist the potential later tempi on Qd4. Also I knew that in the Dragon variation the Queen has to be on d2 to support eventual Bh6 so I figured if he wants to play this way I will again gain a few tempi while he sets it up. So everything looked rather rosy at the moment. Objectively the game is equal.
604,22,5,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/4P3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',And here it is! Now I knew I achieved a small victory in the opening with smooth development and a clear plan (Be6 Rc8 Qa5). Correct moves are 10.e5 or 10.Bc4 with equal game (slightly more comfortable for White) but I guess White played pretty relaxed due to his heavy favourite status. At this moment I had spent 19 minutes from the clock he spent 4.
605,22,6,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/6B1/4P3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',Taking advantage from the fact that there is no opposition on the diagonal.

The answer is simple: every move Black made was a straightforward and active developing move except for 6...Nd4 - but that evened out with Qd4-Qd2 from White. On the other hand White additionally played defensive 11.Kb1 and his Bg5 Bishop is somewhat badly placed - it doesn't really pressure Black position (B:f6 would be a bad exchange) while it can't block Bg7 at all (if it was on e3 then Bd4 would be a possibility). All Black pieces are in aggressive positions and are ready to attack. So obviously White has to neutralize the pressure on his position before he starts to play actively. There were two ways to do this: 12.Be3 (another loss of tempi) or 12.Nb5 a6; 13.Nd4 - both variations with equal game and a comfortable/happy Black player. The last straw is that 12.g4 actually creates another weakness on g4 as it will soon become apparent.
609,22,10,1Rxc3,b'3q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/6B1/4P1P1/2r2P2/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R w - -',! I played this move after only 5 minutes of thinking but I was so excited that I couldn't make myself think any more :) actually this move is correct and the best available. The interesting thing is that after only 12 moves Black has a brutal attack on White's position without any obvious blunder on White's part. But a small loss of tempi (Qd4-Qd2) a misplaced piece (Bg5) a consolidating move (Kb1) and an untimely (unprepared) display of activity (g4) together have tipped the scale in Black's favour.
610,22,11,1Qxc3,b'3q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/6B1/4P1P1/2Q2P2/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R b - -',"13.bc3 Ne4!; 14.fe4 Qa5 is even worse. Black is a Rook down but all remaining pieces are concentrating unopposed fire on the queenside. White now started to play seriously but it is too late - the underdog Black had nothing to lose and has sensed the golden opportunity. The plan is clear and everthing ""goes with music""."

615,22,16,Qb4+,b'5rk1/pp2ppbp/3pb1p1/6B1/1q2P1P1/4Q3/2PK3P/3R1B1R w - -',Starts another series of forced checks which further strip the cover of the King.

After that 23.Qd2 Qe4 gets Rh1 and 23.Kd2 Bg4 creates horrible threat 24...Qb4. This can be prevented by a Queen move but then Bg5 is lost after Qc1. If 24.Bg4 then 24...Rc2; 25.Kd3 Qb3; 26.Kd4 e5#
621,22,22,2Kg3,b'2r3k1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5qB1/6b1/6K1/3Q3P/3BR3 b - -',26.Qf4 Qf4; 27.Bf4 Bd1; 28.Rd1 is similar to the game ending. Black has 6 (!) pawns for the Bishop.
622,22,23,Rc4,b'6k1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5qB1/2r5/6K1/3Q3P/3R4 w - -',Again the simplest move I could find bringing the Rook into the fight. By this time I spent 1:53 of my time leaving 7 minutes for 13 moves - which is plenty considering the position. My opponent played quickly most of his moves - they were more or less forced anyway.
623,22,24,f6,b'6k1/pp2p2p/3p1pp1/5qB1/2r5/6KP/3Q4/3R4 w - -',Defending e7 with tempi. Now I only wanted to exchange Queens and play out an easy ending.
624,22,25,Rc2,b'6k1/pp2p2p/3p1pp1/5q2/8/4B1KP/2rQ4/3R4 w - -',Now there is no Rg4 so this is the only good place for the Rook.
625,22,26,3Qd5+,b'6k1/pp2p2p/3p1pp1/3Q1q2/8/4B1KP/2r5/3R4 b - -',This pretty much resigns the game. 30.Qd4 is the only hope however slim it may be. I would probably start pushing the 2 queenside passers while trying to create mating threats on the kingside. Since the only open line is in Black's hands there is virtually no danger of getting mated suddenly.
626,22,27,Rc6,b'3B4/5k1p/p1rp1pp1/1p2p3/8/R5KP/8/8 w - -',1:57 on the clock and everything is defended. White did not resign yet though (and even managed to create a passed pawn!).
627,22,28,d5,b'8/7p/p1r1kpp1/Bp1pp3/7P/R5K1/8/8 w - -',The time control. After this both players received additional 30 minutes on the clock.

629,22,30,Ke6,b'8/7p/p3kppP/1p6/4r3/3R2K1/8/8 w - -',Now I decided to go and take out the h6 pawn before I do something really stupid and lose :)
630,22,31,5Kf2,b'8/3R3p/p4ppP/1p3k2/8/4r3/5K2/8 b - -',51.Kg2 is slightly better but the pawn is lost anyway after Kg5.
631,22,32,Rb3,b'8/8/1R3pp1/1p4k1/8/1r6/5K2/8 w - -',"White finally resigned. I hope you had fun watching the game. Learning points (I hope) are: 1. Never underestimate your opponent. This was really White's downfall. We played 2 more games within 3 years from this one and he outplayed me both times playing seriously and powerfully. 2. It is necessary to play with consistency and according to the reality of the position. 3. Tempi are everything in tactical positions! --- Thank you for looking over this game I can answer any questions on private.

A couple of weeks ago I was present when he was analyzing one of his games where he also had the black pieces and they had played the QGD symmetrical variation wich ended in a draw. But I had checked out the opening at home and found a small improvement for white so now it was a good opportunity to show it! Enjoy..."
748,28,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',At this point ofcourse I was wondering:''Will he play 2...c5?''. I remember the adrenaline pumping trough my body....
749,28,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Yes...ofcourse like I said the last game he played with this variation ended in a draw ( against the leading player in our group ) so why not try it again...
750,28,3,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The best move here.
751,28,4,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Going for the same line he played against Fung*. 
*( M. Fung was the leading player at the moment in our group with a current KNSB rating of 1816. The game I played against him ended in a quick draw.)
"
752,28,5,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',! Though not really worthy of an exclamation mark this move is my first improvement. Fung had played 4.Nc3 when the game continued with 4...Qxd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Nf3!) 5....cxd4 6.Nb5 Kd8 6.Nxd4
753,28,6,cxd4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3q4/3p4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The most common continuation.
754,28,7,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3q4/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is all known theory ofcourse. Black has two common responses 5...Qa5 and 5...Qd8. But allready white has won a tempo since the queen must retreat.
755,28,8,Qd8,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White has developed both knights while black has yet to develop a piece! 
756,28,9,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/3N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It's more common to take with the queen here but I decided I didn't want to swap queens going for sharp play and avoiding a draw.
757,28,10,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/3N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black has to start bringing his pieces into action.
758,28,11,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/6B1/3N4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Both sides developing their pieces...
759,28,12,1a3,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3N4/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Perhaps 11.Nf3 is slightly better here but I wanted to stop the c6-knight from jumping to b4 since I was planning to move my queen to c2.
760,28,13,Qb6,b'r3k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2pn2/6B1/3P4/P1NB4/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The queen attacks both pawns on b2 and d4.
761,28,14,Rc8,b'2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2pn2/6B1/3P4/P1NB4/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 w k -',Pinning the knight on c3.
762,28,15,1Rad1,b'2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2pn2/6B1/3P4/P1NB4/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',!? This pawn sacrifice is just too tempting. 
763,28,16,1Qxd4,b'2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/6B1/3q4/P1NB4/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',To say this is a blunder goes too far but I would have considered another move  here. Actually 14...h6!? is the best chance for black here; 15.Be3 O-O with a more or less equal position. 
764,28,17,1Bb5,b'2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/1B4B1/3q4/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',Now white has a clear edge because the black king is in a vulnerable position for example 15...Qg4 16.Bxd7  Nxd7 17.Bxe7 Kxe7.
765,28,18,1Qc5,b'2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/1Bq3B1/8/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',Ok...what now? I'm still a pawn down...
766,28,19,1Bxd7+,b'2r1k2r/pp1Bbppp/4pn2/2q3B1/8/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',? Computer analysis shows a better alternative here: 16.Bxf6 Bxb5 17.Bxg7 Bxf1 18.Bxh8 wich is winning for white. But hey my name is not Fritz so I came up with another plan...
767,28,20,1Nxd7,b'2r1k2r/pp1nbppp/4p3/2q3B1/8/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',The position  is now equal again.
768,28,21,1Qa4,b'2r1k2r/pp1nqppp/4p3/8/Q7/P1N5/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',The point. The queen attacks the pawn on a7 and simultaneously prevents black from castling since that would leave the knight 'en prise'. (For your information en prise is a French expression meaning that a piece is unprotected and may be captured.)
769,28,22,1a6,b'2r1k2r/1p1nqppp/p3p3/8/Q7/P1N5/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',?? 18...Rc6 was the only move here but black didn't want to give up his extra pawn.
770,28,23,1Nd5,b'2r1k2r/1p1nqppp/p3p3/3N4/Q7/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',! White now has an overwhelming position.
771,28,24,1b5,b'2r1k2r/3nqppp/p3p3/1p1N4/Q7/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w k b6',?? Black cracks under the pressure. Ofcourse the knight can't be taken because of 19...exd5 20.Rfe1
772,28,25,2Qxa6,b'2r1k2r/3nqppp/Q3p3/1p1N4/8/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',?? At this point I was so focused on taking back the pawn that I missed 20.Nxe7 bxa4 21.Nxc8 wich ofcourse leaves white with a decisive material advantage.
773,28,26,2Nc3,b'2r1k2r/3n1ppp/Q3p3/1pq5/8/P1N5/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',Attacking the pawn on b5.
774,28,27,2Ne4,b'1r2k2r/3n1ppp/Q3p3/1pq5/4N3/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',The white knight is quite strong in this game.
775,28,28,2Qb6,b'1r2k2r/3n1ppp/Qq2p3/1p6/4N3/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',Now an exchange of queens is inevitable.
776,28,29,Nxb6,b'1r2k2r/5ppp/1n2p3/1p6/4N3/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w k -',The position is again more or less equal now.
777,28,30,2Nd6+,b'1r2k2r/5ppp/1n1Np3/1p6/8/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b k -',Black's b-pawn is now lost but...
778,28,31,Nd5,b'1r5r/4kppp/4p3/1N1n4/8/P7/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',? A decisive mistake. 25...Na4!? 26.b3 Rxb5 27.bxa4 Ra5 would have probably led to a drawn game.
779,28,32,2b3,b'1rr5/4kppp/1n2p3/1N6/P7/1P6/5PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Now white has a better position again due to the pawns on the queenside.
780,28,33,3Kf1,b'1r6/5ppp/3Npk2/3n4/P7/1P6/2r2PPP/1R2RK2 b - -',!? Setting up a trap for black. 
781,28,34,Rxb3,b'8/5ppp/3Npk2/8/P7/1rn5/5PPP/2R2K2 w - -',?? The last couple of moves were played relatively fast but by this time we were playing for almost two and a half hours. Can you guess what white played next?
782,28,35,3Rxc3,b'8/5ppp/3Npk2/8/P7/1rR5/5PPP/5K2 b - -',"! Inspired by the name of our chessclub the white rook delivers a final blow! (34...Rxc3 35.Ne4 ). At this point black could have resigned but he decided to fight 'till the end. The rest of the game is probably not so important but I'll post it anyway..Hope you enjoyed!

787,28,40,4a6,b'8/6pp/P1N2k2/4p3/5p2/R2K4/1r3PPP/8 b - -',43...e4  is no trouble for white: 44.Kxe4 Re2  45.Kxf4.

881,33,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I'm a 1. d4 player. Always have been. Lately I've been studying the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems - and I ran across this game. I've never heard of this Sashin fellow but the name Korchnoi cetainly caught my eye. I have come of the opinion that the strong GM types consider the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems a little slow and boring (and most often drawish) but if it's good enough for Korchnoi it's good enough for me. Or so I thought......This is a wild game. Sashin plays solidly and delivers an extremely subtle but beautiful 23rd move which starts the fireworks. Korchnoi gets through the opening in solid position and then goes totally nuts with a brutal attack during the middlegame (at one point delivering 11 consecutive checks!) which marches the white king all the way across the board. Then just like THAT! - all of his initiative is gone and Sashin's awesome 23rd move gem tells the tale of victory. Was it brilliant insight into the position? or was it just dumb luck? I don't know....but this IS a pretty game! As always my meager analysis will be limited. I hope you enjoy:)
882,33,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',So far standard Nimzo Indian play. White is most likely interested in kingside play and black is looking to push on the queenside.

889,33,8,Bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1bB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black forgoes the bishop pair and continues to disrupt the queenside.
890,33,9,1Bxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',And the smoke clears a bit. Both sides have roughly equal control of the center. White has the bishop pair and better developing space but three pawn islands. Black is slightly weaker in development but has good pawn structure and quicker access to the half open c and d files.

His brilliant attacking sequence just ran out of gas. While 34...QxB does remove some heat from g7 it just can't deal with..........

Black resigned at this point as 35...Kf8 loses to 36. Rg8# and 35...Kh8 loses to 36. Rh7#. What a truly wonderful game! I have gone back and played through it several times and each time I am convinced that white is busted. I just know that Korchnoi has an irresistable attack. Then I just revel in Sashin's 23rd move and his dogged stubborness as he just waits for his chance to deliver his one and only shot at victory and succeeds. Man I love chess:) - Thomas

In this game he creates holes by sacrificing against black's lack of development and lack of space.  I recommend playing the game out on a board so that the variations can be analyzed.

A very strange move to make when black is two moves down in development has less space and spent the previous turn preparing to play ...Bb7.  A player like me probably wouldn't be able to exploit this as effectively but while black's knight is on d7 he's lost the bishop's control of e6 with black's pawns on h6 and g6 he's lost control of the light squares around his king.  While this game doesn't attack the light squares quite as thematically as Rublevsky game #1 attacked the dark squares this attack is based once again about the weaknesses in black's game.
