Not to mention that this doesn't develop.  It's also worth noting based on what Joe has mentioned and I agree with that TA can afford to not develop or play normal openings because he's a lot more experienced.  But if someone with less experience doesn't follow those guidelines it can get that said person into a lot of trouble.
105,3,6,h3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Likewise I don't know why Sandre played this.  As noted I would've castled.

107,3,8,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1PB1P3/P1NP1N1P/2P1QPP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq b3',Presumably Sandre is going for a pawn chain since he's not ready to bring his Bc1 into play yet.
108,3,9,1Qe3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/1PB1P3/P1NPQN1P/2P2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Once again I don't why Sandre played this.
109,3,10,1Ng5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/6N1/1PB1P3/P1NPQ2P/2P2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Bringing his N into what appears to be a better place.  So reposting the N.  I think it's a little late for that because of...
110,3,11,1e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/6N1/1PB1P3/P1NPQ2P/2P2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This move as now Joe starts developing.  The idea is waiting for the opponent to feel comfortable like this and then go for it by playing the standard developing moves.  What it boils down is that it's just a matter of time before he does that.
111,3,12,1Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/6N1/1PB1P3/P1NPQ2P/1BP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',As now Sandre completes his development.

113,3,14,1Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/4p3/8/1PB1P3/P1NPQN1P/1BP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Not to my surprise Sandre retreats to prevent that.
114,3,15,1d6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pp3/8/1PB1P3/P1NPQN1P/1BP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Although it blocks his Be7 I like this move.  My guess is that he's still giving Sandre a chance because of how confident white is.  Yes Joe is also known to this and it's something else that I like about him.
115,3,16,1a4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pp3/8/PPB1P3/2NPQN1P/1BP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Getting a semi open file.
116,3,17,1Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp1bppp/2npp3/8/PPB1P3/2NPQN1P/1BP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',"So Joe goes on the offense but ""For Real This Time"".  Not only won't that N retreat back again.  More importantly however is the fact Sandre's b4 is now attacked.  And when he defends Joe will continue developing with his other N.  Just like here he won't undevelop it this time around."
117,3,18,1Nd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2nppn2/8/PPBNP3/B1NPQ2P/2P2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Sandre wants to exchange but in my opinion it's a mistake.  And that's also based on what Susan Polgar mentioned exchanging the more active piece as this will benefit Joe.
118,3,19,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/PPBQP3/B1NP3P/2P2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',After which Joe castles.
119,3,20,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/PPBQP3/B1NP3P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',As does Sandre.
120,3,21,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/PPBQP3/B1NP3P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',But Sandre overlooked this move as his Bc4 is attacked which is a significant gain of tempo as we'll see when he takes.
121,3,22,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3P4/PPBQ4/B1NP3P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',And that's because of the fact that Joe does not take back.  With that being said it reminds of the same difficult chess problem that GM Judit Polgar once posted.  That's because white had a forced draw but the solution was giving up the Rook for free as now he had the time needed to force the stalemate.
122,3,23,2d6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2pPpn2/8/PPBQ4/B1NP3P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Giving that Sandre can't take lest he lost he gave up the Queen white advances to attack the Bishop.  I mean that pawn was a goner one way or another as we're about to see.  Not only that but he'll face some difficulty.  That's because when Joe takes he is going to threaten the win of material.
123,3,24,2Qe3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/PPB5/B1NPQ2P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Which Sandre had to prevent since Joe was threatening a skewer with 21...Be5.  If he played it now however white has 22.d4.
124,3,25,2Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3n4/PPB5/B1NPQ2P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',So Joe plays this instead to attack the Queen.
125,3,26,2Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3N4/PPB5/B2PQ2P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Which forces Sandra to take to avoid the loss of material.  However I would've played 22.Bxd5 because N's were exchanged but Susan Polgar in answer to that issue said that it's generally Knight for Bishop.
126,3,27,2Bb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/PP6/BB1PQ2P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Protecting his B since it was attacked.
127,3,28,2Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/PP6/BB1PQ2P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Attacking the Q whilst centralizing his R which is in general a good idea.
128,3,29,Qe7,b'r1b1r1k1/pp2qppp/2pb4/3p4/PP6/BB1P1Q1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Bringing his Q in front of the R which is also a good idea.
129,3,30,2Rfe1,b'r1b1r1k1/pp2qppp/2pb4/3p4/PP6/BB1P1Q1P/2P2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',?? This is in my opinion the losing blunder.  Up until now I think that Sandre was playing fine.  But this move however enables a mating net which Joe is going to take advantage of.
130,3,31,Rxe1#,b'r1b3k1/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/PP6/BB1P1Q1P/2P2PP1/4r1K1 w - -',The moral to this story is something that Jack Stockel taught me some time ago.  So it's more then just being overly confident which is also how and why I learn from Joe's games like this.  When it appears equal or you have an advantage then the question is does the position hold.  In other words can you keep that draw or initative.  And it's not just luck.  Instead you need to try your best and not make a mistake.  Otherwise you lose the edge and/or don't keep that draw.  In general that means that it changes from a win or draw to a loss.  That's what happened in this game as Sandre fought hard but made a mistake that overlooked this mating net.  From then on it was game over.
131,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',As white Bernard enjoys opening with 1.d4.
132,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Which I'm used to and his next move is the same.  I was interested in what would happen after 2...Nf6 since that's how I also answered last week.
133,4,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Unlike last time it has become the KID.  So we'll stick to mainlines for a while.
134,4,3,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/3P4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',But this is where he deviates.  That's because in the mainline white fianchettos with 6.b3 which is preceded by 7.Bb2 as I learned by Ken.  Nonetheless I'll take back and am interested in how Bernard answers.
135,4,4,Qb3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Bringing his Queen out early.  I don't why Bernard did this.  My guess is that he's starting to face distractions as well.  That's because my speculation is that maybe my opponent thought that he'd win a pawn with 8.Nxd5?? after which I win a N.  Later on I find out that he wasn't going to take but I still think that a distraction played a role.  However this move is not premature because there will be several threats affiliated with it when I get distracted and forget some things that Ken noted until it's too late.
136,4,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',But aside from distraction I don't care what the reason is.  As far as I was concerned he made an inaccuracy which I try to exploit by castling at once since Bernard has K safety to worry about.
137,4,6,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1QNBPN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',With that being said Bernard continues with his development.  
138,4,7,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/3p4/3P2b1/1QNBPN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',?? As do I.  But I decide to do things differently then average.  Given that he brought his Queen out prematurely I'm now threatening to destroy his pawn structures around the monarch.  With that being said I figured that I've gained tempo.  But I seriously miscalculated not to mention that the distraction has started for me.  As noted I didn't think twice about where that N would retreat.  The only move that came into consideration was 9.Ng5 after which I'd play 9...b6 to defend that pawn.  But with this move I'm forced to protect my N after which he knabs that pawn.  More importantly however is the fact that he'll win much more later on.   In fact I think that this is the losing blunder believe it or not because I didn't just miss the story but everything that the board was indicating as my concentration just wasn't there.  As it turns out what I thought was a waist of time happened to be the same threat.  Which I missed when deciding to calculate at once as opposed to considering other choices.  That's because as noted this was anything but a normal week at a chess club.  And I hope that it doesn't get this crazy.  But the point here is that there was more then one threat that needed to be considered.  Even worse is never mind threats I was back to only thinking about one as opposed to multiple variations which is something that Ken discussed in our game.  In doing so things that were essential didn't even come close to consideration with this game.
139,4,8,Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pQpn1pbp/4bnp1/3pN3/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Not only that but my R was threatened.  Which made this the only way to protect it.  But despite only being one pawn down my position is already starting to crumble with the terrible choice.  In addition the distractions are only going to get worse and the judgement with multiple threats isn't going to get any better here.  
140,4,9,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pQpn1pbp/2N1bnp1/3p4/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I knew that I had to get the N out but didn't think about this move.  Instead thought that the worst that happens is Bernard on exchanging on d7 with 11.Nxd7  Instead he's going to force me to exchange Queens which is something that I didn't want after being down what I am.  On top of it I figured that I might need my Q later on which I won't have now.  Then I thought ok we exchange Queens but aside from that the problem is over.  However it's only beginning as I also failed to calculate 13.Ne7+  After which he's going to win my R for a N.  This is actually why 8...Bg4+?? was a blunder.  And I didn't see any of this and thus missed the entire that the board was indicating because despite trying my hardest not to I became too distracted to concentrate as noted when the blunder occurred.  In doing so I also didn't think about and forgot what Ken said about calculating multiple variations.  Now it's basically too late to save the position.  I don't realize until later on.  But I'd call this a resignable position at this point.
141,4,10,Rfxc8,b'r1r3k1/p1pn1pbp/2N1bnp1/3p4/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',"Although it's not needed here what's worth noting is that I thought that this was the best that Bernard could do.  However this was where the variations ended for me.  But the next move took me off guard.  And what this means is based on how I was thinking with Ken as that I just wasn't thinking about the game.  I now know what I was thinking about.  In addition to that most of my concentration was spent worrying about Jack's wife and hoping she was allright rather then how the game was developing which is a ""no no"" as bhidragon pointed out."
142,4,11,1O-O,b'2r4k/p1pn1pbp/4bnp1/3p4/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',And this is where Bernard castles.  Earlier in the game I figured that he might have ruined his chance to castle by bringing the Q out early before figuring why he did it.  But I knew that he might be able to castle later on.  As I also learned (being that the Q was my favorite and one of the very few that I always follow) it didn't apply in this game because of the loss of material that I just dealt with.  Right after his played this the distraction was temporarely over.  However it'll return and were it permanent the position is still lost for me.  I can put a fight and there's definitely more to learn but in the end Bernard will end up with an overwhelming advantage as he's the equivalent to a piece ahead without compensation.
143,4,12,1c5,b'2r4k/p2n1pbp/4bnp1/2pp4/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - c6',Trying to get some counterplay though I'm interested in exchanging pawns.  I wasn't just hoping but also figured that I could get a dangerous passed pawn by knocking off his c pawn since it looks like d5 would be something to watch.  However this was a case of jumping the guns again since I forgot that d4 stopped it.  But it was still worth trying and putting up a fight since Bernard said that despite this position it was difficult for him to force the win.  And that was due to how strong I played when I was not distracted like now. 
144,4,13,Nxc5,b'2r4k/p4pbp/4bnp1/2np4/8/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I also took note of the fact that his Bd3 would be attacked.  Bernard also implied that this was another reason that it wasn't easy for him to win the game which makes me happy because it shows that when things are normal I do remember what Ken emphasized.  The problem is what to do in the future if I have a day like yesterday.
145,4,14,Rd8,b'3r3k/p4pbp/4bnp1/2np4/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',This is the main way in which Bernard had to struggle as I've placed my Rook behind what I thought was a passed pawn based on Susan Polgar's advise.  What I overlooked is his e3 and therefore was not a passer after all.  But I don't mind missing that as I'd still play this and treat it like a passed pawn regardless since that's what I'm used to (it blends in with my style of play).
146,4,15,1Rb1,b'3r3k/p4pbp/4bnp1/2np4/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/1RB2RK1 b - -',I don't know why he play this.
147,4,16,1Bf5,b'3r3k/p4pbp/5np1/2np1b2/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/1RB2RK1 w - -',And although the reasons should matter the distractions were starting up again so I didn't care.  My attitude was play a move that looks inaccurate and I'll punish it by attacking something.  So he moved the Rook without me knowing the logic and I wound attacking the Rook which forces him back to a1.  I feel that if I'm going to lose it won't be without me trying to pull a swindle.  And part of trying the combat is by gaining tempo and attacking pieces whenever possible.
148,4,17,Ne8,b'3rn2k/p4pbp/6p1/2np1b2/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Trying to reposition my N to a better spot.  The plan was 20...Nc7 followed by 21...Ne6 as I like better there then on f6 where it blocked my Bg7.
149,4,18,2Rd1,b'3rn2k/p4pbp/6p1/2np1b2/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',Centralizing his Rook.
150,4,19,2Bc2,b'3rn2k/p4pbp/6p1/2np4/8/2N1P3/PPb1BPPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',? But figuring that it was inaccurate so like before this was the only move that came into consideration.  And I'm now as distracted as that of earlier since Stanley has to leave at this point and therefore said goodbye to everyone at the club.  So I didn't consider any other move except for this.  However it's a mistake as I missed the next move which does more then just attack the Bishop since he is going win a pawn.  Better was the immediate 20...Nc7 which is why I played 19...Ne8 in the first place.
151,4,20,2Rxd5,b'3rn2k/p4pbp/6p1/2nR1b2/8/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R1B3K1 b - -',Not only that but I'm going to be forced into liquidating Rooks.  I didn't want this do to being behind.  But if I don't take he's going to win my Nc5 which I couldn't allow. And if I retreat he gets my Rd8 with this nasty fork.  So my next move is forced.
152,4,21,Be6,b'4n2k/p4pbp/4b1p1/2nN4/8/4P3/PP2BPPP/R1B3K1 w - -',But I figured (so the thought process) is at the very least I do gain tempo which made it appear worth it.  So it's still going to make things difficult for Bernard.  However that is not true because of what he does next.
153,4,22,Na4,b'4n2k/p4pbp/4b1p1/8/n4N2/4P3/PP2BPPP/R1B3K1 w - -',Unlike before despite being behind I'm ready to exchange pieces and act on it.  That was do to distraction and my thought process behind it was.  The reason behind this move was that I figured that I'd win a pawn back.  So no matter how hard he tried Bernard couldn't prevent me from getting a little compensation which I miscalculated.  That's because the only variation that came to mind was 25.Nxe6 fxe6 followed by 26...Bxb2 27.Bxb2 Nxb2 figuring that he had almost nothing left which in theory were it of equal strength could become a draw and boom I've made for some of the damage.  But with the remanants of what left of that distraction I missed what comes after that which was 28.Bxe8 so it's an example of needing to calculate multiple variations.  I say this because this is how I thought with Ken when I said if this then that happens.  And he said that I needed to think about more then one variation which didn't change with this game.  It was right after he took back on 28.Bxe8 that the distraction was over at once.  But by then it's a resignable position.
154,4,23,Nc4,b'4B2k/p6p/4p1p1/8/2n5/4P3/P4PPP/R5K1 w - -',Figuring that I was still only down by the equivalent to a piece and pawn but no more I still play on.  Had I known about being this far down I would've resigned.  That started to change thought on my very next move.
155,4,24,2Bf7,b'7k/p4B1p/4p1p1/8/2n5/4P3/P4PPP/R5K1 b - -',The reason being is that I calculated what had v. what he had.
156,4,25,2Nd6,b'7k/p4B1p/3np1p1/8/8/4P3/P4PPP/R5K1 w - -',So I displayed some Hope Chess because of this attack.  As I'm hoping but know that he won't retreat.  Instead he'll take with the Bishop so like with Ken it didn't work.
157,4,26,3Bxe6,b'7k/p6p/3nB1p1/8/8/4P3/P4PPP/R5K1 b - -',And I resigned here.  As now being this far behind on top of a pawn means that I'm not going to learn anymore.  Plus he will promote.  But more importantly though is the fact that I was too far behind.  In the second game which wasn't annotated since it started on the wrong side of the board I was not distracted at all and played much better.  On the other hand however Bernard was and had to run 30 minutes after the second one began.  So I didn't let the distraction bother me and with his mistake I won material.  Then I made a mistake which gave him back a piece.  However being low on time means that he made a another mistake and lost another piece which enabled me to win that game.  Therefore it was an interesting week.  What I hope happens in the future is that it stays normal or close to it.  In other words I'm praying that things don't get so crazy that there's one distraction after another as this is going to help me play better in the future.

237,7,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Fischer was known for his active style of play. He proved that the concept of universallism: in essence this means being strong and having the ability to connect positional and tactical play was needed to be most successful in this game. Being such an active player he preferred active not passive moves. 
238,7,1,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',?! - Here Fischer adopts a line not a lot of players use with today's theory. Even in his day this move at first look makes little sense at first glance. I mean choosing to push a pawn instead of continuing to develop the bishops? Seems like an amateur mistake to me. But never underestimate the mind of a genius such as Fischer. Think smarter not harder. What could Fischer possibly be planning?
239,7,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1np1n2/8/3NP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black naturally continues his development undeterred and unwary about what is going on in the mind of Fischer.

He is saying if you are going to delay your development and gain space then I will just play fast and exploit it. Here is a question I pose to you reader: how do you know if the beginning of an attack is just right or too soon? Perhaps you need to consider 2 factors: preparation and follow up. Why am I mentioning 2 obvious things here and now? Well let's look and see: black started advancing and attacking but overlooked a very important detail: the follow-up! It's a mistake you often see in games at the 2000+ level where positional chess becomes more of a deciding factor in games. But now you see why this attack failed. 
242,7,5,1g5,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p1P1/4P3/2NQ3P/PPP2P2/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',! - A great response. Now that white has the initiative time to apply some pressure of his own. Force that knight to move delay the castle but most importantly drive the opponent away.
243,7,6,1Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p4/2n1p1P1/4P3/2N1B2P/PPPQ1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Another good move deciding not to exchange but rather keeping the weakness of d6 on the board and forcing black to play behind it and deal with it somehow.
244,7,7,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pb3/2n1p1P1/4P3/2N1B2P/PPPQ1P2/2KR1B1R w - -',"So now that the opening phase is now complete (both sides are now castled) let's analyze the positions. I really like white's space acquired on the board the control he has and all the possibilities he has. Trouble may come when it comes to carrying out an attack as black can defend quite well but never underestimate the mind of a genius. Or as my mother puts it ""Where there is a will there is a way."" "
245,7,8,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pb3/2n1p1P1/4P3/2N1BP1P/PPPQ4/2KR1B1R b - -',Fischer remembers another edict of positional play: you are not just considering your own moves you are also thinking about your opponent's responses. As white can ill-afford to have an attack on the centre he adds another defender to his centre pawn (notice this isn't a piece defending it it is another pawn!). 
246,7,9,1Bh3,b'2rq1rk1/3nbppp/p2pb3/1p2p1P1/4P2P/2N1BP1B/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',What is Fischer doing now? Why is his attack so slow if his position is so good? He's a zen master as I said before he's biding his time weakening black's position even more. A problem that lower rated players have is that they rush the play and don't consider the build up. They do not consider the beauty of the build up. People like me on the other hand I was raised in an environment of chess. Tactics were nice but if the position was bad all the tactics in the world would do nothing to restore it. Just like times of war you have to have strategies to destroy an enemy not a strategy but strategies in case one fails. 
247,7,10,Nb6,b'2rq1rk1/4bppp/pn1p4/1p2p1P1/4P2P/2N1BP1R/PPPQ4/1K1R4 w - -',Black is now intending Nc4. Without looking forward be Bobby Fischer. What do you do?

249,7,12,2Nd5,b'2r2rk1/4bppp/pq1p4/1p1Np1P1/4P2P/5P1R/PPPQ4/1K1R4 b - -',Now we begin to see Fischer completely dominate his opponent. And his plans are beginning to take shape.

251,7,14,2Qf5,b'2r2rk1/3qbppp/p2p4/1p1N1QP1/4P2P/7R/PPP5/1K1R4 b - -',!! - Black is in serious trouble. He cannot take the queen or the game is over. And even with the defense black cannot mount any sort of counter attacks now.
252,7,15,Qd7,b'3r1rk1/3qbp1p/p2p2p1/1p1N2P1/4P1QP/2R5/PPP5/1K1R4 w - -',Here is a critical position. Black is clearly not giving up without a fight.

256,7,19,3a3,b'4rrkq/2R1bp1p/p2p2p1/1p1R2P1/4PN1P/P4Q2/1PP5/1K6 b - -',Now that Fischer has the exact position that he wants the king cannot move anywhere and the other pieces are pretty much stationary he is taking other minute threats away from his opponent so they don't become major problems.
257,7,20,3h6,b'4rrkq/2R1bp2/p2p2pp/1p1R2P1/4PN1P/P4Q2/1PP5/1K6 w - -',Desperate Black is trying anything to open the position to get some breathing room.

259,7,22,3Qb3,b'4rrk1/2R5/p2p2pq/1p1R2b1/4PN2/PQ6/1PP5/1K6 b - -',The position has opened but the king is just sitting there. This is not looking good for black.
260,7,23,3Rxf4,b'4r1k1/2R5/p2p2pq/1p1R2b1/4Pr2/PQ6/1PP5/1K6 w - -',The game is virtually over. Black has now walked into a mating net.
261,7,24,4Qxd8#,b'3Q1k2/2R5/p2p2pq/1p6/4Pr2/P7/1PP5/1K6 b - -',A wonderful game from the mind of a genius. If there is one take away even if you don't want to ever play a positional game just remember making tactical plans in chess still requires preparation and follow through.
262,8,0,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',one of the most dangerous setups against the Sicilian. White is very clear about his intent to over run black on the king side with a quick g2-g4-g5. 
263,8,1,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',developing the bishop and supporting the g2-g4 push. This also prevents black from playing Nh5-Nf4 which you see occurring in many Sicilian games. 
264,8,2,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',The a solid but semi passive approach that develops the bishop and prepares to castle king side. Which in my opinion is risky because white's whole game is on the king side so often if black does not play accurate can get crushed very quickly. If I were playing this game I would have opted for the alternative 7. ...Qc7 with the plan of mobilizing the queen side as quickly as possible and planting a knight on c5. For example 7...Qc7 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 h6 is relatively unexplored territory. Which is kinda weird for the Sicilian. 
265,8,3,f4,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq f3',"a very active move that takes advantage of the fact that black is playing somewhat passive. Furthermore there is some major dangers for black in ignoring his queen side development. Especially since the most common way for black to handle white's king side attack is to create a strong attack on the queen side. When playing the Sicilian one must take on the attitude of the boxer. When your opponent punches right you punch left. So sitting back and playing ""sound positional"" chess usually lands you in hot water. For me the warning signals are already going off for black here because g4 is coming and black has virtually no counter play against it.   "
266,8,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Standard move but castles into the up coming storm. However the alternatives are slightly less successful in practice. They are ...Qc7 and ...Nc6. Perhaps this speaks volumes about this whole 7...Be7 line for black. 
267,8,5,g4,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPPP1/2N1B3/PPP1B2P/R2QK2R b KQ g3',White is almost completely developed compared to black whose whole queen side is still on the bench.  
268,8,6,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p3pn2/3p4/3NPPP1/2N1B3/PPP1B2P/R2QK2R w KQ -',The best way to deal with a wing attack is to counter in the center. The only issue I have about this move for black is that it deflects a key defender away from the king and gives almost no hope for a win. Black is essentially playing for a draw. 
269,8,7,1g5,b'rnbq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p3p3/3pP1P1/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP1B2P/R2QK2R b KQ -',white keeps up with the pressure and methodically continues with his plan. Still unless white can manage to create a chink in black's armor there is no winning formula. 
270,8,8,1Qc7,b'rnb2rk1/1pqnbppp/p3p3/3pP1P1/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP1B2P/R2QK2R w KQ -',developing the queen but I think the more active 11...b5 is preferable. At very least black has a chance to create some much needed activity on the queen side with for example 11. ...b5 12. a3 Bb7 13. 0-0 Nb6+=
271,8,9,1Bd3,b'rnb2rk1/1pqnbppp/p3p3/3pP1P1/3N1P2/2NBB3/PPP4P/R2QK2R b KQ -',This sets up brilliant tactic on h7 in combination with Qh5. 
272,8,10,1Nc5,b'rnb2rk1/1pq1bppp/p3p3/2npP1P1/3N1P2/2NBB3/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ -',Hum at first glance this looks like a good move. But White's follow up refutes this as it exploits black's king safety issue. I have to admit that it is very hard to provide an improvement to this move. However based upon the results of this game and my over the board analysis perhaps black can hope for 12. ...Rd8 13. Qh5 g6 14. Qg4 Bb4 15. h4 Bxc3 16. bxf3 Qxf3+ 17. Ke2 being unclear. But the main point of 12...Rd8 is that it allows the d7-knight to go to f8 defending the king side. In such situations the knight is a much better defender than the rook. 
273,8,11,1Qh5+,b'rnb2r2/1pq1bppk/p3p3/2npP1PQ/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP4P/R3K2R b KQ -',White gives up the bishop for a very powerful initiative and advantage on the king side.

275,8,13,Ne4,b'rnb2rk1/1pq1bpp1/p3p3/3pP1PQ/3NnP2/2N1B3/PPP4P/2KR3R w - -',The oh no moment for black as I am sure he realized that 15...g6 fails to the 16. Qg4 and 17. h4 combination. This move leads to a clear advantage for white. Best in my opinion is to allow white to try his luck on the king side via. 15...Rd8( takes real ball to play this) 16. g6 fxg6 17. Qxg6 Bf8 aiming for the queen exchange later on. As exchanging the queens would reduce white's chances of a win. 
276,8,14,1Rhg1,b'rnb2rk1/1pq1bpp1/p3p3/4P1PQ/3NpP2/4B3/PPP4P/2KR2R1 b - -',now black is forced to play ...g6 with major holes on the king side and no real defenders are in sight.

278,8,16,1Rd8,b'rnbr2k1/1pq1bp2/p3p1p1/4P1P1/3NpP1Q/4B3/PPP4P/2KR2R1 w - -',black has to move his rook to give the king an escape route

White just simply was able to take advantage of a couple slight oversights that lesser mortals would have gotten away with. The most telling feature of this game was the issue of king safety as black through out the game did very little to slow the white advance on the king side. While at the same time doing little to create counter chances on the queen side. This necessarily does not mean black should loss but it does mean that his life is made much harder if he ignores whites' king side overtures. It is telling that for most of the game black's queen side forces remained undeveloped. Finally it is difficult to pin point the exact point where black went astray but maybe the line 7. ...Be7 needs to be reexamined in favor of 7...Qc7 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 h6. Another possible improvement may come on move 12 where black played 12. Nc5 going for activity but ultimately taking a key king side defender away from where it is needed the most. This is why I suggest 12...Rd8 allowing the d7-knight to come back to the defense of the king quickly via f8.      
283,9,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A flexible opening move that can transpose to a c4 or d4 opening.  I started playing this move more frequently recently simply to avoid e5 in response to c4--the so-called Reverse Sicilian by black.
284,9,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"The ""Mustang Defense"".  Certainly a playable move but Nc6 here seems to me to not be the most flexible move order depending on what white does.  By blocking his c-pawn black has limited many of his options and might be forced to waste time moving the knight again in order to get in c5 which can be a key break for black in many c4 or d4 openings.  Also after 2. e4 black is more or less committed to playing 2...e5 again limiting his options."
285,9,2,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbpp1/2n1pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K -',This seemed a bit awkward to me.  Black seems to be getting a little tied up and I looked hard for a way to perhaps take advantage of it.  It turns out that I could initiate a series of exchanges which highlighted the weaknesses of both Nc6 (meaning the immobilization of the c-pawn) and the bishop sitting on d7.
286,9,3,1Qh5,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1pp1/2n4p/3p3Q/3P3N/4P3/PP3PPP/2R1KB1R b K -',The point.  Other black recaptures in the previous sequence of exchanges would have likely led to the loss of the c-pawn so black was just tied up and uncoordinated in any event.
287,9,4,Nxd4,b'r4rk1/ppQ2pp1/7p/6q1/3n4/4P3/PP3PPP/2R1KB1R w K -',I'm not sure if this was a blunder due to an oversight (i.e. failing to see that when the knight moves my queen is now protecting the rook from an attack by his queen) or if my opponent indeed saw that this lost a knight but improperly evaluated the position after 16...Rac8 which does mean I have to give up my queen but clearly leaves me with significant compensation in fact a winning material advantage.  The rest of the game was essentially just converting the material advantage and being sure to not blunder with a back rank mate a perpetual or a stalemate somehow.

First I'm treating this as though I was playing against the Colle's System in which this is better.  Second like with that defense in the Colle's System K side fianchetto's in my books are unwise.  My idea now is to not play the wrong move so early as that's how I wind up in trouble.  The idea being is that the position would detoriate which I'm not ready for yet.

I am keeping in mind what Ken said about not exchanging for the thrills of it.  But I decide to do it anyway.  However it's not because I can (which has been done before the training.)  The real reason behind taking is due to in my opinion Loyd leaving himself with a weakness by playing 2...Nc6 before advancing the c pawn.  So I was trying to take advantage of that weakness which you want to do in chess.  That's because I view that N as worth more then my B since I think I know what it's capable.  By taking it my thought process is that black will wind up in trouble.

At this point I'm getting more and more confident since what I considered to be his strongest minor piece is a goner.

This time it is due to what Ken told me as I'm not ready to exchange now.  I will be however on the next move.  But I'll let him as TA calls it ""draw first blood""  In this context I'll let him take first before I do anything.  That's because exchanging right now will lose tempo since my Nf3 will be attacked.  By delaying this won't happen and then I'll try to exploit what I assume to be an advantage.  In other words I'll try to keep it."

That's attacking the Bishop so that when he retreats I can get rid of his weakest pawn by exchanging.  As now not only am I more comfortable but I'm happy with my position.  In fact I believe that I'm nearing a forced win but will not underestimate him as I don't know what he capable.  Sure enough I am wrong but it doesn't come until much later on.  However if I attempted to be 100% sure of myself the loss would occur much more quickly.

In this case my idea of a good time is 15...Bxe5 16.Rxe5 with the plan being 17.Qg5 and then doubling up where I'll have attacking forces (which could be overwhelming) against his monarch.

But this is where I start becoming overly confident as I overlooked his next move which happens to be a skewer.  Consequently this is going to lose material and give Loyd a near winning advantage which I don't realize until much later on.

The variations I calculated where winning the Queen for Rook or mating him.  It's complicated to explain those variations but they involved a lot of Homework.  I'm not surprised that he stopped them but when it's gone once and for all that's when I start realizing my fate on how the bad the position is.
366,11,22,2Rg3,b'r4rk1/1bp1q1pp/p1p1p3/3pN3/3P4/1P4R1/PBPQ1PPP/6K1 b - -',As now I'm planning to win back a pawn.
367,11,23,2Qh6,b'r4rk1/1bp1q1pp/p3p2Q/2ppN3/3P4/1P4R1/PBP2PPP/6K1 b - -',So this is where I try to follow up since the plan involves 22.Rxg7+ Qxg7 23.Qxg7+ Kxg7  And what I'm keeping in mind is that Loyd cannot capture with his g7 since it's pinned.  I remember doing something like this against Ted after seeing how bhidragon did it with me.  Not surprisingly however it won't work.  But my idea of a good time is putting pressure on him which happened because in the end Loyd said that he for a while didn't know what to do.  He figured it out but with great difficulty which is as Ken mentioned what pressure is all about.
368,11,24,2Qf6,b'r4rk1/1bp3pp/p3pq1Q/2ppN3/3P4/1P4R1/PBP2PPP/6K1 w - -',Not to my surprise Loyd stops that with this move.  So I try to come up with another plan.  One thing I kept in mind is that he wants to liquidates Queen.  The problem is that I'm actually in worse trouble then you could imagine.  That's because the only way to save the position is liquidating Queens.  But then I'd redeem it as resignable since there is nothing else to learn when you're down R for B and have exchanged the most powerful piece on the board.
369,11,25,2Qh3,b'r4rk1/1bp3pp/p3pq2/2ppN3/3P4/1P4RQ/PBP2PPP/6K1 b - -',?? Thinking that I still had a good fight left this was played to avoid the liquidation.  But the only way to keep this game alive would've been liquidating with 22.Qxf4.  It turns out that this loses immediately because of...
370,11,26,2Qxf2+,b'r4rk1/1bp3pp/p3p3/2ppN3/3P4/1P4RQ/PBP2qPP/6K1 w - -',This move as now 23.Kh1 is forced and then comes 23...Qf1# which is mate.  When the game was over Loyd and I analyzed this.  According to him 22.Qh3 was my only mistake since I had a strong position with his pieces tied down where he was struggling to find an answer with my forces against his monarch.  That's how I also concluded that he felt the pressure after 21.Qh6.  But he rightly pointed out that sometimes it only takes one mistake to lose the game which Jack Stockel agreed with.  In fact Jack made note of that while annotating Tom's game against a master (which Tom almost won but made one mistake and lost.)  I however disagree that 22.Qh3?? was the only blunder.  It lost quicker but I was in rough shape right after allowing the skewer with 16.Re3?? because black was either going to win my Rook or my Queen.  Afterwhich I was not going to have compensation and despite some counterplay the position was only going to go downhill white until I was in that situation where liquidation was needed to prevent mate.  Not only that but had I known that 22.Qxf6 was needed resignation would've been imminent for me.  In other words I would've resigned right then and there. 
371,12,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is playable though not recommended at our levels.  That's because a certain someone as well as Jack Stockel and tactical-abyss said that 1.Nf3 is normal.  But at our ratings it shouldn't be the first move since it's more difficult to control the center.  However you often see with the much more (2000+) rated players.  I do make note of it later.
372,12,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not to use to seeing that move I play this as though it were a Reti Defense since it starts off with 1.e4 Nc3.

It's not an inaccuracy at all. But my advice isn't to play it yet. Yes 1.Nf3 is a solid opening but in general more experienced players open with that. Before reaching a 1300 I was told to hold off on playing 1.Nf3.
378,12,7,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Mike: The one who showed it to me is a 2300. We play it well in blitzgames. I mess up in the eND game.  Joe: As you saw with our last game endgames are very difficult.  They must be played accurately because one mistake in that stage will often make or break the game.

I was thinking about what he might do with his DSB and figured out that he was going to pin my Nf6.  I asked myself if I should allow that pin or try to prevent.  In the end I decided to allow it since it's not serious given that I can break with ...Be7  As my idea of a good time is getting the King to safety at once.

Since similar to my first game against elyhim and the game against Ken being that I'm not used to this opening I decide to experiment as per reversion's advice when he told me to try different openings.  I also kept in mind that it didn't cost any more time to play this then advancing the d pawn.  If I did I would've considered this an inaccuracy and thus wouldn't play it.  But I don't see anything wrong with it when tempo isn't an issue.

I almost felt like telling him that it was an inaccuracy but wasn't sure in this position.  As I saw no way to gain tempo or make the N worthless so I don't say anything.  It's per archduke_piccolo's advice because he told me that if you can't prove it be inaccurate you shouldn't say anything.  I agree with that because were I to correct it and it turned out to be wrong then I'd wind up giving my students incorrect information which is a pet hate of mine.
383,12,12,Be7,b'r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1pn2n2/4p1B1/7N/2NP2P1/PPP1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Feeling however that it might be inaccurate but not wanting to take chances I decided to break that pin at once.  I also asked myself if Mike might be having multiple threats with our last move since I'm starting to feel the same way that I did with Kenneth_fiore_3 which is pressure.  My opinion is that he might be coming up with threats.  If so I was determined to stop it before that started.
384,12,13,e4,b'r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1pn2n2/4p1B1/4P2N/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - e3',Opening up the other center pawn which gives him control of the center.  I also think that Mike intended to stop e5 from advancing which wasn't going to happen.  I analyzed a variation that I thought might fail and now I'm glad that I'm thinking this way because of what Ken taught Sue in their first training session. I was originally thinking that if 8...e4 9.dxe4 Nxe4  But then I thought about what Ken told because that was only one variation so I looked at two.  Which was oh yes but then something else happened that would win a pawn because of 10.Nxe4  But now that I thought this way I've got to look at something even bigger and it was based on that game because I missed something even bigger which is similar to the mistake that I made against superandy.  And that was the loss of my Q for a B because Mike wouldn't have played 10.Nxe4 when he has the immediate 10.Bxd8 which would've come close to me resigning.

387,12,16,1Qg4,b'r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p6/3np1B1/3nP1QN/3P2P1/PPP2PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Joe: ?? This is your first blunder as white now winds up a piece down. Therefore best would've been to exchange with 11.Bxe7 and after 11...Qxe7 comes 12.exd5 where it remains even because I cannot then recapture with 12...Bxd5?? due to your Bg2 which would allow 13.Bxd5 losing a piece for pawn. So black wouldn't have got anything for that. But by playing this that changes.

In fact I thought about that more and it sounds like you felt pressure and weren't sure what to do which is some of what chess is about. But it caused you to get nervous when I played 10...Nxd5 My advice based on what Jack said is ""Don't get nervous."" Instead my model is to think of that pressure as an obstacle which then becomes a figuring out a way around and overcoming that obstacle.  It's also worth that because he's two pieces down I will take advantage by forcing some liquidation."
390,12,19,1Rxa1,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p6/3PpNb1/6Q1/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R5K1 b - -',Mike: I often go with my first instinct. The pressure seems to cause me to doubt and that makes it worse. Consider I have PTSD; triggers of being told not to doubt myself because it's not the right attitude  Life sucks. Chess helps me figure things out (somehow). Perhaps it has to do with algorithms  I just got pressured in another game. I thought about the best move. I doubted it at first and felt like crap  Joe: I was going to mention it as I know how you feel. In fact what you mentioned has been a general problem for me. It's called going by instincts are acting on impulse. That is something however that you don't want to do. So you're in a situation and ask yourself what to do. When not knowing how to handle you just go by what the instincts tell you. The bad part is that it can be very costly. For example in our last training game I played two fianchettos against the KID which got me into trouble as kenneth_fiore_3 mentioned. A better example was something that happened in a game where I played against the Colle's System which boiled down to most common problem of not controlling the impulse to move which led to rushing followed by my downfall. My advice is that when you want to play something think about it and see if it really works. And ask yourself what can get in the way of that move as that's how you'll determine if it'll work or not. And chess is helpful in life. So figuring things out in the real world is what motivated to want to become a better player which I later use that time to coach and mentor players like you as you can use some of that stuff outside of chess. And as for the last paragraph as this happened to me sometime ago which was later annotated don't let a different game affect you. Yes we all make mistake and the idea is to learn from them. But don't get so upset with yourself that it affects another game. A way to remember is that every game is different. This is also helpful in life because one time I was distracted at work due to a blunder I made in a chess game. So the idea is to think about what you've learned and how to prevent that mistake. It is however not a good idea to let it get to you though.
391,12,20,1g6,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1p1p/1p4p1/3PpNb1/6Q1/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R5K1 w - -',I looked at everything.  Despite not having threats against my monarch this was played to force further liquidation at the very least.  But Mike made a mistake that's going to lose yet another piece.

One could handle so much pressure (for those in my caliber). I feel that in the pre-end game that I caculate where these patterns are going. It totally takes me away from the fun of it.  I put you in check so that I coud take your bishop that seems to be a free piece  Oops. I just noticed it's not free   Joe:  Yes I was going to say that. What you were thinking is allright I'll play this because that check would force me to move the King which would lose a piece. A different student of mine had that problem. But unless the move is forced it's not if I do this he or she must do that. Instead it's about asking what your opponent can do. And then it boils down to what you might be missing. In this case I can take the N. So the lesson is to think about how that opponent is going to respond and really analyze. Not just analyze the board but going deeper is there might be things underneath that are more important. With that being said best was either 15.Nh4 or 15.Ne3 after which you exchange the N for B. It is liquidation nonetheless but it's better then losing another piece. Another example happened in my game against Jack Stockel. I made a move in which I thought I'd win his N with no way to protect in any variation. I overlooked one move that not only protected the N but won as now my King was exposed when he protected which enabled a quick mate.  I also agree that chess involves psychology and it's good to calculate. But similar to here it's also important to be aware of the immediate threats.
393,12,22,1Qh3,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1p1p/1p4pb/3Pp3/8/3P2PQ/PP3PBP/R5K1 b - -',Mike: Moved the queen to an open file.  Joe: Which is generally a good idea.  What I think to be truthful is that he should resign as there's pretty much nothing to learn.  But I wasn't going to tell him that because my belief is not making my students feel rushed or uncomfortable.  I was worried that telling Mike to resign would do that.  So I'm hoping instead that my student is ready and decides to resign which is going to happen but much later.
394,12,23,1Bg7,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1pbp/1p4p1/3Pp3/8/3P2PQ/PP3PBP/R5K1 w - -',One other thing is that I play with honesty which is similar to what Ken also believes.  And that's not giving the student a chance to get anything back.  Once in a while I've made that mistake which on two occasions resulted in the student getting back his advantage despite failing to win.  Out of those two times I took a break from teaching chess for about a month to get more experience from Jack Stockel.  So I'm not happy when it happens because I feel that it's still bad for learning.  Plus I also view as the equivalent to giving them the wrong information which as noted is something that I try to avoid.

As noted in one of TA's games part of keeping that advantage is not underestimating your opponent.  So I'm also not taking chances here.  One of the reasons I think Mike by trying to get a passed pawn is due to his d5 being protect by his Bg2.

Joe: But this move enables me to liquidate Queens which is the goal. Better would've been to retreat it.  Mike: Again that was my first instinct. Been getting some practice at the street chess thing.  Both Queens are protected.  After this however the chat stops.  And I don't say anything else because archduke_piccolo told me not to be too critical when one has a forced win.  I agree with that because I don't want the student to feel uncomfortable.  In other words I don't want their learning to be a bad experience.

403,12,32,2e5,b'r4rk1/p1p2p1p/bp1p2p1/3PP3/8/5BPP/Pb3P2/3R2K1 b - -',? I don't know why he played this but it's another mistake as it'll lose a pawn.  In addition although not right away this is going to guarantee a passed pawn as we will see.

408,12,37,2axb5,b'2r2rk1/pbp2p1p/2Rp2p1/1P1Pb3/8/5BPP/5P2/6K1 b - -',?? I said that because this move is a blunder that enables me to get a Rook for B.  But there are no good moves left which is why Mike should've resigned.  Yet I didn't know how to tell him that without him feeling rushed.  I think the only one who knows how to say that is reversion since he explained in such a way that didn't make me feel rushed.
409,12,38,Rcb8,b'1r3rk1/p1p2p1p/2Pp2p1/1P2b3/8/5BPP/5P2/6K1 w - -',So I attack his pawn.

Similar to how he gives what some call ""Queen odds"" I give Mike the Rook for my Bishop.  His Be2 was the only thing that was stopping my a pawn from promoting.  So by letting him have my Rook for B it is going to promote.  And that's something that Joe was also teaching which just because he gave something up or let his opponent get something back doesn't mean that he's going to lose.  And I had a somewhat similar exercise with GM Judit Polgar because there was a HW question based on a dream she has where JP gives up her Q.  And when the opponent takes it's mate.  Well no mate yet but it's very similar.  For once he takes the Rook and I take his Bishop my passed pawn will be killer."
413,12,42,axb5,b'5rk1/2p2p1p/2Pp2p1/1p2b3/8/6PP/5PK1/8 w - -',And this is where Mike is ready to resign.  He knows that I'll promote and when that happens it's mate.  Right after that I gave him the moral to this game which is something that he told me about and we discussed earlier.  So what I said was the moral to that game is to not act on impulse. Instead you want to take your time and when not sure ask yourself and analyze all of the possibilities. This is going to help you become a better chess player. 
414,13,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',In this the third of our 'coaching' games I relayed my thought processes - in fairly general terms - in the chat column.  It is a pity I didn't preserve them in some way.  Neither side played very accurately - but I think there is plenty of interest here.
415,13,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Dutch Defence.  Whenever I play this I have the Stonewall in mind.  Very occasionally though I follow with the Leningrad Dutch instead.
416,13,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Theory holds this as one of White's best - certainly a very popular - responses to the Dutch Defence.  For all its solid defensive appellation and appearance the Stonewall is in fact quite an aggressive line as is the Dutch overall.  That f-pawn move rather says to White: 'I going toe to toe with you so watch it!'  White builds as strong a defence as she can on the K-side.
417,13,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Normally I play 2...e6 but this knight development is equally good.  It is just transposing moves.

419,13,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',Definitely aiming for the Stonewall formation of pawns at f5 d5 and e6 c6.  It is a very solid and strong centre formation.  There are several of downsides though. One is that the dark squares especially e5 can be infiltrated by White.  Another is that Black's light-square bishop can become something of a problem child - what to do with it?  Yet the line was good enough for GM M. Botvinnik to adopt it in World Championship match games.  Indeed both players tried it at least once each the Botvinnik-Bronstein match of 1951.
420,13,6,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Interrupting the programme in favour of development.  The move 5...c6 would have been thematic and fine but the move played is still 'book'.  Incidentally when playing the Stonewall I much prefer if I can to develop the bishop at d6 rather than e7.
421,13,7,c3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Rather conservative I thought.  The move is solid enough and quite safe but the drawback (it seems to me) is that subsequently White will have trouble formulating a plan.  I was expecting 6.c4 here to which I was planning to reply 6...c6.  This would have opened a nice retreat square for the bishop after a possible 7.c5!?
422,13,8,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',At this point the Gameknot Engine (GKE) assesses the game at B0.21 (The B infront of the number indicates a Black edge).  But any margin less than W/B0.50 is really too close to call and denotes an equal game.
423,13,9,Nbd2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Had White played c4 the previous miove this knight could have been developed at c3.  Would that have been a more active location?  Possibly not.  By this move White opens up the possibility of moving the f3-knight to e5 and following with the other knight to f3.  That is quite a thematic motif in play against the Stonewall but it is no simple matter to arrange.  Black might for example choose to exchange on e5 with a knight at d7 or even the d6-bishop.
424,13,10,Bd7,b'rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Blocks the knight which may not have been the smartest option.  I was planning to bring the bishop back to e8 after which it might find useful employment at h5 or g6.  The GKE now calls the game so nearly equal it makes no difference: W0.03.
425,13,11,Ne1,b'rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 b - -',This retreat might look unnecessary and timid but it harbours (or ought to do) some nasty intent.  I really did expect that White intended to follow with 9.f4.  That had a big influence on my reply.
426,13,12,g5,b'rn1q1rk1/pppb3p/3bpn2/3p1pp1/3P4/2P3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 w - g6',[!?] GKE calls this an inaccuracy offering the following line: 8‚Ä¶ g5 9. Ndf3 h6 10. Ne5 Nc6 11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. Nd3 ...  But as its assessment is just W0.27 (from B0.30 the previous move) there really isn't a lot in it.  I accepted the line was probably too aggressive too early but I was prepared to take the risk.  As it happens White probably had a better move than 9.f4 in mind but rather to bring the knights to d3 and f3 training them against e5.  That would have been a very good plan and well executed too: 8...Nc6 9. Nd3 Qe8 10. Nf3 Ne4 11. Be3 Qh5 12. Nc5 Bxc5 13. dxc5 g5 14. Qc2 f4 15. gxf4 gxf4 (GKE).  But this line looks fine for Black in my view.
427,13,13,c4,b'rn1q1rk1/pppb3p/3bpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 b - -',Possibly better would have been 9.Ndf3 as suggested by the GKE and let this pawn push wait upon activating the White pieces.
428,13,14,c6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b3p/2pbpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 w - -',Black was not interested in exchanging pawns on c4 which would have been very pleasing for White.  Instead I invite 10.c5 Bc7.  White doesn't bite. All the same the GKE mislikes this and suggests White would have done well to follow up with 10.c5: ...Bc7 11. Nd3 g4 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Ne4 16. Qd4 b6 17. cxb6 axb6.  It prefers ...Nc6 but if then 10.c5!? Be7 leaves the bishop on a less active diagonal.  Having said all that neither line led to a definable edge to either side the assessment still being well within the W/B0.50 range.
429,13,15,1Nc2,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b3p/2pbpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This bespeaks possibly too defensive an attitude of mind.  Much better was 10.Nd3 prodding that tender point e5.  True Black would have repsonded with 10...g4 stopping the other knight reaching f3 but then White could have begun preparations for Queen side operations.  GKE offers this: 10. Nd3 g4 11. c5 Bc7 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Ne4 15. Nxd7 Qxd7 16. f3 gxf3 17. exf3 which looks pretty good for White.
430,13,16,1h5,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pbpn2/3p1ppp/2PP4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - h6',Really announcing my intention to attack all out on the King side.  This is actually fairly risky as Black can point to no real advantage to justify this.  Nor is the centre fully closed.  I am rather trusting that the centre is sufficiently locked up that it won't explode under some counter action by White in that part of the board.  The alternative 10...Na6 never crossed my mind at all and I doubt I would have played it if it had.  I think I might have chosen 10...Be8 instead.
431,13,17,exd5,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb1n2/3p1ppp/3P4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',For the first time the GKE gives the advantage .... to White!  I admit that in normal circumstances I would have chosen to recapture with the c-pawn with an even game.  But I wanted to keep the g2-bishop's long diagonal closed up as much as possible and open up the c8-h3 diagonal for my own light-square bishop (LSB c.f. DSB).  The main risk lies in the slight loosening of the centre which can only favour White.
432,13,18,1Nf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb1n2/3p1ppp/3P4/5NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',By attacking the g5-pawn in this way White maintains a slight edge.
433,13,19,1Ne4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb4/3p1ppp/3Pn3/5NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Possibly safer would have been 12...Nh7 but I wasn't interested in 'playing safe'.   But it was not going to be easy maintaining the knight at this outpost.  The Queen's knight is far too distant.
434,13,20,1Ne5,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb4/3pNppp/3Pn3/6P1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Thematic and good.  I had a long think at this point - even considered exchanging on e5.  The knight exerts considerable influence on the light squares in Black's position - a real nuisance withal.  At the same time White threatens 14.f3 to which I figured I'd have to reply 14...Nc5 and if 15.dxc5 Bxe5.  
435,13,21,1Be8,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pNppp/3Pn3/6P1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Played after much thought.  It was probably just as well to make way for the Queen's knight and to entrench the e8-h5 diagonal as well. Instead 13...Qf6 would probably have been as good an option.  At this point the GKE assessed the position as W1.27 - Advantage White.
436,13,22,1Be3,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pNppp/3Pn3/4B1P1/PPN1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',[?] This move wipes out all that advantage according to the GKE and I'm inclined to agree.  I can see why White would have seen the development of this bishop as a matter of urgency but having waited this long and with nowhere really useful to go it should have waited further.  For example 14.f3! Nc5  15.f4! gxf4 16.Bxf4 Ne6  17.Qd2 would have left White with a great position and Black with problems to solve.  It would have been hard to see any way to revivify the morobund K-side attack.
437,13,23,1f4,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pN1pp/3Pnp2/4B1P1/PPN1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The obvious response as Black's attack gathers momentum.
438,13,24,1gxf4,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pN1pp/3PnP2/4B3/PPN1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',[?!]  For the first time the advantage swings in favour of Black (GKE B0.60).  Instead 15.f3!? Nxg3!? 16.hxg3 fxe3 19.Qd3 ... left a very murky position much harder to call.
439,13,25,1gxf4,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pN2p/3Pnp2/4B3/PPN1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Driving back the bishop and opening up the g-file.  The big concern I have is that Black's King is far more exposed to the elements than is White's.  If White ever manages to wrest back the initiative my King might find himself lacking shelter from the storm.  
440,13,26,1Bc1,b'rn1qbrk1/pp6/2pb4/3pN2p/3Pnp2/8/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',A rather dismal retreat.  I probably would not have exchanged it for my knight had it gone to d2 rather leaving it to shut in the White Queen.  What is keeping White in the game is that stout knight in e5.
441,13,27,1Nd7,b'r2qbrk1/pp1n4/2pb4/3pN2p/3Pnp2/8/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Completing development and threatening to win a pawn by exchanging on e5.

443,13,29,1Bxe5,b'r2qbrk1/pp1n4/2p5/3pb2p/3Pnp2/3Q4/PPN1PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Oddly enough not an easy decision.  Exchanging knights would have kept the DSB but White would simply have blocked the f-pawn (f2-f3) to close off its action towards h2.  I figured a knight on e5 would have more scope than the bishop.
444,13,30,1Qd1,b'r2qbrk1/pp6/2p5/3pn2p/4np2/8/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I really expected something like Qh3 here not so much because it would have been objectively better but it would have been a more active placing.  Black's edge is becoming more pronounced (GKE B1.70).  That White is confined to just two ranks makes a dark impression.  One should note here that although White has the 'bishop pair' that motif is pretty much irrelevant in this game.
445,13,31,1Qh4,b'r3brk1/pp6/2p5/3pn2p/4np1q/8/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Threatening among other things ...Ng4 and/or ...f3.

In view of the threatened f3 and ...Ng4 20.f3! would have cut across both and forced Black to recast his plans.  One possibility was 20.f3 Ng3!  21.Qe1! ... Not 21.hxg3? fxg3  22.Rf2  h4 with a strong attack for Black. You can see though that White was conscious of the pressure on f2.

Even though 25.Bd6 may be objectively better - stopping the Queen sacrifice at h2 for one thing - the difference between assessments of minus 8 and minus 11 is neither here nor there: both represent games too far gone to be salvageable.

480,15,11,1Nf6,b'r2qk2r/4bppp/p1p2n2/8/1p6/1P3N2/1PPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',? Now he develops but this would've been better a move earlier since 14...Qb6 would've been his best move here.  That's because Ted is now going to lose another pawn.

486,16,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I start off with the usual Sicilian Defense.  But Mariann plays this instead of sticking to the mainlines with either 2.Nf3 or 2.Nc3.
487,16,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But I continue as if it's all normal.

Normally I care about all reason which it should be.  But since it we're low on time it doesn't matter to me this time around.  Actually she implied that there was no reason for this by saying ""Just for fun"" with this move."

I say that because I'm also not that good at handling big time crunches like this.
504,16,18,1Kg2,b'r1b1k2r/1p2bpp1/pqnppn1p/2p5/2P3P1/3PNN1B/PP3PKP/R1BQ1R2 b kq -',?! In my books this is pointless because it's not an endgame so the K should not be brought in action yet.  However like me Mary is also under a time crunch and must pack up a noon as well.

512,16,26,1Qh5,b'r4rk1/1p1b1pp1/p1nppb2/2p3NQ/2P5/1P1P3B/P4PKP/q1B2R2 b - -',Threatening mate on me which I'll defend against by liquidating.

But after this move the time has run out for both of us making it an unfinished game.  Mary however was busted from whichever you way you look at with that blunder.  After this game though Jack said that I didn't play well.  I'm not sure what line but he said that there was a line that I could've pinned and won the Queen.  Considering however that time really was of the essence I disagree with Jack.  As this is the best that I've ever played for someone who was on a tight schedule and thus under a major time crunch.

This is a fatal pawn to take if the Bd6 could make a check--which it often can.  In the position I haven't castled yet so for example Bxh2+ is not possible.  With a castled K Qxd5 would lose the Q.

580,18,16,2Qxf4,b'1k5r/1pp5/p2q1p2/3Pn2r/5Q2/PP5P/1BP2PP1/1K1R3R b - -',Now White has an easy potential passed pawn on the Kingside with a 3-1 majority.

585,19,0,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Unlike what we saw with Ken I'm not transposing or differentiating from the mainlines yet this time around since I'm not too used to that defense.  It's later on that I get ready to do that.

587,19,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',This I believe is where I start differentiating.  I don't know what's usually played next after those three lines but I don't care because it's most certainly not a mistake or inaccuracy.  And that's what matters as this is how the student learns as well.  With that being said I'm as usual fixated on castling early since bringing the monarch to safety is something that I enjoy.
588,19,3,Bg2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',But Sue is sticking to the mainlines as I also learned from Ken he differentiated.

591,19,6,Bf5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/5b2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I considered 6...Bg4 with the idea of putting pressure on her Ng4.  As Ken told me pressure is about not knowing what to do.  However I figured out that it could backfired.  That's because she could answer with 7.h3 and then I'm forced to retreat.  Tempo loss is not a horrible deal.  But it was something I wanted to avoid for now in order to complete my development.  Afterall what happens if she attacks and I run back.  She could figure out a different attack or play Bg5 against my N.  And I didn't want that so another way of saying it is that by playing this I'm avoiding pressure as I am not wondering what to do.
592,19,7,Nc3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/5b2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Given that her c pawn has advanced (as that's what you do when playing against the KID) it was safe.
593,19,8,Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/5b2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',For me however it was a different story as the c pawn didn't advance.  So I played this instead to complete my development.  Might seem like a simple reason but there's more that goes into this cognition.  That's because I kept something in mind that Ken told me which you'll see on my next move.  But that weighed in with my decision to play this.
594,19,9,Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/5b2/2PP1B2/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Completing her development.

The idea being is that moves had to be discussed before I played them just like my last unrated game with bhidragon.  And when discussing it and my take he said that chess is about finding a better placement for your pieces.  And that's exactly what happened with this Knight because you don't want it cramped so close to your homesquare.  By that I mean the first or end two ranks of that area.  Once it goes further up then it's better placed.
596,19,11,b3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1n1p1np1/5b2/2PP1B2/1PN2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Getting a solid pawn chain.

This is where I start calculating more then one variation and felt that she could potentially have more then one threat with the N.  It's not now but the concern is later on.  For example what happens if she's able to play something like Ng5.  And then I'm a little concerned about her bringing the Queen c2 and then coordinating her DSB.  We could be talking about forces that might weaken my K.  I wouldn't normally be worried except for what I learned with bhidragon because it appears to me that the board was potentially telling a big story.  In order to understand my idea was not taking chances or allowing it.  So this time I do have that readiness to exchange if needed.
598,19,13,1e4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1n1p1np1/8/2PPPBb1/1PN2NP1/P4PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - e3',The good news is that an exchange isn't needed yet as this was played.
599,19,14,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/1n1p1np1/2p5/2PPPBb1/1PN2NP1/P4PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - c6',So I'm ready to exchange pawns instead.  I looked at the possibilities of taking on c5 keeping in mind that she can't take back with her Nf3 as it's pinned which was the logic behind 9...Bg4 when thinking about what it could do.  So what happens were she to take back with the Queen.  I'd play ...e5.  I didn't think she'd go for that because you're talking about forking Queen and N.  Can be broken but not at the expense of losing a piece.  So like what you saw in the game chat with Kenneth_fiore_3 when he was going to get my Queen for Rook I was just as interested in what Sue would play.  It's also based on what Ken outlined that in coaching you make the position more and more difficult so that the student has to figure out what to do.
600,19,15,1Qc1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/1n1p1np1/2p5/2PPPBb1/1PN2NP1/P4PBP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',? But she played this which I later pointed out to be a mistake as this going to win a pawn.
601,19,16,1Nxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/1n1p1np1/8/2PNPBb1/1PN3P1/P4PBP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',?? Not knowing what occurred she played this.  This is where the mentoring starts and what I mentioned is combined with the last move.  This was a blunder. It looks good at appeared that white has gotten something back. But this move is going to cost more material.  But 11.Qc1? was a mistake before that as it costed a pawn.  After this I gave her Homework which went right back to 10...c5.  The question was finding the best move for white in other words how white should proceed in the position.  Sue: was it d5?  Joe: d5 is a good move. I was thinking cxd4 and after I take back black hasn't lost anything. But d5 also works. In other words it's just as good.  
602,19,17,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p1np1/4p1B1/2PNP1b1/1PN3P1/P4PBP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',? Although pinning my Nf6 this was mistake.  I mentioned when the game was over.  Similar to ION I generally you won't say much in a winning position.  However this was different as it builds up to overall moral which I learned with my teacher.  But in this case better was 13.Nc2  Although a little cramped she would've gotten a pawn in return.  By playing this it's a free piece.
603,19,18,1Nb5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p1np1/1N4B1/2PpP1b1/1P4P1/P4PBP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',I calculated what Sue might be trying to do.  I figured that maybe she wanted a pawn.  But going with more then one thing as it looked like a potential for multiple threat that the potential is real.  Her plan is 15.Qg4 for if she does that my d6 is a target.
604,19,19,1Be2,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p1np1/1N4B1/2PpP3/1P4P1/P3bPBP/R1Q2RK1 w - -',To keep it safe I attack her Rook.

As this should give her a little compensation.  My only reason behind playing this was to break the nasty pin since I knew what I did in the game that I lost.  Afterall that's what happened in a game.  However unlike before what's sinking in is that I didn't consider if it worked in this position.  The idea is on top of combining it with a game the position in itself is critical.  I'm lucky that Sue didn't spot it but am upset with myself because a more experienced player would've compensated when the idea is not giving the student a chance to compensate as Ken once emphasized before our training game.  
606,19,21,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pb1/1n1p1npp/1N6/2PpPB2/1P4P1/P3bPBP/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',She played this instead.  And I made a mistake in my comment that had to make things wait until the last move.  As I said that I was thinking about that pin too much and trying to break. But there are multiple variations that go into it. With that being said even though you're behind slightly better was 16.Rxe2 as it regains a pawn. As then I'd continue with 16...d3 after which you can quick play 17.Rd2 with 17...hxg5 18.Rxd3 to follow. 
607,19,22,1d3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pb1/1n1p1npp/1N6/2P1PB2/1P1p2P1/P3bPBP/R1Q1R1K1 w - -',Trying to prevent her from getting the pawn and similar to Edna's last annotation being fixated on that passed pawn I played this.  The difference is that I calculated more then one variation but the problem is that in that extra calculation I overlooked something important.  What kept in mind was that pawn plus it doesn't appear that white can get a pawn anymore.  So another variation that I looked at was 17.Bxd6 with the idea being 17...Qxd6  What I had overlooked and thus wouldn't have played was 17...Qxd6?? because of where her Knight is placed.  That's right we're talking about Nb5.  But that's bad as she can still win my pawn.
608,19,23,1Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pb1/1n1p1npp/1N6/2P1PB2/1P1p2P1/P2QbPBP/R3R1K1 b - -',Sue however overlooked that and played this to stop my passed pawn.  What she didn't realize is that even if I wanted that pawn couldn't advance.  One variation that I didn't mention on the 16th degree (when playing 16...d3) was 16...d2?? which considered.  As I thought about forking her Queen and Rook.  It however is ineffective for had I done that she would've for one thing gotten a pawn back with Qxd2.  Although she had a chance to do something like that before this would've been worse as not only don't you promote but the threat is winding up ahead now since my Be2 would be en-prise.  I'd see that but at the cost of protecting I'd lose tempo which is something that you don't want here.  After which then she might pick up another pawn with d6 which would've almost equal.  And I wasn't going to allow that.  But with this move I keep that pawn safe.
609,19,24,1Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/pp3pb1/1n1p2pp/1N6/2P1PB2/1P1p2P1/P2QbPBP/R3R1K1 w - -',As now there's coverage with my N.  On top of that Sue's faced with a discovered attack on her Ra1.
610,19,25,1Be3,b'r2qnrk1/pp3pb1/1n1p2pp/1N6/2P1P3/1P1pB1P1/P2QbPBP/R3R1K1 b - -',?? To my surprise however Sue overlooked that.  However I wouldn't have been if she played 18.Bf3 with the idea of getting a Bishop in return as that was the first variation I thought of because either way she gets a Bishop in return.  But it's still a loss of more material and thus not enough compensation.  The second thing I looked at however is what I thought she'd do of protecting her Ra8.
611,19,26,Qf6,b'r3nrk1/pp3p2/1n1p1qpp/1N6/2P1P3/1P1pB1P1/P2QbPBP/R5K1 w - -',I considered 19...h6 with the of protecting my pawn at once.  But I decided that it was worth looking at this which got played with the idea of attacking her.  Like before my anticipation was protecting.  What I considered however was the second variation which she played.  That's because I kept in mind that I instead of protecting it I can let her have it with this.  I however didn't think she'd take.  I believe that she was thinking along the lines of this because once she took it didn't appear that I could get a free Rook since my Rf8 was a target.  What she missed however is that when I took it was a check and mate would be threatened.  With that being said this is going to cost her the other Rook.  Unlike before this will be without compensation because of what I outlined with her being in check.
612,19,27,2Bf1,b'r3nrk1/pp3p2/1n1p2pB/1N6/2P1P3/1P1p2P1/P2QbP1P/q4BK1 b - -',?? This is her final blunder and I said something here.  Which was Although in trouble this move leads to mate. In this position 21.Qc1 was the only move that holds white in longer. And then comes 21...Qxc1 22.Qxc1 It is liquidation while far behind which is problematic. But it does however prevent an immediate mate. 
613,19,28,2Qxf1#,b'r3nrk1/pp3p2/1n1p2pB/1N6/2P1P3/1P1p2P1/P2QbP1P/5qK1 w - -',"After this game I gave her moral.  But in order to do so I decided to point out all the errors so that Sue would learn what it all boiled down to since it happened shortly after understanding what went wrong in my rated game against bhidragon.  Therefore what I told Sue boils down to the moral of this game.  So I messaged her and said You played very well in the beginning of the KID. But on the Queen should've stayed on d1. That's because 11.Qc1? was the first mistake as it enabled me to win a pawn. Then you took back with 12.Nxd4?? which enabled me to fork your B and N. Better was to retreat the N as you would've gotten a pawn for piece. But you pinned the N which got a free piece. Later on there was a discovered attack against your Rook. But I think you were concerned about me hitting the B so the move was 18.Be3 which enabled me to get a Rook for Bishop. After that was taking the pawn and threatening the Rook but then I took the other Rook with check. Last the B as opposed to the Q came up which ended in mate. I would say that the overall lesson to learn here is something that one of my mentors recently taught me which I used to defeat Ted in the most recent annotation. It's to see the overall picture (entire story) that the board is telling you. In other words don't get fixated on one or two details (or as the saying goes ""don't cry over spilt milk"" But look at all of the details that happen on the board as then you can focus on what's really important."
614,20,0,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',It's allright for Joe to play this as we saw in that lecture.  But it will cause damage if the opponent doesn't develop.  In fact TA as a moral to his Q sac said something that if they played foolish (which he means) undeveloping moves like him there will be consequences.
615,20,1,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1pppppp1/p6p/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This also doesn't develop either which I would've done as black.

628,20,14,1a4,b'2kr3r/1bqnppb1/p4n1p/1ppp2p1/P7/3PPN2/1PP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQ a3',But Joe will have none of that.  For one thing TA has mentioned that one of the ways he wins in those Q sac blitz is with the semi open files.  Where you exchange wing pawns to leave a path for the Rook.  Those are things which his opponents overlook.  So this move is a perfect example as that's what Joe is attempting.
629,20,15,1b4,b'2kr3r/1bqnppb1/p4n1p/2pp2p1/Pp6/3PPN2/1PP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',This opponent however did not overlook as he stopped it with this move.
630,20,16,1c3,b'2kr3r/1bqnppb1/p4n1p/2pp2p1/Pp6/2PPPN2/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',Threatening to exchange but before black allows it he'll stop Joe's a pawn from advancing any further.
631,20,17,1Nd4,b'2kr3r/1bqnppb1/5n1p/p2p2p1/Pp1N4/3PP3/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',Bringing his N to a better outpost.
632,20,18,1e5,b'2kr3r/1bqn1pb1/5n1p/p2pp1p1/Pp1N4/3PP3/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQ e6',Which is his opponent attacks.
633,20,19,1Nb5,b'2kr3r/1bqn1pb1/5n1p/pN1pp1p1/Pp6/3PP3/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',But this was the real plan behind Joe playing 18.Nd4 as now black must protect his Q.  After which Joe will continue with his development.
634,20,20,Kb8,b'1k1r3r/1b1n1pb1/1q3n1p/pN1pp1p1/Pp6/3PP3/1P1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I'm not sure why black played this but Joe will waste no time in bringing his Nd2 to a better outpost.  As it is right now white's position is a little cramped since his Bc1 is locked in.  But that will change with white's next move.
635,20,21,Nc5,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/1q3n1p/pNnpp1p1/Pp6/1N1PP3/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Threatening to exchange N's which Joe abides by.  With that being said though I think that this was an inaccuracy because black's Nd7 appears more active then Joe's Nb3.  If he declined though I'd see the point.  But I'm basing the opinion combined with what Joe does on GM Susan Polgar's answer to my question in regards to exchanges.
636,20,22,2d4,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5n1p/pNqpp1p1/Pp1P4/4P3/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Threatening an exchange for once he does white will have better control of the center despite not being castled or completely developed.  So I think that black is already starting to become overly confident as we saw at the intro of this annotation.
637,20,23,2O-O,b'1k1r3r/1b2qpb1/5n1p/pN1p2p1/Pp1P4/8/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',As the gain enables Joe to castle.
638,20,24,2Ne4,b'1k1r3r/1b2qpb1/7p/pN1p2p1/Pp1Pn3/8/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I'm not sure why black played this but it'll enable Joe to complete his development at once.
639,20,25,Qf6,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q1p/pN1p2p1/Pp1Pn1B1/8/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',My guess is that black was intending to put pressure on Joe's K side.
640,20,26,2Be3,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q1p/pN1p2p1/Pp1Pn1B1/4B3/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But Joe stops that with this move.
641,20,27,2h5,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q2/pN1p2pp/Pp1Pn1B1/4B3/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Attacking the Bishop which is of no concern to Joe.  And I'd feel the same were I white here.
642,20,28,2Bf3,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q2/pN1p2pp/Pp1Pn3/4BB2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So Joe threatens to exchange N for B.
643,20,29,2g4,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q2/pN1p3p/Pp1Pn1p1/4BB2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?! Maybe to gain time.  But in my books this is where black starts to go wrong as Joe will be able exchange.  The idea being is that he has allowed Joe to exchange black's N for his B.  Of more significance is that black's Ne4 is much more active then white's Bf3.  So I feel that black is setting himself up for disaster.  The Be3 however were more active.   Therefore I believe that much better would've been 28...Ng5  Either it's N for B but Joe would've been forced to exchange his more active B though.
644,20,30,3Qc1,b'1k1r3r/1b3pb1/5q2/pN5p/Pp1Pp1p1/4B3/1P3PPP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',As now Joe's got some nasty threats against black.  One threat would start off immediately with 31.Qc7+ and after he gets out of check then another threat could come with d5.  Or the reverse could happen where Joe plays 31.d5 and then Qc7+ etc.
645,20,31,3Rdc8,b'1kr4r/1b3pb1/5q2/pN5p/Pp1Pp1p1/4B3/1P3PPP/R1Q2RK1 w - -',So black stops that threat with this move.  But there's another threat that cannot be stopped starting with 31.Bf4+
646,20,32,3d5,b'2r4r/kbN2pb1/5q2/p2P3p/Pp2pBp1/8/1P3PPP/R1Q2RK1 b - -',As now we're talking about a passed pawn which would eventually promote.  but bigger is what comes being 34.Be3+ 34.Nb5+ which happens later or 34.Qe3+ as is played the next move.  Either way I think it's safe to say that black is lost with best play.
647,20,33,3Qe2,b'2rr4/1b3pb1/kq6/pN1P3p/Pp2pBp1/8/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Since a nasty discovered with 37.Nd6+ is threatened as at the very least black would win a Rook for Bishop with that N fork.  And this is why I also feel that black went wrong by allowing Joe to exchange the active Knight for his passive Bishop similar to what Susan also outlined.  With that being said just like with my training game against Kenneth_fiore_3 the position has become impossible to defend.  
648,20,34,3Rc5,b'3r4/1b3pb1/kq6/pNrP3p/Pp2pBp1/8/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',At least black is going to get a pawn but it's not enough compensation to save the position.
649,20,35,3Rac1,b'3r4/1b3pb1/kq6/pNrP3p/Pp2pBp1/8/1P2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',That's because black will take and after that white will knab the Rook.  
650,20,36,3Rxc5,b'3r4/5pb1/kq6/pNRb3p/Pp2pBp1/8/1P2QPPP/5RK1 b - -',After which black resigns.  That's because it's a free Rook for if black takes back with 38...Qxc5?? then it's mate after 39.Nc7+ with a double check.  After that white plays 40.Qa6# which is mate.  
651,21,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Aiming for an italian opening. I am not familiar with playing this with black I must say but I guess is all about flipping sides. But since I am better aware with the three knight defence I will try that.
652,21,1,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So white refuses to go for the classic 4.Ng5 d5; 5.exd Na5 line. Instead it goes for a slow variant if I may say so (haven't played this since I was ten...many moons ago) but safe and solid. It gives time for black to develop quietly if properly done.
653,21,2,c3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"So eventually goes for the ""pianissimo"" mode very slow very safe. Now it is important for the amateur here to keep an eye on this set up on the board since it reproduces a very common position/situation in this opening (as well as with some Spanish variants). e5 is held by Nc6 but white now threats to hit the Bc5 and then the Nc6 therefore potentially gaining on e5. And thus it is again making the point on how important is not only know the moves but the basis why it may or may not be advantageous going in that direction (gaining a pawn) and most importantly how to reply adequately to those (weak or not) attacks. In this case I find myself int rouble because I couldn't reply with energy so you will see blacks position is not that good as it should have been (as I think it should after the incoming exchange). Judge by yourselves."
654,21,3,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',  Developing and finding safety is a golden rule I try to follow thinking I may get something back after Nxe5.
655,21,4,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/nP2N3/2B1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',So I foresaw until here where I thought I could even things after removing Bc4 (once WN is is moved back). Notice that otherwise N@a5 plays little there and sees no action at all.
656,21,5,Nxf7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2Npp/1b1p1n2/nP6/2B1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',But instead  white goes for the exchange in f7 which again I didn't think of. White has (will) two pawns and the rook for the minor pieces which may be a good trade (not sure though)
657,21,6,Rxf7,b'r1bq2k1/ppp2rpp/1b1p1n2/nP6/2B1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',A must
658,21,7,1O-O,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/1b1p1n2/nP6/4P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',So now  as you can see the pawn force on the queen side keeps BN on a5 at bay while the center and the king's can be supported by heavy artillery (after a few developing moves) and run to break BK's defences (which stand weak). Therefore a run for development and defence has started. I must say I did not see any clear line here to play everything looked quite jammed but I guess binging my rook into my king's aid should be done promptly or at least to the center.
659,21,8,1Kg8,b'r1bq2k1/ppp3pp/1b1p1n2/nP6/4P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',"Eventually I have to go back to safety and also frees the ""f"" file."
660,21,9,1a4,b'r1bq2k1/ppp3pp/1b1p1n2/nP6/P3P3/2PP4/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - a3',I guess with the idea to help on b5 in case of Bc7 but otherwise seems a little bit slow to me. White needs in my opinion stronger moves to strengthen the momentum.
661,21,10,1Be6,b'r2q2k1/ppp3pp/1b1pbn2/nP6/P3P3/2PP4/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',After I did this I started not to like black's position very much (even less than before) because that center of pawns was really frightening me: I was seeing them advancing in force and clogging my queen's flank and at the same time making room for the rooks to come at me. but again you have to keep calm and think white also needs to develop. Since the g1-a7 diagonal is mine it is worth thinking on attacking f2 an put some pressure off the center and flank. And there I went.
662,21,11,1Nd2,b'r2q2k1/ppp3pp/1b1pbn2/nP6/P3P3/2PP4/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',A natural and good movement. It also keeps black from releasing N to b3 and then trading it for the BWS on c1 leaving black with the pair of bishops advantage.
663,21,12,1Qe7,b'r5k1/ppp1q1pp/1b1pbn2/nP6/P3P3/2PP4/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',"With the idea of ...Rf8. Again not sure if ...Qd7 would have been better since the ""e"" file is taken by white"
664,21,13,1Ba3,b'r5k1/ppp1q1pp/1b1pbn2/nP6/P3P3/B1PP4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',An unpleasant and unexpected move. White now is not only developing but also keeping the aforementioned momentum is pinning d6 and therefore bringing some pain to my defence. Black needs to be very careful now (not that I was though). Bb6 needs to be released some how maybe with either a6 or c6. I opted for a6 since it does not wakens the support on d6.
665,21,14,1e5,b'r5k1/1pp1q1pp/pb1pbn2/nP2P3/P7/B1PP4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And there goes white. Very good very aggressive movement. Threatens to weak d6 after the exchange.
666,21,15,1Ne8,b'r3n1k1/1pp1q1pp/pb1pb3/nP2P3/P7/B1PP4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I brought my N to e8 but then I have blocked the access to f8 by my rook. One more time black is still on the defensive and with no good prospects.
667,21,16,1exd6,b'r3n1k1/1pp1q1pp/pb1Pb3/nP6/P7/B1PP4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I thought my rival would hold the trade for awhile since I cannot do much so far. This may be easing my position a little bit or so I thought.
668,21,17,1c4,b'r5k1/1pp1q1pp/pb1nb3/nP6/P1P5/B2P4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But then it comes the pawn advance I was afraid of. Not many good moves at hand and very little time to think of. The threat on c5 and the pinned Nd6 are really a pain.
669,21,18,1Qf6,b'r5k1/1pp3pp/pb1nbq2/nP6/P1P5/B2P4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I panicked even when I saw that 18.c5 gains a piece. 17...Bd4 was a must.
670,21,19,1Bxd6,b'r5k1/1pp3pp/pb1Bbq2/nP6/P1P5/3P4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Lucky me white made also his biggest mistake here. 
671,21,20,1Ne4,b'r5k1/1p4pp/pb1pbq2/nP6/P1P1N3/3P4/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Centering that N where it is stronger and also attacks both queen and d6 and at the same time defends f2.
672,21,21,1Qd4,b'r5k1/1p4pp/pb1pb3/nP6/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I believe this is best. puts some pressure on f2 while defending d6 and also avoids being a target of white's rooks.
673,21,22,2Rb1,b'r5k1/1p4pp/pb1pb3/nP6/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',Now white starts to tight my positing taking advantage of the rook on open files. Again a good move.
674,21,23,2Rf8,b'5rk1/1p4pp/pb1pb3/nP6/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Trying to divert some action to the other side (where I basically my only chances of complicating the game lie)
675,21,24,bxa6,b'5rk1/6pp/pb1pb3/n7/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Notice now that BQ is some how oversaturated defending pieces. White will go for her wisely.
676,21,25,2Kh1,b'5rk1/6pp/pb1pb3/n7/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',But first removes the pinned pawn problem.
677,21,26,2Nc6,b'5rk1/6pp/pbnpb3/8/P1PqN3/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',15 moves later BN starts to make a living. Again the idea is to pressure white's castling.
678,21,27,2Ng5,b'5rk1/6pp/pbnpb3/6N1/P1Pq4/3P4/5PPP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',Now a few jumps to bring some more troubles to my queen.
679,21,28,Qc5,b'5rk1/6pp/pbnp4/2q2b2/P1P5/3P1N2/5PPP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',Only one to save B on b6. Lucky me d4 is still well defended by my army.
680,21,29,2Qb3,b'5rk1/6pp/pbnp4/2q2b2/P1P5/1Q1P1N2/5PPP/1R3R1K b - -',More preassure. notice that White if allowed will have a check if c4 can advance on c5. So ...
681,21,30,2Bd8,b'3b1rk1/6pp/p1np4/2q2b2/P1P5/1Q1P1N2/5PPP/1R3R1K w - -',... coming back to d8 doesn't seem like a bad idea.
682,21,31,2Rbd1,b'3b1rk1/6pp/p1np4/2q2b2/P1P5/1Q1P1N2/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',d3 is not pinned anymore and can freely advance on d4
683,21,32,2Bg4,b'3b1rk1/6pp/p1np4/2q5/P1P3b1/1Q1P1N2/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',"But now I can try to double those pawns on the ""f"" file. Not a real gain but something is something."
684,21,33,2d4,b'3b1rk1/6pp/p1np4/2q5/P1PP2b1/1Q3N2/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',I was expecting this. Advance advance is what white's position is screaming up (to me at least)
685,21,34,2Qh5,b'3b1rk1/6pp/p1np4/7q/P1PP2b1/1Q3N2/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',let's go for those double pawns on f...but what if... well we'll see
686,21,35,Kh8,b'3b1r1k/6pp/p1np4/2P4q/P2P2b1/1Q3N2/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',"Now BK is ""trapped"" on that corner. Careful with the 8 rank there a classic mate might be awaiting there."
687,21,36,2cxd6,b'3b1r1k/6pp/p1nP4/7q/P2P2b1/1Q3N2/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',"This was also I think a slight mistake that I didn't even myself realised while playing. Not sure if 29.Qb7 or 29. Rd3 would have been more active but thinking on the situation is coming next... Now I have been talking about doubling those pawns on the ""f"" file considering trading Bxf6 and so on but what about 29..."
688,21,37,2Rxf3,b'3b3k/6pp/p1nP4/7q/P2P2b1/1Q3r2/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',! I was surprised to find this even when the feeling of leaving the 8th rank is not really pleasant. But for a moment it was clear to me I had gained that N. Can it be a solid gain? We'll see.
689,21,38,3Qb7,b'3b3k/1Q4pp/p1nP4/7q/P2P2b1/5r2/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',Is the only one I saw while analyzing the board after 29...Rxf3. But it seems 30...Qd5 saves the day for black. However there is even a better move:
690,21,39,3Rh3,b'3b3k/1Q4pp/p1nP4/7q/P2P2b1/7r/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',I can't help but loving this. I like it even better that 29...Rxf3 since it is even less expected. There is a mate threat on h1 and if gxh3 then Bf3+ and mate. Quite a complete move! Interesting that white cannot go for the mate on 8th and that it i blocked by a simple B on d8.
691,21,40,3f3,b'3b3k/1Q4pp/p1nP4/7q/P2P2b1/5P1r/6PP/3R1R1K b - -',Last gamble on white and a very good one too. it creates a way out for the king while also hitting a second piece.
692,21,41,Qh4,b'3b3k/1Q4pp/p1nP4/8/P2P2bq/5P2/6Pr/3R1RK1 w - -',But there is no option now for white. Is going to be mate in a  few moved. A very very interesting game with interesting ideas and a happy ending (to me) that makes it a very beautiful game! But  remember also that is was a blitz game making it difficult to find good moves and very easy to find real bad ones. Hope you have enjoyed it as I did!
693,22,0,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The first few moves were conventional but after 4.Ba4 4...b5 is the most common answer and then it continues with 5.Bb3 Na5 followed by an exchange black takes on b3 and white takes back with the a pawn as then you're capturing towards the center.  But there's nothing wrong with this move as it's similar to the Berlin Defense.
694,22,1,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So I treat it as though it were the Berlin Defense since castling is the most common reply there.
695,22,2,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',She develops.  Although it's not an inaccuracy preferable was 5...Nxe4 in which white often responds with 6.Re1 and when the N retreats white gets back a pawn.  Of course similar to archduke_piccolo with this student it was in the wrong sequence which should've lost a pawn.
696,22,3,d4,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',? Thinking about the exchange variation starting with 6...Nxe4 but it's where I start to miscalculate.  However this is a mistake as it should lose a pawn as we're about to see.  Better was to centralize a Rook with 6.Re1 since what I'm thinking of has the Rook in that spot which is why it's part of the mainlines in the Berlin Defense.
697,22,4,d5,b'r1bqk2r/1pp1bppp/p1n2n2/3p4/B2NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',This is Sue's first blunder so the mentoring starts here.  Joe: ?? This is going to lose material as we'll see. I know what then plan was which is exchanging pawns. But I miscalculated when playing e4 because I got it mixed up with what the most common way in which the Ruy Lopez continues so mainlines. So better would've been take on e4 because after 4...dxe4 I'm down a pawn.  Sue: Our pawns are equal and you have the better position.  Joe: It's true that they are but it's about what's to come. I say that because the N on f6 would've prevented that  The reason behind all of this is because your Nc6 was attacked twice and only defended once Sue which is something to take note of in the future. 
698,22,5,Kf8,b'r1bq1k1r/2p1bppp/p1B5/3n4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',?? And I give Sue Homework with the second blunder which she answered correctly.  Joe: Ok there was another move that would've gotten you out of check. And that was 10...Bd7 Why would that have been better?  Sue: I was thinking you would have taken my knight. of course if I had done that I could have cashed I am now going to loose my Rook which I didn't notice.  Joe: Yes if you had played that I would've gotten the Knight which is a piece.  But by moving the monarch it becomes a free Rook.
699,22,6,Nb6,b'B1bq1k1r/2p1bppp/pn6/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Now I'm familiar with the motivation behind this move (chess thought process) as that's how I used to think.  Sue is thinking ok Joe won a Rook but I will try to compensate by attacking it.  But as I've also learned the hard way there is no compensation for that.  I like her fighting spirit but the lesson is that in general once you lose something it's gone.  With that being said I exchange first because the liquidating while ahead.  Then I will defend and when that happens she'll be faced with multiple threats.
700,22,7,1Bc6,b'2bb1k1r/2p2ppp/pnB5/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',As now her back rank is weakened.  It'll be difficult to defend this position without losing material.  I did get ideas from Ken in our training game which I'll discuss as it blends in with our first lesson.  And it's the same lesson that I forgot with Bernard when distracted and consequently was punished.  
701,22,8,1Bf6,b'2b2k1r/2p2ppp/pnB2b2/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',She is developing though.  My guess is that Sue intends to complete development.
702,22,9,1Re1,b'2b2k1r/2p2ppp/pnB2b2/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',But this is where we really see the multiple threats.  This was played for two reasons.  First the idea was centralizing one of the Rooks since it's generally a good idea to do so.  More importantly however is the fact that I'm threatening mate in more then one way since my Bc6 and the Rook are now bad enough.  It's not going to be easy.  And with the best move the position is further comprised.
703,22,10,1g6,b'2b2k1r/2p2p1p/pnB2bp1/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',?? Which is noted here because I said Better was 14...Be7 but white wins another piece after 15.Bg5 since mate is threatened. Best however was 14...Bd7 after which I'd liquidate 15.Bxd7 Nxd7 It's true that you don't want to liquidate when behind but it is better then mate. As now mate is forced.
704,22,11,Bg7,b'2b2k1r/2p2pbp/pnB3pB/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',That's because her only other option would've been 15...Kg8 but after that I'd mate in the same move.  In other words the next move would be the same which is also checkmate.
705,22,12,1Re8#,b'2b1Rk1r/2p2pbp/pnB3pB/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN4K1 b - -',After this game I messaged Sue.  And this is where I remembered what Ken said to not only teach but use that lesson as the moral of this game.  So I said My advice believe it or not is the same as what Kenneth_fiore_3 gave me. And I base it on that game combined with what happened in the first game which he pointed out. It's to look out for multiple as opposed to one threat. And there's also to calculate through those variations. For example you played ...g6 to prevent the immediate Re8# but didn't see my DSB with the pieces around the monarch I was able to organize them. So playing through those lines and figuring out if there's more then one threat is a good way to become a better chess player.  The other thing that I got forgot to mention Sue is to compare your attackers and defenders to his or her attackers or defenders and take not of that.     
706,23,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The alekhine defence. Usually I don't allow black to tempt me to extend my pawns but I decided to make an exception
707,23,1,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Now the game is looking something like the four pawn attack
708,23,2,fxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4P3/2PP4/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The correct pawn capture I think dxe5 isn't too good.. Now I have the open f-file for my rook after I castle
709,23,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4P3/2PP4/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A bit inaccurate. He should have played Bf5 before this move

712,23,6,1Ne4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/nnp1p3/4P3/2PPN3/3B1N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',?! I'm not sure about this my move though it seems a bit slow

A better defensive plan for black was 12. g6 13. Re8 14. Bf8 to hold the dark squares around his king. Note that g6 also prevents sacrificial ideas on h7
714,23,8,1Nh3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/nnp1p2p/4P3/2PP4/3B3N/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',My opponent might think he got a tempo on me but what he just did was create a target for me

716,23,10,1Bb1,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/1np1p2p/4P3/1nPP4/7N/PP4PP/RBBQ1RK1 b - -',The best place for this bishop. The b1-h7 diagonal is just too juicy to leave

723,23,17,1Qe7,b'r4rk1/pp1bqp2/2p1p1BB/4P3/1n1P2Q1/7N/Pn4PP/R4RK1 w - -',??? This loses very quickly. Black sees the danger of accepting and tries to bring in the queen for defence so as to capture my LSB next move but...

725,24,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am playing some higher players in this mini-tournament and I will try to use the games as instruction on good and bad moves.  ie their good moves and my bad moves.
726,24,1,Bb4,b'rn1q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',All the opening moves are played for the Queens Indian Defence (as per game title) to whites move 7. and we begin to make our moves now.  Black to start and he opens with DB to b4 attacking my knight.
727,24,2,Bg5,b'rn1q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I decide to attack blacks night at f3 with my DB which develops it as well.  I am forgetting that my knight at c3 is under attack and if taken will leave me with double pawns. And black will have access to 'b' file.
728,24,3,h6,b'rn1q1rk1/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/6B1/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',My c3 knight is safe for now and black instead pushes his h pawn to h6 and kicks me off g5.

I probably should have pushed my c pawn and tried to attack on c5 and this would have broken the chain and given me more centre space.
732,24,7,1Bh3,b'rn1q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/2PP1B2/2P2NPB/P3PP1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Instead I make a move with my LB to h3 (I was preparing to move my g3 pawn up so this LB was protecting g4).  I may be going to learn a hard lesson about moving your LB unnecessarily.  Perhaps a better move would have been moving my e pawn up which is a move I make and I would then have 3 pawns in a row but I seem to have forgotten this! 
733,24,8,1exf3,b'rn1q1rk1/2pp1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/2PP1B2/2P2PPB/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Black decides to take my f3 knight with his LB and again I can only retake with my pawn so I will have doubled pawns again.  I don't think this is too bad on the 'f' file as it provides protection to my king.  Now there is the 'e' file for black to access but my rook is able to access too.
734,24,9,1g4,b'rn1q1rk1/2p2pp1/1p1ppn1p/p7/2PP1BP1/2P2P1B/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I move my pawn g3- g4 taking control of more squares around my king.

738,24,13,1a3,b'rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p1ppn1p/6p1/p1PP2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I block this a4 pawn with a2-a3.

740,24,15,1c5,b'rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p2pn1p/2Pp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',It seems I have only one move which is moving my top pawn of my doubled pawns on the c file to c5.  I could have taken on d5 but this would have been captured by black's e6 or I would have been left with doubled pawns on the d file.
741,24,16,1b5,b'rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/4pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black moves his pawn b6-b5 and if he moves his c7 pawn next will have taken control of the diagonal a4 to c6 with his pawns.
742,24,17,1Bd2,b'rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/4pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P2P1B/3B1P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I move my DB to d2 protecting my c3 pawn as I think that black may move his b5 pawn down to attack it.  
743,24,18,1c6,b'rn1q1rk1/5p2/2p1pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P2P1B/3B1P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black moves c7-c6 and his pawns are now connected and he has a very strong pawn defence while my pawns are doubled on 2 files and I am restricted by his c6 and d5 pawns from doing anything in the centre.
744,24,19,1Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/5p2/2p1pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I move my DB back up to e3.  I have purely been acting in defence mode and not as white should play by making the moves with black defending.  I do not see that he is about to bring his last flank pawn to c6.  So instead I should have moved to c6 with my pawn but I would have been captured by the knight.  So black is in charge.
745,24,20,1Qc7,b'rn3rk1/2q2p2/2p1pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black moves Qc7 attacking the pawn at h2.

If this pawn is retaken it is protected by my LB at g2 but the LB could be retaken by the knight at f6.
759,24,34,2Nxe4,b'r7/2qnrpk1/2p4p/1pPp2p1/p2Pn1P1/P1P1B3/5PBP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black captures my pawn with the knight at f6.  This is difficult for me to retake as it is protected by the pawn at d5.

I could have moved my DB but it would have involved taking it down to c1 and this would have meant the rooks were no longer together and if I had moved it to d2 or f2 black could have captured with his knight.

All he has is an extra piece and one passed pawn.

905,26,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Englund Gambit.  I have not played against this before.  According to Wikipedia the idea is for Black to move into a tactical game and away from the closed d4 openings.  I thought the game definitely had more of an e4 character so I think it succeeded at that.
906,26,1,Bxd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/8/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black is down a pawn but has an extra tempo to compensate.
907,26,2,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I think maybe Bd7 or a6 was better here if the goal is to keep White's N off b5.  c6 takes away a good square for the N.
908,26,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Black puts the extra tempo to good use here.
909,26,4,1Be3,b'rn1qr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/7b/4P3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I'm not sure if this is the best square for the B.  g5 may be a better option.
910,26,5,1Bxf6,b'rn2r1k1/ppb1qpp1/2p2B1p/7b/4P3/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',This is definitely not smart.  It gives Black too much pressure of f3.
911,26,6,Qf4,b'rn2r1k1/ppb2pp1/2p4p/8/4PqP1/2NB1N2/PPP2P2/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black sacrifices the B to open White's K.  White needs to get reinforcements to the Kingside as quickly as possible.
912,26,7,Na6,b'r3r1k1/ppb2pp1/n1p4p/8/4PqP1/2N2N2/PPP2P2/R2QRBK1 w - -',This awkward development is required because c6 is blocked.  
913,26,8,Bf4,b'r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2p4p/2n5/4Pbq1/2N1QN2/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 w - -',I think this was an oversight.  Black was thinking about his attack and didn't notice his N was hanging.
914,26,9,2Qf5,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2p1r2p/5Q2/4Pbq1/2N2N2/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 b - -',This forces the exchange of Qs.  If White can defuse the Kingside attack the position should be won easily.
915,26,10,Rxf4,b'4r1k1/pp3pp1/2p4p/8/4Pr2/5N2/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 w - -',Black is down to two Rs.
916,26,11,Re6,b'6k1/pp3pp1/2p1r2p/8/4Pr2/5N2/PPP2PB1/3RR1K1 w - -',Black avoids Rxe4.  It will lead to further exchanges and a loss of material after 25...Rxe4  26. Rxe4 Rxe4  27. Rd8+ Kh7  28. Ng5+ hxg5  29. Bxe4.
917,26,12,2Rd6,b'6k1/pp3pp1/2pR2rp/4P3/5r2/5N2/PPP2PB1/4R1K1 b - -',Threatening the exchange of Rs.
918,26,13,2Bxf3,b'6k1/pp4p1/2p3pp/4P3/8/5B2/PPP2P2/4R1K1 b - -',White's material advantage is now decisive.
919,26,14,3Bh5+,b'4k3/pp2P1p1/2p4p/6pB/8/8/PPP2P2/4R1K1 b - -',White's pawn will promote.
920,26,15,3Kd7,b'8/pp1kP1p1/2p4p/6pB/8/8/PPP2P2/4R1K1 w - -',Black resigned here.  White's biggest problem will be figuring out the most efficient checkmate.  There is no chance to lose this position now.
921,27,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I was interested in what Bernnie would do.  In the past I've been white and have played 1.e4.  Only once was 1.d4 played to try out the Colle's Franketort System which was in the game before this.  But this is what he played.
922,27,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So I stick to mainlines as this could either become a KID or Colle's System.  What I had in mind was the KID.
923,27,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But it turns out to be the Colle's System.
924,27,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Whether it's this or Colle's this is the most common move anyhow.  So the idea is sticking with what you know.
925,27,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',But he's transposing the Colle's into the KID.  I'm thinking that he might be trying to fool me or get into something that I don't know.
926,27,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Which won't work because when Kenneth_fiore_3 played the KID it wasn't from regular mainlines.  Instead he transposed into that line so I'm all too familiar with this approach.
927,27,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Thus I develop at once.
928,27,7,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! The bad news is that I reversed colors since it's white who should be fianchettoing on the Queen instead of the King side.  And black should fianchetto on opposite wing.  Which makes this inaccuracy and I think that this could compromise my position.
929,27,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now that his c pawn moved this works.
930,27,9,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Forgetting that I got the colors reversed I continue behind the fianchetto plan as black generally does on the opposite side.
931,27,10,Qa4+,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/Q1PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I don't see the point of this move because I'm going to harass the Queen and then use that time to continue with my development by pinning his Nc3.
932,27,11,a3,b'rn1qk2r/p1p2ppp/1pb1pn2/3p4/1bPP4/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',A common move but I would've answered with 8.Bd2  It's now a question of to exchange or not but after what Ken mentioned in my last annotation combined with what happened in our game similarly I refuse.  And instead of the most common retreat which is on a5 I don't want to chance the loss of tempo as it would happen on our next move.  So I go back b6 which is a similar idea to what was mentioned when he said going to back to b2.  The idea being is that after 9.b4 I can and will castle at once.
933,27,12,1c5,b'rn1q1rk1/p1p2ppp/1pbbpn2/2Pp4/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/2Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',It's at the cost of tempo which to me is well worth it since my monarch is safe.  I considered exchanging but figured that my pawns were useful.  So I decided to go back e7 but this is was a bad as 10...Be7?! is going to lose several tempii with the attacks that are coming.
934,27,13,1Bd3,b'rn1qbrk1/p1p1bppp/1pP1pn2/1P1p4/3P4/P1NBPN2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',As now Bernnie's able to continue developing with a good spot for his LSB whereas my LSB however is misplaced in my opinion.
935,27,14,1a6,b'rn1qbrk1/2p1bppp/ppP1pn2/1P1p4/3P4/P1NBPN2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Unlike before my idea of a good time is exchanging pawns for a semi open file which is very useful.
936,27,15,1Ng5,b'rn1qbrk1/2p1bppp/ppP1pn2/1P1p2N1/3P4/P1NBP3/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Not surprisingly as I saw in a similar plan from Ken Bernnie declines with this nasty threat.  Which I see.  It's easy to miss because my Nf6 does something but not enough since there's two defenders against three attackers with the third being his Queen.  So I have to defend against the threat first.
937,27,16,1O-O,b'rn1qbrk1/2p1bp1p/ppP1pnp1/1P1p2N1/3P4/P1NBP3/2Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',After which he castles.
938,27,17,1Qd6,b'rn2brk1/2p1bp1p/ppPqpnp1/1P1p2N1/3P4/P1NBP3/2Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Then I come up with a similar plan to him.
939,27,18,1Bb2,b'rn2brk1/2p1bp1p/ppPqpnp1/1P1p2N1/3P4/P1NBP3/1BQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Continuing with his development but this is when I take advantage of the opportunity to exchange for the open file.  The only reason for this goal is because of what TA emphasized in one of his Q sac blitz games being that the semi open files are very important.  The bad part is that I'm going to get a little more then I asked for.  As per the saying ""be careful for what you wish for"" as I counted my chickens before they hatched here."
940,27,19,1Nxb5,b'rn2brk1/2p1bp1p/1pPqpnp1/1N1p2N1/3P4/P2BP3/1BQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Since I forgot that in the line my Queen would be attacked.  Now I'm thinking very hard and even clinging about what to do.  I don't want to exchange pieces yet because I might need them.  But what I'm paranoid about is my Be7 as it's crammed.  What I'm worried about is that he plays a4 followed by Ba3 and then I lose a piece after Ba3.  And that would be my Be7.  So I felt that there was no choice but to exchange.  The problem is the opposite of what I had against Ken this time around.  As I thought about too many variations.  It turns out that there were things in that line which could've stopped.  So 17...Qd8 would've been my best move.  By playing what I did I think that he's already getting an advantage because looking into the end I could've used one of my Bishops and my Q.  That's because once the Queens are off I'm going to be forced to exchange my Be8 in order to avoid the loss of a Rook which is the one thing that I didn't want.  At least one of them could've helped me out in the end.  And If I could read it all in one week I'd borrow that book based on what Ken outlined.  I think it's Youfan's book on endgames where he mentions about exchanging.  What I'm considering though is googling it or going into the library in the quiet area on occasion to study.  I'm also considering it borrowing if I go away and have to travel by plane as that's where I could also study this.  With that being said although it's not the decisive blunder it is in my opinion where I start to go wrong. 
941,27,20,Bd6,b'2r1r1k1/5p1p/1pnbpnp1/1B1p2N1/3P4/P3P3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? This is however the losing blunder.  According to Bernnie this is the only mistake that I made.  To an extent I agree with him but now that this wasn't the only flaw.  Exchanging Queens was the first inaccuracy that leads to Rome since afterwards I was forced to give up my stronger bishop thus losing the exchange.  That would've been needed in the endgame.  But by playing this he can and will attack my N a second piece.  At best I'm losing a Rook for B.  The worst is if the N didn't move at which he'd have a free piece.  Well I'm not going so I'll retreat in one of the few places that doesn't give my opponent a free piece.  As Ken told me when we get in a situation like this then it becomes trying to minimize the damage which is true here.
942,27,21,2Nf3,b'4r1k1/4np1p/1p1bpnp1/3p4/3P4/P3PN2/1B3PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Stopping the threat of 24...Ng4 followed by 25...Bxh2+ which I calculated but wasn't surprised to see this as it also came into calculation.
943,27,22,2Nf5,b'4r1k1/5p1p/1p1bpnp1/3p1n2/3P4/P3PN2/1B3PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',After which I come up with a different plan.  I don't like exchanges now but felt that similar to Ken there was no choice because his N posed as a tremendous threat.  So I'll wait but when we reach a critical position with overwhelming pressure that's when I feel that an exchange will be needed.  Unlike with Ken Bernnie is going to allow it but I hold back until it's needed (a court of last resort needless to say).
944,27,23,2a4,b'4r1k1/5p1p/1p1bpnp1/3p1n2/P2P4/4PN2/1B3PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Advancing his pawn.  The idea is attempting to get a passed pawn.
945,27,24,2Ra8,b'r5k1/5p1p/1p1bpnp1/3p1n2/P2P4/4PN2/1B3PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',And I try to stop it with this move.
946,27,25,2Ba3,b'r5k1/5p1p/1p1bpnp1/3p1n2/P2P4/B3PN2/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',But Bernnie has an answer to that as now he's threatening to exchange Bishops.
947,27,26,2Bb8,b'rb4k1/5p1p/1p2pnp1/3p1n2/P2P4/B3PN2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',However I decline to avoid further liquidation since I'm behind.
948,27,27,2Bb4,b'rb4k1/5p1p/1p2pnp1/3p1n2/PB1P4/4PN2/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Which grants him back the open file.
949,27,28,2Ng4,b'rb4k1/5p1p/1p2p1p1/3p1n2/PB1P2n1/4PN2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Since he moved his Bishop I decide to move the N.  Now we're reaching a critical as I'm getting ready to exchange should it be needed.  I'm optimistic at the moment but know that something is going to happen which I don't like.
950,27,29,2g3,b'rb4k1/5p1p/1p2p1p1/3p1n2/PB1P2n1/4PNP1/5P1P/R1R3K1 b - -',Stopping any plan I might have still had on h2.  Right now there's not but I was planning to in an attempt for counterplay.  I was trying to formulate a plan to kick his Nf3 in order to take on h2.  It certainly wasn't going to be easy but the plan is now exploited with this move.
951,27,30,2Ba7,b'r5k1/b4p1p/1p2p1p1/3p1n2/PB1P2n1/4PNP1/5P1P/R1R3K1 w - -',So I come up with another plan by trying to take away Bernnie's semi open file with this move as now my DSB is in the way of his Ra1 and a4 pawn.
952,27,31,2Ne5,b'r5k1/b4p1p/1p2p1p1/3pNn2/PB1P2n1/4P1P1/5P1P/R1R3K1 b - -',Putting stop to that by attacking my Ng4 which I must protect.
953,27,32,3Nc6,b'r5k1/b4p1p/1pN1pnp1/3p1n2/PB1P4/4P1P1/5P1P/R1R3K1 b - -',Trying to exchange my Ba7.  But this is where I feel that there is no choice but to allow it.  So I try to calculate a different plan with my next move.  The reason for this exchange is an attempt to play ...b5 with the idea of getting a passed pawn.  Not to my surprise though Bernnie stops that.  It starts off with a series of checks which to me were not worrisome since I deemed them as a nuisance.  I felt that he was just trying to cost me tempo which I wasn't going to fall for.  But the tempii is key and those checks are nasty as we'll see later on since he does something afterwards.
954,27,33,3Kg2,b'2R2B2/r4p1p/1p2pkp1/3p1n2/P2Pn3/4P1P1/5PKP/R7 b - -',This is why I deemed those checks as just annoying because there's no immediate win yet that I knew of.  But there's much more to the story then meets the eye.
955,27,34,3b5,b'2R2B2/r4p1p/4pkp1/1p1p1n2/P2Pn3/4P1P1/5PKP/R7 w - -',And this is why I felt that it was necessary to exchange my R for B and why I found those checks to be a waist of time.  If he takes I'll get a Rook for free and compensate for everything.  I knew that he wouldn't take.  But if Bert doesn't take I'll get a pawn in return which would become a passed pawn.  So despite being at -2 I felt that I've pulled a swindle as Bernnie's position seemed almost hopeless.  And I took his next move into consideration.  But I felt that it would more or less even out the game which means that I might be able to hold a draw with best play.  That's not so because my opponent keeps his winning edge after the next move.
956,27,35,Nd2,b'2R2B2/r4p1p/4pkp1/Pp1p1n2/3P4/4P1P1/3n1PKP/R7 w - -',This is why I figured that black might be able to get a draw as I'm threatening to fork his Ra1 and a5.
957,27,36,3Ra2,b'2R2B2/r4p1p/4pkp1/Pp1p1n2/3P4/4P1P1/R2n1PKP/8 b - -',But this is where I also found out otherwise since that won't work with this attack.  And it is the one move that I did not calculate after 31.Nxa7 and 35.a5 since that was one of the variations that I calculated.
958,27,37,3Bb4,b'2R5/r4p1p/4pkp1/Pp1p1n2/1BnP4/4P1P1/R4PKP/8 b - -',Protecting his a5.  Although I knew he'd win this is where I discovered that I'm lost.  In fact resignation is almost imminent.  The only reason for not resigning is because I felt that there was a little more to learn here.
959,27,38,3Nfd6,b'2R5/r4p1p/3npkp1/Pp1p4/1BnP4/4P1P1/R4PKP/8 w - -',Knowing that I decide to exchange but now it becomes something similar to Hope Chess even though the term is not correct here.  But what I'm hoping for is that Bernie blunders after we exchange which would turn things around as then I'd be able to get a passed pawn.  I felt that exchanging his Bb4 which is blocking my b5 was the way to go.
960,27,39,Rb7,b'8/1r3p1p/3npkp1/PpRp4/3P4/4P1P1/R4PKP/8 w - -',If I advanced right away 40...Rb2 would've stopped it.  However his next move shows that my position will not hold.  In fact what follows which will enable 41.a7 is the reason that I shouldn't have exchanged Queens.  As noted once that happened I was then forced to exchange Bishops which enabled 40.a6 in itself which is the dangerous pawn.  That's because were my LSB still around his passed pawn wouldn't have been able to advance this far.  And the only reason for exchanging unlike with previous games I didn't want to do it.  But I felt that there was no choice with a variation of losing a piece.  So what I learned is to calculate more carefully.  In other words to be more careful in my analysis because there were ways to keep things safe without the exchange.  Problem is something that Ken noted in previous annotations being that I did not consider enough moves. 
961,27,40,Ra8,b'r7/P4p1p/3npkp1/1pRp4/3P4/4P1P1/R4PKP/8 w - -',I figured that his pawn was blocked and thus hoping it was the best that Bernie could do.  However that does not happen as we're about to see.
962,27,41,4Rb6,b'r3n3/P4p1p/1R2pkp1/1p1p4/3P4/4P1P1/R4PKP/8 b - -',"This however is where I resigned.  Up until now I felt that there was more to learn and that I could still try to make things difficult for him just like with Ken once I lost my Queen for Rook.  After this move however not only won't that work but there is nothing else to learn.  So felt that there was no point in continuing because Bernnie will play 44.Rb8 which is the reason behind this move.  After Bernnie plays that he'll either promote or I'll be forced to give up my Rook for a pawn on top of what I've lost.  After this game we analyzed this a little and he said that the opening was what did me in.  By this though he was implying 21...Bd6?? which is actually the middle game.  According to him I was flawless except for that but it was enough to lose.  I don't agree about being flawless because of my faulty decision to exchange Queens after which I didn't have my LSB which could've been used to stop this promotion.  What it boiled down to was me not considering enough moves of what would've happens becomes something which isn't instructive for this game but in life as well.  As the saying goes ""Don't count your chickens before they hash.""  And on top of that inaccuracy I think doing this is what also led to my fatal blunder.  "
963,28,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The queen's left the game early and a good battle ensued.  There was also a king move which may not be what would be expected.  Also the game looked to be good for white at around move 34/35 but was black defeated.  I think I used my king more than I have in any game so far and not just left him to his fate.

I think at this stage the game is quite even.  Same number of pieces and we both have a pawn chain with a piece on the opponents part of the board.  White does have a strong centre and my pawns are connected and can cause a problem to white on the king side.

I continue to attack the king by pushing my h pawn to h5 and attack the pawn at g3.  At present I am down 2 points I only have one rook but I have 3 pieces; a pair of bishops and knight against black's bishop and knight and 2 rooks.  But I have 6 pawns whilst white has 6 pawns with doubled pawns on e file.

White's move has blocked the b file which white may have thought would stop my rook coming down to attack the king.  Meanwhile I capture white's pawn at g3 so I have a pawn protecting my f2 pawn plus my LB at h3 is protecting the queening square.

So LB came to d5 and checked the king and I moved the king to f6 and there should be no more problems from the LB as king is now on a dark square and also LB has his own pawns blocking his path to protect the king.

1055,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Not wanting to experiment with what I'm not used to I stick to 1.e4.
1056,30,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',?! Loyd however responds with this move.  It's dubious and inaccurate because that f pawn is at risk.  Not to mention that he could've used that time to advance his central pawn or develop a piece.  
1057,30,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I go right ahead of it by developing in the way that I'm used to since this is characteristic when you take into account the Spanish Opening and Open Sicilian.  Better however might have been 2.e5 as that puts his weakest pawn at risk.  We either get rid of it by exchanging which would put him at a disadvantage.  Or Loyd advances it which makes his position difficult.
1058,30,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n2p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Loyd now develops.

1063,30,8,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2p1n/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I plan to exchange his N for B because of what is about to follow.  I am analyzing a variation where exchanging is going to make it possible.  Sure enough that variation is going to become a reality because I'm treating it as though Loyd played the Domiano Defense since he played 1...f6.
1064,30,9,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2p1n/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Continuing with his development.  But now I follow up on my plan.  For once I exchange I take on e5 and that is followed by a check just like with what I mentioned being 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5 fxe5 and then 4.Qh5+  
1065,30,10,Bd4,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp2pp/2p2p1n/4N3/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Instead of taking back however he played this.  But my next move is still going to be the same with the idea of exposing his K.  In fact the K exposure was my long term plan behind exchanging on c6.
1066,30,11,g6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp3p/2p2ppn/4N2Q/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Calculating this move but forgetting about my Ne5 attacked.  In this case however it means little if anything to me because I just take on h6.  That way when he takes my Ne5 I haven't lost anything and although not as strong as before I still feel that I've got an advantage.
1067,30,12,1Qg7,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp2Qp/2p2pp1/4b3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',And that's because of this move.  As now he must defend his Rook.

1070,30,15,1Qe7,b'r1b1kr2/p1ppq1Qp/2p2pp1/4b3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQq -',Which not to my surprise Loyd stops.  That's when I use that time to liquidate Queens due to being a pawn up.  I also could've played 12.Qh6 but I don't where that could get me.  Unlike before I exchange since it's possible.  Normally I'd follow Ken's advice due to being told not to.  The difference between this and a regular game is time management.  Where there more time I would've brought my Queen to h6 because of that pawn.  But when you don't have much time you've got to do what you think is best based on instinct.  And my next move came to mind.  After the exchange I then use that time to castle since this was planned which brought me to that second variation.
1071,30,16,Kf7,b'r1b2r2/p1pp1k1p/2p2pp1/4b3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',At first I wasn't sure but after further analysis I determined that he played this.

1075,30,20,1Rb8,b'1rb1r3/p1pp1k1p/2p2ppB/4b3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Afterwhich he attacks my b2.
1076,30,21,1d4,b'1rb1r3/p1pp1k1p/2p2ppB/4b3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',"So I counterattack his Be5.  The idea is that I play this move as though it were the Spanish Opening.  That's because I learned from reversion that ""the c2-d4 plan"" which is c2-c3 followed by d2-d4 is a theme.  As the idea is tempo gain by attacking the bishop.  Therefore I'm applying that same concept but through a different opening."
1077,30,22,1Bd6,b'1rb1r3/p1pp1k1p/2pb1ppB/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Which Loyd protects.  Afterwhich I protect my b pawn.
1078,30,23,Bb4,b'1rb1r3/p1pp1k1p/2p2ppB/8/1b1PP3/1PN5/P1P2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',But what I didn't realize is that Loyd will equalize since I'm going to lose a different pawn.  That's because Loyd has removed the guard since my Nc2 was the only thing that was protecting my e4.  Now that I'm forced to remove it from that square black will take go for it by nabbing that pawn.
1079,30,24,1Rfe1,b'1rb5/p1pp1k1p/2p2ppB/8/1b1Pr3/1P6/P1P1NPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',?? My idea behind a good time was centralizing my other Rook.  But this is a blunder as Loyd could win my Re1 for his Bb4 with the immediate 19...Bxe1.
1080,30,25,1Ba6,b'1r6/p1pp1k1p/b1p2ppB/8/1b1Pr3/1P6/P1P1NPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',! But this move is even stronger as now he's going to at the very least win a piece without compensation of any sort.  It wasn't here but right after I resigned.  That is once I had played 20.Ng3  Loyd didn't even have the chance to respond as I threw in the towel.  Just before that Jack analyzed it and figured it out.  However with the time crunch Loyd said that he would've missed this opportunity because he was about to play 20...c5 which I understand.  As I made this blunder due to us almost being out of time.  After analysis Jack Loyd and I all played through variations.  I resigned because of what I thought would've occurred which Jack showed that Loyd could do with an overwhelming advantage.  Given that 20.Ng3 was played it could've continued with 20...Bxe1 21.Rxe1 Rxe1 and white is down to a Rook without compensation.  In fact those moves are check so we all of us overlooked a mate that follows after which is the same but 21.Rxe1 21...Rxe1+ 22.Nf1 (forced) 22...Rxf1# which is more of a reason that I'm down a Rook after 20...Bxe1 since I cannot take back.  Therefore there would've been nothing else to get out of the game.  As noted the reason I said could've as opposed to would've is that Loyd had 20...c5 in mind and told me that he would have missed that move due to the same factor that led to my downfall.  But I did not miss it after seeing the blunders that were made.  When we were saying goodbye to each other (so about 10 minutes after this game) Jack said that next week he didn't want to me to play against Loyd again since we're both good player.  Instead he either wanted me or him to play against Mariann and Jack Stockel would play against the other player.  There's no definite since things change but it's tentative.  If however it becomes a reality and I'm paired with Mariann I'll coach her.  But what I'm hoping for is to be paired up against Jack Stockel for another training game since I miss the one on one coaching with him.
1081,31,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Loyd's style is the Philidor's Defense.  So I stick to the mainline for now.
1082,31,1,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4pb2/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?? However you usually exchange on d4 right away.  I'm not sure how he thought but my guess is that Loyd wanted to try something different.  I understand that all too well since I like doing different things.  In fact that's why I chose 1.d4 as opposed to 1.e4 in my training game against Kenneth_fiore_3 because he played the KID against me.  It was good to learn because my student pagmatic64 wanted practice there.  So this gave me a way to do so since I knew how to play it.  But it is however a blunder here.  That's because my opponent overlooked that I could take.  My opponent implied that he didn't see my e4.  Jack Stockel has (with his glaucoma) occasionally overlooked something like this in his expertise analysis.  But in doing so I'm not going to miss my chance of getting a piece here. 
1083,31,2,exd4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/5P2/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now he goes back to something similar to mainlines.  But this was best a move earlier.  Now we can exchange but he'll still remain a piece down since I'm going back.
1084,31,3,Qe7+,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/5P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I'm not sure why he played this right away.  But in doing so I'm going to block the check right away with the Queen.  As now by playing this I'm going to liquidate Queens due to being ahead.  Not to mention that when I take back I'll be one step closer to castling since I will recapture with my Bf1.
1085,31,4,Nf6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/5P2/3N4/8/PPP1BPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Continuing with his development which I anticipated.
1086,31,5,Bb5+,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/1B3P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',As I place him in check.  The idea being is that Loyd is in a difficult situation and I was interested in how he'd respond.  The idea behind this was putting pressure against him.  Of course he has 8...c6 and then I drive back.  One idea here was to find a better post for my Bishop as I felt semi cramped.  But one goal is to put pressure on your opponent.  I think that better would've been 8.Bc4 to prevent the possibility of him playing 8...c6  But the other move I calculated is what happens next as the idea is continuing with his development.  After he does that...
1087,31,6,O-O,b'rn2kb1r/pppn1ppp/3p4/1B3P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',I castle at once.  But the idea here was more then just K safety which is in general the only reason for me playing this.  In this situation this was also played because of what Loyd does next.  It does confirm my instinct about him wanting to continue with his development.
1088,31,7,1Re1,b'rn2k2r/pppnbppp/3p4/1B3P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',But it enables me to pin his Be7.  The pin although not serious yet is a burden for Loyd and increases the pressure.
1089,31,8,1c5,b'rn2k2r/pp1nbppp/3p4/1Bp2P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq c6',So he kicks my N.  
1090,31,9,1Bc6,b'rn2k2r/pp1nbppp/2Bp4/2p2P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',"?? With the idea of liquidating while ahead followed by winning a piece (which happens later) I played this.  But what I overlooked until viewing it here is that is a terrible blunder that should lose my advantage at once.  As now he can equalize.  And when Jack makes a mistake in his analysis it's similar to this move since he has missed a pawn or a piece where it could be taken or defended.  As noted it's rare with Jack but quite common with me.  This needs to stop because when commenting on another student known as superandy before playing him I did it quite often which repeated in our game.  I had to be corrected by so many players that the annotation wound up getting deleted by Andy himself.  Then it occurred in our training where I wound up blundering my Queen and getting a lucky win.  It was so serious that after seeing a mistake that ION made in his game with knightrider62 I had to bring it up.  With that being said although what I have isn't serious this blunder was most certainly affiliated with my disability.  That's because what I have causes me to misunderstand or overanalyze things.  In this context I overanalyzed what GM Susan Polgar mentioned in her book ""Chess Tactics for Champions"" in the second chapter under pins which involves pinning motifs and it included a couple of Homework questions.  The idea was similar to what will happen here.  You pin a piece and an attacker to the pin.  By doing so you tie down the opponents piece and consequently win it.  But that sort of thing doesn't happen when you have a situation like this.  In this context it's his b7 which were it not there this would be a very effective.  Now as per Ken's advice I was calculating several variations but overlooked what Loyd could and ought to have responded which would have equalized."
1091,31,10,1Nxc6,b'r3k2r/pp1nbppp/2np4/2p2P2/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq -',As this was the move that I calculated but best was 11...bxc6.  By playing this I liqudate but once again I similarly overlooked a move that still enables him to equalize.
1092,31,11,Ne5,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/2Np4/2p1nP2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq -',As this is what I analyzed.  In other words I was thinking along several lines when playing 11.Bc6?? which should've taken away my advantage.  And after taking back this was also the move that I calculated.  But best was still 12...bxc6.  By playing this that chance is gone.  As now the best that Loyd can get now is exchanging which is to my benefit since I now remain ahead throughout the remainder of this game.
1093,31,12,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/3p4/2p1NP2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',?? The idea was getting the monarch to safety which is why you castle.  I did analyze it but unlike before I did not think he was going to play this.  Instead I thought that he would play the best move which would've been 14...dxe5 as then my next move would be 15.Rxe5 leaving me up a pawn and piece.  By playing this Loyd is faced with an overwhelming amount of pressure on Loyd.  And I will remain ahead by two pieces u[ without compensation.  Those two things was the entire plan behind 11.Bc6.
1094,31,13,Rae8,b'4rrk1/pp1Nbppp/3p4/2p2P2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',?? I was interested in how Loyd would respond to the pressure.  However we temporarlely lost power.  I think that's why he played this.  Best would been 14...Rfe8 because had he moved anything else I would've gotten another free piece.  But this was almost as blunderous because I get a Rook for N which is almost an equivalent.  On the other hand I can understand this blunder as he as well as others were distracted by the outage.  Jack I believe could not see too well.  In the past I was distracted and would've been were it not for this calculation.  But after he castled and I played 14.Nd7 I calculated variations including this one.  And It happened just before the outage which made me immune to the distraction.  On top of that I have extremely good vision which enabled me to see the board even when it was a bit dark.  So I knew what to do.

1097,31,16,1Nd5,b'3r1k2/pp2bppp/3p4/2pN1P2/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',But Loyd resigned here.  That's because on top of being where we are I'm about to liquidate further.  In this case I'm going to exchange his Be7 for my Nd5.  Under these conditions black realized that he had no chance and threw in the towel.  After which Jack analyzed to see if resignation was premature.  We did calculate a variation which my coach knew would still be liquidation but wanted to know if Loyd stood a chance afterwards.  So we analyzed what would happen 17...Bf6 18.Nxf6 gxf6  On top of remaining that far ahead his pawn structures surrounding the monarch would be destroyed.  And we figured out that black cannot save the position.  Therefore Mr. Stockel determined that resignation isn't premature here.  When the game was over my opponent told me that I played extremely well which at the time I agreed with before posting it on this website.  Another look shows that I didn't because as noted 11.Bc6 was a terrible move which could've allowed Loyd to fully compensate.  Even if at the time I saw it and disagreed I still thanked him because I appreciate compliments and also I don't want anyone feeling offended and have no way of not doing it unless I show my gratitude.  However in the aftermath of this game Jack gave advice to Loyd.  It was to slow down and take more time.  Although I don't like saying it or seeming too harsh I have to agree with that assessment.  For example after I played 11.Bc6 11...Nxc6 was played quickly.  In other words black didn't give it enough time.  The same thing happened when he played 12...Ne5 as opposed to 12...bxc6  On top of that Loyd followed that advice in our next two games and won in both of them which I'll be annotating later in the week when time allows.

But I wouldn't have gone for this exchange only because of Kenneth_fiore_3 outlined which is not to exchange for the thrills of it.  The reason I say this is were I to go for an exchange it would just be because I could.  So there has to be more to this that I'm missing.  However reversion is going to go along with the exchange plan.

This also develops and gives you a good place to do that without the loss of tempo either.  Mike: Most of the blitz game has white controlling the left side of the board. So this a bit of a learning curve  With the pawns I meant.  Joe: It all depends on the position. I'd say that with the KID that is what you want. But the difference is that they're playing fast. In games like this it's long correspondence. So you take the time and see where you get from there.

He mentioned that it's generally not a good idea to do two fianchettos in the KID.  But that is what I did here to give my student a challenge since he doesn't expect. In fact that will be mentioned on the next move.  My idea is getting him used to something that he hasn't seen before.  The goal is pressure because of what Ken noted which I mentioned later on.  It's about making things difficult for the student so that they really need to struggle and figure out the best move.

Joe: Yes because it wasn't possible with the second fianchetto which you don't typically see in the KID. I changed things up. But were I to stick with mainlines and play 6.e3 and then you answered with 6...Bg4 I would've broken that pin at once with 7.Be2.  Part of the idea behind that comment was something that Ken mentioned which is the question well what if I played something different.  He did that to get me aware of multiple threats so what I'm saying is that it wouldn't work because of this.  The idea is getting Mike to calculate multiple as opposed to only one variation which is a common problem.

It's similar to a variation (introduced by Susan Polgar) that you see in the French Defense but it works here.  Mike: I considered fianchtto the bishop. But I didn't have much developed  in case I got attacked.  Joe: Yes developing your pieces early is in general a good idea. On the other hand there are exceptions to those guidelines. What it boils down is when to deviate from the guidelines. In general that happens when you're a dealing with a nasty threat and must do it to answer the threat.  Now that comment was based on what I learned from ""he who must not be named.""  But the fact is true guidelines are just guidelines.  But the overall story is that sometimes you must deviate from them to save the position or prevent trouble which is the logic behind this conversation. "

It's about knowing what the opponent can do.  Mike: Exactly.  Even though that was a good idea I later had to edit the comment because where he moved it was a mistake.  So later on even though I said it was a mistake with the idea of losing something I calculated a line that would've given him a pawn back.  So what I later said was that it was inaccurate because it would still cause problems.  If he wanted to see where I might capture better would've been 7...Nb4 or 7...Nb8.

I wanted to set up an attack via putting the knight bak to d6. I know I'm opened to an attack.  This is the part when I think too much   I think you'll bring kb2. I was thinking putting your bishop to e5. See what happens.  Edit kb3  Joe: Well it is good to think ahead. But you don't want to do too much at one time. That's true.  Mike: Which is why I took the knight. I'm not developed to make one of my signature crazy moves lol.  Joe:  I figured that you took. The other move I thought about was the possibility of 8...Ne4. But then I'd answer with 9.Nc6 and put pressure. That's the move that might have protected the pawn. But by taking black loses a pawn now because I'm going to capture on e5.

But as previously noted I wanted to give something else to think about.  By doing this there is more pressure and we're approaching a more difficult position here.  I'm interested in how he handles this.  The idea is making things more difficult as a bigger problem which Ken outlined.  But this is a mistake from my side as this gets him a pawn back.  Mike: No I don't want your pawn on d5  The king side castle is getting cluttered  Joe: That is true.

Much better was to exchange with 11.Bxf6  Instead I was fixated on being a pawn up but missed what the board was trying to tell me here as now he is going to win my Rook with a discovered and leaving me with the pressure.  This blunder though was caused by the rough week I had at work that I noted to Ken since I was also rilded up.  Which makes the second game that a work situation led to a terrible blunder.

Mike: Putting my pawn on e6 was a big mistake.  Joe: Yes I think what you calculated was that I'd take then Bishop takes back and then we have the Queen exchange. And I almost did that. But I advanced it a square further to compromise the position. After which white wound up ahead.  Now I said this to alleviate the problems that I caused for myself with that terrible of capturing on d6 as opposed to f6.  Mike:  I regret a couple moves. I'm confused. Do I have a chance?  Joe: You do.  By that I'm saying that he should not resign and implying that I'm in trouble to make life easier on my student so that he gains confident.  This is one way that I used to show lienency before finding out that I had to be cruel.  Here: I'm saying that he shouldn't give up and Jack Stockel used similar methods with me which is actually how I became a good player and starting teaching chess before becoming a 1200 rated player since my lowest rating was 851.

Ok so let's go back to what you mentioned about ...e6  You're plan on that 9th move with the Queen's facing each other I believe was 10.dxe6 because of 10...Qxe1 11.Qxe1 The idea behind exchanging those Queens is on top of the loss of castling rights my monarch is misplaced in the aftermath. However I wasn't going to enable to that so I had played 10.d6 advancing that pawn one square. Then however I took d6 with the Bishop which was a mistake as it was then that you were going to get my Rook. Yes I took that Rook before but better was to exchange N for B on f6. But after getting my Rook your Ng4 was en-prise. So I did get a N in return. There's still plenty to fight for and the position is not beyond saving yet.  Mike: I agree.  I feel stuck.

And as I recently learned from a chess coach pressure is about not knowing what to do. Mike: I'm feeling the pressure.  Joe:  Yes this has become a very difficult position. By not taking you wound up another pawn down. But what I recently learned is that a coach's job is to make the position more difficult as then it's up to the student to figure out what to do from there.

Although I didn't want to say it I think that resignation is no longer premature. A pawn is a pawn but now you're down a piece and pawn without compensation. I could start a new one when time allows.  Thus he resigned here.  What I didn't mention was the moral because this was at the end of the rough week.  But it's something that I earlier this year learned from Jack Stockel.  That is to take more time in the endgame.  If you make a mistake in the opening or midgame you usually can get out of it.  However one mistake in the endgame usually means the end of the Rome as what happened here.

Note that if Bxe5 (threatening the rook) Qe7 allows for some play and a possible discovered check queen grab in exchange for a rook.  In retrospect Nxe4 is likely better because at worst it lets me trade queens and and best I get some significant material advantage.

This board will favor bishops and it would be worth the effort to offer an exchange.  The d6 pawn is very weak and needs some protection.

Figuring that it was at a bad time and that he missed the story that the board was trying to tell him I took without thinking twice about it.  But this is a blunder that should've lost a piece for pawn.  Just about anything is better.  Normally I don't say anything afterwards if it's someone of my strength or not as strong.  He's stronger so I'm fortunate and happy (even if not supposed to be) that he didn't spot it.  The only move I was calculating was what comes to my fixation on exchanges as this was before my game with Ken.  And what I calculated became a reality as now it appears that his K side will be destroyed.  But taking was just bad as this could and ought to have failed.

As far as I was concerned it was an inaccuracy.  As now I'm more focused on exchanging pieces since I'm ahead.  What I didn't know until that blunder which Ted missed is that it's not a good idea.  Since in that game I overlooked that he could've won a piece.  My assumption was that I had an edge and that I'd try to capitalize on that as per Susan Polgar's advice.
1197,35,15,1c3,b'r2qr1k1/1ppb1p1p/p2b1p1B/8/1n1P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I attack his N keeping that exchange in mind which is going to become a reality.

As I had 14...Qe7 15.Rae1 Rd8 16.Qd2 but then black left his Queen vulnerable and I failed to take his Queen.  Well that didn't happen as not only didn't Loyd leave his Queen en-prise.
1199,35,17,Bxh4,b'4b2k/1p3p1p/p7/3P4/2r4b/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 w - -',So in a case like that all that matters is how long the game lasted and what happened.  It was 28 moves and in the end I wound up losing at least a piece and pawn which was enough for me to resign as there was nothing else to learn from the game.  In the actual game though I lost a piece as well as my Queen without compensation which is why I resigned.  The moral isn't what's in the annotation itself but rather in the actual annotation.  And what it boils down is how I actually lost a piece.  The problem was that I had my B and Queen tied down which is how he won that.  So the lesson to be learned is what I learned a while ago.  It's not a good to tie down and restrict your own pieces.  As that gives you problems which your opponent can exploit.
1200,36,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The first two moves is a common them for me as white.  But he played the Philidor's Defense.
1201,36,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I stick to mainlines for now.

So my attitude is trade pieces when possible.  However one reason here that didn't occur in that training game is that when all is said and done Loyd will lose his right to castle.  But that's a minor thing as I'm about to find out.
1204,36,4,Bc4,b'rnb2b1r/pp2kppp/5n2/2p1N3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Figuring that I already have an initiative I continue with my development to enable castling on my next move.
1205,36,5,1O-O,b'rn3b1r/pp2kppp/4bn2/2p1N3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',While not the main one since it's about K safety I anticipated 9...Be6 in the aftermatch of my playing 9.Bc4  Therefore the idea was to exchange pieces early.  Now had this been after the training game that wouldn't have been my attitude.

Come to think of it I now remember something that archduke_piccolo said which is that the loss of castling rights is minor.
1209,36,9,1Re1,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2p5/2N5/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',Remaining calm but figuring that I still have an initiative I centralize my Rook as it is a way to control the center.

Instead of retreating back to d2 (which I should've done) I decide to place him in check without giving this enough thought.  As now he is going to win my N.  The thing is that I did calculate a variation (which you see on my next move).  But the bad news is that I didn't see what came after which is multiple variations.  Yes I'll get a pawn back but I was calculating the win of a piece back to wind up a pawn ahead.  Well that only works with one move which Loyd isn't going to allow.  At best I'm going to wind up the equivalent to two pawns down.  
1212,36,12,Kd7,b'r6r/p2k1ppp/2nb1n2/1pB5/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',That's because in the variation the only move that came to mind was 15...Kd8  In other words that's the only thing I calculated as opposed to other responses.  As now I'm in trouble.
1213,36,13,1Rd1,b'r6r/p2k1ppp/2nb1n2/1pB5/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN1R2K1 b - -',Figuring however that I'd get something back I decide to attack his Bishop.  The idea is pressure as I figured that Loyd would have no idea what to do and as Ken mentioned in our discussion that's what pressure is all about.  With that being said (since it was before) I didn't know it was pressure so the idea was making it so that Loyd wouldn't know what to do.  But I'm in for a rude awakening.
1214,36,14,1Ne4,b'r6r/p2k1ppp/2nb4/1pB5/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1R2K1 w - -',With this move as his Bd6 (though still pinned) is now protected.
1215,36,15,1b4,b'r6r/p2k1ppp/2nb4/1pB5/1P2n3/8/P1P2PPP/RN1R2K1 b - b3',So I try to calculate another plan with support on my B.
1216,36,16,1Kc7,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/2nb4/1pB5/1P2n3/8/P1P2PPP/RN1R2K1 w - -',So Loyd breaks that pin with this move.
1217,36,17,1a4,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/2nb4/1pB5/PP2n3/8/2P2PPP/RN1R2K1 b - a3',? So I start getting really aggressive and become unsound.  But this is a mistake.  My idea was him taking the pawn as then I'd take back the piece or exchange and try to get back a pawn.  The problem is that I only calculated one as opposed to multiple variations since there's more then one threat.  I anticipated the next move but the variation only involved 19...Kxd6 which would've won back a pawn as opposed to 19...Nxd6 which is in his favor since Loyd is ahead.  I figured that I'd be able to get enough compensation which isn't so.
1218,36,18,2c3,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/3n4/1p6/Pn6/2P5/5PPP/RN1R2K1 b - -',So I attack his N in an attempt to get something back.
1219,36,19,2axb5,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/2nn4/1P6/8/2P5/5PPP/RN1R2K1 b - -',But now I have gotten a pawn.  But it doesn't compensate for what before since I'm still down by the equivalent of 2 as opposed to 1 pawn with my previous mistake.
1220,36,20,2Ne5,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/3n4/1P2n3/8/2P5/5PPP/RN1R2K1 w - -',Protecting his N to prevent me from getting anything else back.
1221,36,21,2Rd5,b'r6r/p1k2ppp/3n4/1P1Rn3/8/2P5/5PPP/RN4K1 b - -',Like before I'm trying to put Loyd in a situation where he doesn't know what to do.
1222,36,22,2Rhe8,b'r3r3/p1k2ppp/3n4/1P1Rn3/8/2P5/5PPP/RN4K1 w - -',But it doesn't work since he centralizes his Rook with a back rank mate threat that I'm about to overlook.
1223,36,23,2Ra5,b'r3r3/p1k2ppp/3n4/RP1Rn3/8/2P5/5PPP/1N4K1 b - -',?? Trying to put pressure on his a7 with the plan of 24.b6+  However were I successful this wouldn't have worked.  Without it being Hope Chess which I don't like too much either these days but with a very similar idea to what happened in my game against Ken I'm hoping that Loyd will blunder and allow me to compensate for lost material.  Not to my surprise though it won't work out.  In fact this attempt is a terrible blunder as now I'm going to lose my Rook without any compensation or get mated.  So by attempting this I miscalculated the multiple threats that white black which was part of the first lesson with Ken.  Much better was to open up by advancing the f g or h pawns.
1224,36,24,2Rc5+,b'r3r3/p1k2ppp/3n4/RPR5/2n5/2P5/5PPP/1N4K1 b - -',Figuring that I could still compensate however I place Loyd in check.  But this is now in reality a resignable position.
1225,36,25,2Rc6,b'r3r3/p2k1ppp/2Rn4/RP6/2n5/2P5/5PPP/1N4K1 b - -',Not knowing that I now think about trying to get a passed pawn.  But with this move however it's mate.
1226,36,26,2Re1#,b'r7/p2k1ppp/2Rn4/RP6/2n5/2P5/5PPP/1N2r1K1 w - -',"After which Jack got really angry with me.  That's because he's told me many times (mainly in our training games) to watch the King.  In fact he made note of that by yelling something like ""HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TELL YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR THE KING""  But I had a closer look at this and realized that there was not much else but to lose the Rook or have this happened and I only figured that out now.  So the first moral here is identical to the first lesson with Ken.  That's being aware of multiple as opposed to only one threat that the opponent has in stock.  But another good lesson which I previously learned from Jack is not to try anything fancy when you're in trouble or the opponent has the advantage which is what happened here.  Instead try to figure if you can still save the position and if so how."

1230,37,3,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',In my books he did not do it the right way as this does not develop or help control the center.  I think that better was to develop something.  As white I would've played 4.Nf3 or brought my Bf1 into play for the plan of castling short.
1231,37,4,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I try to take advantage with this move since it does bring me a step closer to castling.  I don't like the N here since it appears cramped.  But the only other alternative was to place my on the rim with 4...Nh6?? which could expose the K since Ted could punish this with 5.Bxh6 and after 5...gxh6 I'm in a lot of trouble.  However I also kept in mind something that Ken and Susan Polgar told me as there will be a better spot for my Ne7 to undue the cramped position.

Therefore I use that opportunity to get the N better placed as it appears.  But I overlooked something bigger.  This was a little fixation but what happens after Ted's next move?

The only other options were 6...Ne7 (but I didn't want my N cramped again.)  Or 6...Nh6 (but I didn't want to risk the K exposure.)  So this was played in anticipation of white's next move.  In other words 7.Nf3 was an equivalent to a conditional move since I know my opponent.

Not always but more often then not it's to one's benefit because of what happens in the endgame as will be the case here.  Therefore knowing that I can I just go for it and exchange Queens.

Since it's not a training game where it's my teacher I play whatever my instincts tell me to play.  And it was this move since I'm starting to formulate a plan for the pawn chain.  But better might have been 16...b5 as that chain is there.  I think that the best move however would've been 6...Nb6 as my N is better placed at once.  I guess what it boils down is that in situations like this since I've never considered this before to think of a regular game like a specific training game.  As training is practice.  It's about ""wake up and smell the coffee"" as tactical-abyss puts it since it's about reality. "

Similar to what happened with the game against dynamic_dv where I pin f7 since it happened in a different game and turned out to be a mistake something happened here.  Ok so instead of retreating I attacked something worth more.  The reason is because in some of charleshiggie's games he's attacked.  In other words his opponent attacks let's supposed his Bishop or Rook.  Instead of retreating he reattacked something worth more which was the Queen.  It worked.  But the problem is that I forgot something that Ken said way back in time which is that you have to base it on the position and not what was played in that game.  Not only did I forget that but I on the other hand completely disregarded the position almost as though it didn't matter.  That's not a good way to think but don't what Jack was talking about here.  I reanalyzed it and this time it works out.  So it was a good move but for the wrong reason.  Now Jack Stockel started watching this game and got interested due to me being a piece and pawn up early.  But he got upset me when I played this move.  Unlike other games he wasn't going to make us end and start a new game since he was playing a different game and Tom was bound to show up.  Don't be fooled however as he was just upset.  In fact it was enough for him to lose interest in this game as he was bound to walk away.  Don't know why but my guess is that Jack thought I threw away my advantage.  But I reanalyzed what was going here.  That's because if 20.Rxd3? 20...Nxd3 and if 20.bxc5?? 20...Bxb1
1255,37,28,2Rb2,b'r4rk1/p3bppp/1pp1p3/2n1P1P1/1P3P2/P1Nb3P/1R6/2BR2K1 b - -',"Jack however watched this move.  But afterwards he completely lost interested in our game.  In it Mr. Stockel accurately asked ""What are you doing Ted.""  In other words he rightly implied that my last move was a blunder that should've given him back a piece.  What he was accurately alluding to is the fact that best was 20.bxc5  Even more shocking is that when making the blunder I calculated through that line but overlooked something vital which is another reason for the blunder.  What I figured is ok 20.bxc5 and then I'll play 20...Rxd3 and it's still liquidation.  But I overlooked 21.cxb6 axb6 and then 22.Rxb6 and white has still got something back."

Because of what Jack originally thought which on Friday I agreed with due to a rough week I displayed what I'll call an impulsive act of Hope Chess which wasn't necessary. That's because Hope Chess is when your opponent has a nasty threat like this but instead of calculating you just hope that he or she doesn't spot it.  Yes I made a mistake and was just hoping that Ted wouldn't see this.  What I forgot is that he could win a piece as opposed to a pawn.  At first I thought that I was in danger of losing a piece and was hoping that I wouldn't lose it.  But it was a pawn as opposed to a piece that was in danger.  Now a piece is hanging.  However keeping in mind what Jack was saying I was hoping for something.  The way for Ted to win a piece (so the threat) is 21.Rxd3  But because of what my coach previously said I was praying that he'd overlook that and take my N so that I could then liquidate and remain a piece and pawn up.  I was lucky that it happened here.  On the other hand my thought process was quite bad and wouldn't have worked against more experienced player.  It was the combination of feeling a little rushed and impulsive after the way that Jack acted combined with the past two or three works day which turned rough.  So what happened with this move was essentially what I feared would occur in my game against Ken.  And that upsets as Ted could've won back a piece here.

But 22.Rd7 stopped as unlike before I am not going to blunder or make a mistake this time around.  And the reason behind this move as opposed to 22...Rae8 is that it will allow me to centralize my other Rook (bring the other rook to d8).

More importantly however I'm once again going to exchange due to being ahead.  Ted just doesn't realize.  On the other hand it is a mistake as Ted does win back a pawn.  Unlike before I am not bothered by this because no matter how you slice it's not as Ken put it there's not enough compensation which I happily keep at the front of my mind.  The reason for this was due to the Hope Chess that worked since that N was exchanged.  In doing so he's now left without enough pieces which is why it's generally a good idea to liquidate pieces when ahead.  If this however were a piece and he had more on the board like before it would be a different story.

Of course that was before the first lesson with Ken on when it's safe to exchange.  It still will happen where I occasionally make a mistake which is why instead of borrowing that book I'll try to google I believe it's You Fan's book on endgames based on if exchanging will work.  Back then when I wasn't too sure as is here I just go by what my instincts and nothing else.  In this case it was to exchange since Jack Stockel's advise was to exchange often against stronger players.  The big problem was that after the lesson I misunderstood the entire interpretation.  He didn't mean in general just because you can.  Instead Jack was specifically alluding to against Tom because Tom is the kind of player that likes to avoid exchanges which is how he often forces those wins.  One time I got a draw just by keeping that in mind when he made a blunder and lost the Queen for Rook.

Similar to my first game against a certain character my N is now cramped there.  That's because there will be not other squares available without losing the N.  The beginning of where not calculating enough causes problem.  But there's still plenty of fight.  It's not until much later on that I really go wrong.
1291,38,18,Ne6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p2pn3/2b1p2n/4P3/1PNQ3N/PBPP1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Presumably he wants to put pressure on my Nh3 and threaten a K exposure.
1292,38,19,1Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p2pn3/2b1p2n/4P3/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Which I stop by attacking his Nh5.
1293,38,20,1g6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/p2pn1p1/2b1p2n/4P3/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Protecting this is in an unusual matter since I thought that he would retreat.
1294,38,21,1Rae1,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/p2pn1p1/2b1p2n/4P3/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Feeling just a little bit of pressure I just go for it again by centralizing my Rook since that's generally a good idea.  The real question is if it works out in this position.  I think so since everything appears fine so far.
1295,38,22,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3p1p/p1ppn1p1/2b1p2n/4P3/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/4RRK1 w - -',I'm not sure why he played this.
1296,38,23,1Nd1,b'r2q1rk1/1p3p1p/p1ppn1p1/2b1p2n/4P3/1P3Q1N/PBPP1PPP/3NRRK1 b - -',Feeling that he'll try to pressure my N with ...Nd4 at some point due to the half pin I just bring it back before problems can arise.
1297,38,24,1Nhg7,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pnp/p1ppn1p1/2b1p3/4P3/1P3Q1N/PBPP1PPP/3NRRK1 w - -',Bringing his Nh5 to a better outpost.

1299,38,26,1f5,b'r2q1rk1/1p4np/p1ppn1p1/2b1pp2/4P3/1P2NQ1N/PBPP1PPP/4RRK1 w - f6',He is planning an attack on my Ne3 which I stop by exchanging for a second time.
1300,38,27,1Nd1,b'r2q1rk1/1p4np/p1ppn3/2b1pp2/8/1P3Q1N/PBPP1PPP/3NRRK1 b - -',Preventing 18...f4.
1301,38,28,1Qf6,b'r4rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/2b1pp2/8/1P3Q1N/PBPP1PPP/3NRRK1 w - -',Bringing in an attacker with his Queen.
1302,38,29,1Nc3,b'r4rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/2b1pp2/8/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Unlike before I'm willing to risk that pin because of what I believe is developing before me.  He takes advantage with that half pin.  This time I was concerned about 19...e4  After which he might try and formulate a calculation for pinning the Queen.  This wouldn't happen soon but I'm thinking in terms of a very long term variation since it's about thinking about thinking and planning ahead.  So as far as I'm concerned I am just stopping a problem before it starts.  Another way of saying this is preventing a problem.
1303,38,30,1Bd4,b'r4rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/4pp2/3b4/1PN2Q1N/PBPP1PPP/4RRK1 w - -',But on the second thought this isn't a pin.  My thinking is that he wanted to apply pressure on me.  My attitude is that it if this is what he was thinking pointless since I don't feel any pressure.  However it's not pressure that he wanted.  Therefore it has to be something that I'm missing.
1304,38,31,2Ba3,b'r4rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/4pp2/3b4/BPN2Q1N/P1PP1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Figuring that his plan didn't work I decide to attack his d6.  Calculating his next move and I formulate my plan for afterward.
1305,38,32,2Ne2,b'3r1rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/4pp2/3b4/BP3Q1N/P1PPNPPP/4RRK1 b - -',?? Which is this move.  But it's the decisive blunder which I overlook.  I felt that this was the only mistake in the whole game but against an opponent especially a runner one mistake is all that it takes.  As now he is going to get my Queen one way or another without compensation.  Just about anything was better then this as the N prevented his next move from coming.
1306,38,33,2Qg3,b'3r1rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/5p2/3bp3/BP4QN/P1PPNPPP/4RRK1 b - -',Attempting to protect my Queen.
1307,38,34,2Qg4,b'3r1rk1/1p4np/p1ppnq2/8/3bppQ1/BP5N/P1PPNPPP/4RRK1 b - -',And that attempt is still continuing.
1308,38,35,2h5,b'3r1rk1/1p4n1/p1ppnq2/7p/3bppQ1/BP5N/P1PPNPPP/4RRK1 w - h6',This is where I realized that the Queen is a goner.  But my attitude is that if he wins my Queen I'll get something for it.  The only thing is that it's not enough compensation.  So I'd normally resign but since it's a WTW game due to their rules resignation is not an option until mate is forced.  So then the idea becomes lasting as long as possible.  At first I thought that I might tie or break that 36 move which isn't going to happen here.  BTW move length although Ken has a good point on that is something that easy19 emphasizes (and it's one reason that the WTW club has a rule about resignation.)  However my thought process was also wrong because I don't get any compensation.  Through a bunch of exchanges he also gets my N after I take his.
1309,38,36,2g3,b'3r1rk1/1p6/p1ppnq2/8/4Rp2/BP4Pp/P1PP1P1P/5RK1 b - -',Without a good move left I play this.  I also considered 27.gxh3 but it would be mate shortly after 27...Rg7+
1310,38,37,2fxg3,b'3r1rk1/1p6/p1ppnq2/8/4R3/BP4Pp/P1PP3P/5RK1 b - -',?? So I took back figuring that I got a pawn back with the discovered attack on his Queen.  But it's mate.  The only thing that would've worked was letting his pawn remain where it was and allowing ...g2.  Now the Rook moves back but I'm pretty sure that it's still with ...Qf2+ with Kh1 (forced) and then ...Qg2#  So I wouldn't have lasted 36 moves but would become close to that.  I also like with itchnyscratchy didn't think the next move was mate.  Except that I overlooked his Rook behind Queen.
1311,38,38,2Qxf1#,b'3r1rk1/1p6/p1ppn3/8/4R3/BP4Pp/P1PP3P/5qK1 w - -',What this game shows is to judge carefully because it only takes one mistake to lose the game which I think is what happened here.
1312,39,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',It's a 1.e4 e5 opening as the agreement is.  I decided to defend with 2...Nc6 as I'm prepared for things like the Ruy Lopez.  Plus after 1...e5 he could also answer with this move but earlier so 2.Bc4.  Forgot what that was called but reversion played that against me in our second game against each but the first one in this tourney.  It's interesting though.  However I was also prepared for the Guaco Piano which this has become.
1313,39,1,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?! In which case I try something different and play this.  However I forgot that this is an inaccuracy as it blocks the center pawn.  In fact I remember telling reachforgoals one time that it's not good for that reason.  I on the other hand forgot that since I don't know the main continuation after the Guaco Piano.  I think that best however was 3...Bc5.
1314,39,2,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',He starts taking advantage by castling.
1315,39,3,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',However I'm preparing and planning to do the same thing.
1316,39,4,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',Which he stops with this move for if I castle he doesn't just get a pawn.  But taking would also cost me a piece due to the fork on my Nf6 and Bd6 combined with his Nf3.
1317,39,5,exd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I take first.
1318,39,6,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Instead of taking back right away he centralizes his Rook.  But I know why as it's more then just centralization.  In other words there's a bigger component to this.  If he forks that R just adds pressure to the center as well which is also one of the main points to centralizing the Rook.
1319,39,7,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',So I prevent him from winning a piece.
1320,39,8,e5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4P3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',With that being said I'm no longer bothered by this move as I had anticipated this anyhow.
1321,39,9,Ng8,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4P3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Although I don't enjoy undeveloping anything it's the only way to protect my piece.  But I will try to find a way to redevelop.  So I do not feel pressure.  That's because I feel that I know what to do and pressure is about not knowing what to do which isn't happening here.
1322,39,10,Bf4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4P3/2Bp1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',Presumably he wants down the f4-c7 diagonal.
1323,39,11,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2Bp1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',As noted earlier however I know what to do and thus don't feel pressure.  I'm putting pressure on his f2 pawn.  And my plan is to somehow if can safely be done eliminate the c pawn.  Once again my main interest is pinning the f2 pawn since it worked the first time that I did this combined with a different time.  First however it won't be safe here.  I guess this is where I finally realize that you do afterall have to base it on the position.  The problem is that I'm only thinking of one as opposed to multiple variations which is what's going to cost me the game here.  I remember what Kenneth_fire told me on studying many variations but ignored it here.  I figured out that this is also what it takes to figure out the story that the board is revealing.
1324,39,12,Ng5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P1N1/2Bp1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',As now he has pressure on my f7 instead.
1325,39,13,Nh6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/2b1P1N1/2Bp1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',Although I don't enjoy placing my N on the rim it's the only defense.  Anything else and he is going to win my Rh8 which I cannot allow.
1326,39,14,1Ne4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/2b1P3/2BpNB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',This is where I'm just beginning to feel pressure as I didn't know what to do here.
1327,39,15,1d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np3n/2b1P3/2BpNB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',?? But that quickly gets eliminated here since my idea of a good time is exchanging.  However I as you might have guess also only consider one variation and it's not his next move either.  The line I was thinking along was 11.exd6 with the idea of 11...cxd6.  I also overlooked that he wins a pawn.  However I consider this a serious blunder as now my King is badly exposed.  And as you might guess he will have a lot of attacking forces against it.  Needless to say that I wind up in a lot of trouble and can no longer castle.  So best was 11.Nf5 as not only is my N better placed but my monarch would not have winded opened up like this.
1328,39,16,1Qh5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np3p/2b1P2Q/2BpN3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',This is where he starts swarming.  In fact it's actually similar to when bhidragon played Qh6.  The difference is that his Queen didn't move until now.  The result however is the same as he building up his army against my monarch which like that game I'm going to miss and will pay.
1329,39,17,1Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1qp1p/2np3p/2b1P2Q/2BpN3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w kq -',I thought that this was the only way to save the position for now because unlike that game I'm trying to use my Queen to protect my monarch.  In other words it's not out of play.  But I'll need a lot more.
1330,39,18,1exd6,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1qp1p/2nP3p/2b4Q/2BpN3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',However it's much worse then that.  Were it safe I'd take back with my c pawn.  The problem is though that it would leave my Queen pinned which forces my next move and thus still leaves my monarch weakened.  And when this happens I'm going to lose a piece without compensation.  Plus the move that follows will be forced since I'll be in check.
1331,39,19,1d7,b'r1bk1q1r/pppP1p1p/2n4p/2N4Q/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',As now he's threatening to win my B.
1332,39,20,1Bxd7,b'r2k1q1r/pppb1p1p/2n4p/2N4Q/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',Figuring that not only have I protected a piece but gotten a pawn back I took.  And yes I didn't even attempt to consider multiple variations.  The line that I was thinking along was an exchange with 16.Nxd7 Kxd7.  After which it'd appeared that I'd be safe the problems would be close to eliminated.  In the process however this is only the beginning as I missed there is like that other game much more to the story then meets the eye.
1333,39,21,1Qd5,b'r2k1q1r/pppb1p1p/2n4p/2NQ4/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',As he is going to win a piece.
1334,39,22,1b6,b'r2k1q1r/p1pb1p1p/1pn4p/2NQ4/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',?? And this is the main area where I really overlooked the overall picture and told reachforgoals not to do in two of our training games.  The difference is that I wasn't hyperfocused on tempo gain.  If that were so this move wouldn't have come into consideration.  But it is however not thinking about the overall picture is what did me in here.  Ok I was thinking about his next move but after which and getting out of check my idea was ...bxc5 preventing the loss of a piece.  What I didn't consider however is that his next move is mate since my monarch cannot get out.  With that being said I had to give up my Queen with 16...Qd6 to save the game.  16...Kc8 doesn't work.  if 17.Qd7+ Kb8  18.Na6+ Kb7 19.Qc7# is still mate.    
1335,39,23,1Qxd7#,b'r2k1q1r/p1pQ1p1p/1pn4p/2N5/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',The moral of this story is to see the overall picture by trying to figuring what the board is revealing as opposed to thinking about one or two details.  The way to do this is by attempting to calculate multiple as opposed to only one variation.  That's because I once again got fixated on one or two things as opposed to how the games developing by only calculating one possibility and not even trying to consider other variations.
