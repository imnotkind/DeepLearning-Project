2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',more center control

17,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Somebody made a theorical mistake in the opening since the game soon desappears from the database. Anyway a tactically interesting opening.

Not to take the pawn will be as weakening the black diagonal well covered by his bishop so... "
22,1,5,cxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPBP1/5N1P/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R b KQ -',"At this point the only play I analyzed was the apparently good 9. ... Qb6 with a threat and a half over my pawns. I have many possible responses here. 

10. Qb3 fails to QxQ. 
10. Qc2 seems normal ok. 

Then the nice ones: 
10. d5.
10. e5. 
10. Nc4. 

Now this is what I like from chess: in 2 moves we have transformed an apparently normal opening in a highly tactical game. 
I have to consider all possible move from black including knight f6's sacrifice in order to be sure. 

10. d5 apparently opens the way to the bishop. But if the bishop takes b2 Rb1 is strong and if 10. ... Qxb2 11. Nc4 puts the black queen in troubles that white can take advantage of with more developement (and to counterarrest the threat on the black diagonal). The queen's check Qb4 is good for me since Bd2 closes the net and if Qb5 Nxd6 must be considered... all very long variants. And beside I have to think about Nxd6!? but I have to bet I'll never would have to take the bishop of course (not to let his rooks to come into the game). I found it good in all variants but still it is very dangerous. 

10. e5. The best response for black is Nd5. I analyzed dxe dxe and it doesn't seem to make a great difference. Not sure. Ok let's say Nd5.
11. Nc4 and the black queen must retire. The lines from Qb4+ or Qb5 are very similar to the ones seen before but again they are a lot of variant and I cannot be sure all my analysis is correct. 
Then the other possible moves are Qc7 (I would have played Rc1 inmediately) or Qd8. And this cannot be good for black. I analyzed so many variants here... but it's ok for me. 

Ok but since Nc4 is played in both variants why not to play it right now?
10. Nc4.
Now themes are similar to the previous but I don't have to cope with Nd5 with a bothering threat over my bishop. So this is the move. 

But I can say it now not at the moment I made the play. All this was just a jungle in my mind... :-)

I've set a conditional move here and I don't remember by now which it is so I hope I have played the last one Nc4.

36,1,19,7Ra6,b'8/8/R4pK1/5P2/8/p7/kb6/8 b - -',SO it was a draw position. 
37,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My most common opening although I am venturing out into the Queens pawn and the English opening.

45,2,8,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I look to castle.
46,2,9,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',So does black.

48,2,11,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black defends b5 knowing I have 3 pieces ready to converge on it.

I had spotted a potential double attack on blacks bishop and knight if I first protected e4 then moved e5 next would attack both his bishop and knight. It would also leave his ab pawns open to attack from my queen if although decided to exchange bishops.
53,2,16,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1bppn2/8/P3PP2/2N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So black decides to protect his bishop and ready's his rook dow the open c file.

Maybe I should not have made the move but I got away with it. Play would have gone 15...Rb1. 16. Qxa6 Rxb2. 17. Would either be Qd3Qf2 or Rfc1 to protect my c pawn and still a pawn up. So would not have been too bad I think at the time that were my reason for going ahead with Qxb7.

59,2,22,Bb4,b'2rqnrk1/5ppp/Q3p3/3pP3/Pb3P2/2N1B3/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black starts a Queen side attack of his own so mine will have to wait. Threatening the knight with both Bishop and Rook. Black would be up a pawn if I turned a blind eye to this. If I move the knight I lose the pawn too with Rxc2 and a rook on the second row is not good.  So my knight needs some protection.
60,2,23,1Qd3,b'2rqnrk1/5ppp/4p3/3pP3/Pb3P2/2NQB3/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',"I did not like my Queen out there by her self So I thought bring her back to defend the knight and the c pawn freeing my knight to move away.
 My other concern was black moving d4 forking my bishop and knight so I nearly moved Bd4 to block the advance of the pawn but in reply black may have gone for a bishop exchange by moving Bc5."
61,2,24,1Rc4,b'3qnrk1/5ppp/4p3/3pP3/Pbr2P2/2NQB3/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black prepares to double his attack down the c file with this move by making room for his Queen to move to c8.  This move also gives a d4 advance extra support.

65,2,28,2Rf3,b'2q1nrk1/5p1p/4p1p1/3pP3/PbrB1P2/2NQ1R2/1PP3PP/R6K b - -',Ideally I would like to move b3 to attack his rook but to do that the b2 pawn will have to be replaced by somthing else to protect the knight. 
66,2,29,2Ng7,b'2q2rk1/5pnp/4p1p1/3pP3/PbrB1P2/2NQ1R2/1PP3PP/R6K w - -',Black looks to put his knight on f5 and attack my Bishop.
67,2,30,2b3,b'2q2rk1/5pnp/4p1p1/3pP3/PbrB1P2/1PNQ1R2/2P3PP/R6K b - -',My knight now has ample protection for the exchange to go in my favor (21...Bxc3. 22.Bxc3Rxc3.23. Qxc3 Qxc3.24. Rxc3...) Leaving me with 2 rooks and 2 passed pawns to blacks rook and knight.

I attack his bishop knowing black would have to exchange Queens to save the bishop. Maybe black could have moved Rb8 here? I still would have exchanged Queens.

125,4,6,1Be3,b'N3nb1r/1p1qkppp/2npb3/p3p3/4P3/1N2BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Now the knight can escape to b6. If black had earlier tried 12... Qc8 13. Nc7 and white can chose where to put his knight again. Black resigns here.

I have an old book by Leonard Barden called The Ruy Lopez Winning Chess with 1P-K4. It's one of only two opening books I own. It offers only a very brief analysis in passing but it says the Old Steinitz is passive and fallen into disfavor and ""it is most forcefully countered by white's maintaining the option of castling on either wing"" - well I already blew that didn't I? The book says 4. d4 and 5. Nc3 are called for. Of course much may have changed in 46 years since the GK DB seems to believe the move as played is a strong choice."

130,5,4,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1pp1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Until this loss of tempo that is. But 5. ... a6 changed everything in the center so it seems prudent to challenge that center. White ould love nothing more than to play dxe4 and isolate black's doubled pawns on the c-file though I'm sure black won't allow that. And the pawn on e4 is safe enough with no defenders.
131,5,5,Qxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1pp1n2/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',An active queen. I love that. Put her in the center and watch her work. It's nice when she's safe from attack too.
132,5,6,Qd3,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p2p1n2/2p5/4P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Ok now she's safe.

134,5,8,1exd6,b'r2q1rk1/2pnbppp/p2P4/2p5/6b1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Now white's rook seizes an open file without even moving. Lazy rook.
135,5,9,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/3nbppp/p2p4/2p5/5Bb1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',two-on-one attacking the pawn on d6.
136,5,10,1Ng5,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/2p3N1/5Bb1/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',This move makes many threats. The obvious checkmate on h7 though that is currently defended. The threat of 16. Ne4 putting three-on-two attacking d6. and it also allows for 16. Nd5 which forks black's knight and bishop. A triple threat.
137,5,11,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/2pN2Nb/5B2/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White decides to start with the fork. Of course black cannot capture 16. ... Nxd5??? because that knight is needed to defend h7. Black is actually in a world of hurt because of 15. ... Bh5?. His other bishop on e7 is attacked twice and needs a defender but if 16. ... Re8 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6 (or gxf6) 18. Qxh7+ Kf8 19. Qh8#. Better is 16. ... Bg3 threatening white's queen but 17. Nxe7+ wins a piece for white. However black postponed his games and took some vacation time leaving me in suspense for many days while he was gone.
138,5,12,1Qxh7#,b'r2q1rk1/4bppQ/p2p4/2pn2Nb/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',My guess is that black came back and had a whole long queue full of games awaiting his moves. This move 16. Nxd5??? sure looks like it was rushed. In any case it was the one move black couldn't make but he did. I'll blame his vacation for distracting him.
139,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I call this Swindle and Shiester because of what happens near the end.  He gets swindle of all his remaining pieces in an fairly nice array of combo's. I play white.

145,6,6,2Ne5,b'1n1r2k1/p1R2pp1/b5qp/1p1pN3/3Q4/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Now the fireworks begin with the N-e5 forcing blacks Queen to move.

147,6,8,2Nc4,b'1n3rk1/p4Rp1/b2q3p/1p1p4/2NQ4/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',This move exposes # on Qxg7 and if he takes RxR then I take his queen with N
148,6,9,2Qg6,b'1n3rk1/p4Rp1/b5qp/1p1p4/2NQ4/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Reasonable move

153,6,14,Kxf6,b'1Q6/p5p1/b4k1p/1p1p4/8/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 w - -',taking with King was not the correct response.
154,6,15,3Qxa6,b'8/p5p1/Q6p/1p1p2k1/8/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Swindled.  Black resigns.
155,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A Mini-tournament game I'm playing white and you guessed it I start with the Open Game.
156,7,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My opponent however didn't want too much openness evidently since he chose the French Defense.
157,7,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',My favorite French trick though I never get to pull it off is to follow 4. Bg5 with 5. e5 and win a knight. Black never seems to let me do it though. I blame the GK DB... Nevertheless it's a good way to develop a piece with a threat and it nearly forces black's reply.
158,7,3,f4,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq f3',And now black is getting in his own way with his knight on d7 blocking his LSB. But of course anyone playing the French very often knows to expect a little cramping.
159,7,4,1O-O-O,b'r1b1k2r/1p1nqppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',Developing moves by both sides.

161,7,6,1fxe6,b'r1b1k2r/1p2qppp/pnn1P3/3pP3/2pP4/2N2N2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',The e6 pawn is in my opinion the lynch pin of the French. So he dies though black can replace him quickly enough if he chooses.
162,7,7,1g3,b'r3k2r/1p2qppp/pnn1b3/3pP3/2pP4/2N2NP1/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b kq -',The long diagonal looks good for white's LSB.
163,7,8,1h3,b'r3k2r/1p2qpp1/pnn1b2p/3pP3/2pP4/2N2NPP/PPPQ4/2KR1B1R b kq -',Preventing the pin by keeping the black bishop off of g4.
164,7,9,1Nh4,b'r3k2r/3nqpp1/p1n1b2p/1p1pP3/2pP3N/2N3PP/PPPQ2B1/2KR3R b kq -',Planning to go to f5 though white is about to get sidetracked and it will take 6 moves to get this knight to f5.
165,7,10,1Ne2,b'r3k2r/4qpp1/pnn1b2p/1p1pP3/2pP3N/6PP/PPPQN1B1/2KR3R b kq -',Sidetrack. This knight wants to whelm upon the black bishop on e6.
166,7,11,2Rhf1,b'2kr3r/5pp1/pnn1q2p/3pP3/1ppP3N/6PP/PPPQ2B1/2KR1R2 b - -',Cogitating and cogitating. How white dearly would love to get his LSB on the h3-c8 diagonal and skewer the black queen to her king but I could not find the way to force it to happen. Though if I had not played 16. Nh4 the way would be open for 20. H4 threatening 21. Bh3. Not that I think that would have worked and it's even less likely as a three-move combo. So instead white launches a mini-campaign against black's kingside pawns.
167,7,12,2Qf2,b'2kr3r/5pp1/p1n1q2p/3pP3/nppP3N/6PP/PPP2QB1/2KR1R2 b - -',This feels wrong or at least dangerous to hunt pawns on the kingside while black is forming a powerful queenside attack. White's king may find himself in jeopardy risking the loss of the game while black is risking only the loss of pawns - quite an imbalance of risks.
168,7,13,2Nf5,b'2kr1r2/5pp1/p1n1q2p/3pPN2/nppP4/6PP/PPP2QB1/2KR1R2 b - -',The immediate threat is to black's pawn on g7. But white is also threatening Nd6+ which puts three white pieces on the black pawn on f7.
169,7,14,2h4,b'2kr1r2/5pp1/p1n3qp/3pPN2/nppP3P/6P1/PPP2QB1/2KR1R2 b - -',White may be trying to do too much. This move threatens both h5 and Bh3 each of which creates problems for black. It might however have been simpler to just start with 23. Nd6+ offering to trade knight+pawn for rook else winning the f7 pawn outright.
170,7,15,2Qf4,b'1k1r1r2/5pp1/p1n3qp/3pPN2/nppP1Q1P/6P1/PPP3B1/2KR1R2 b - -',Black solved the threat of Nd6+ so white puts more pressure on black's king. Funny how a kingside pawn hunt turned into a harassment of black's king way over on the queenside.
171,7,16,2axb3,b'1k1r1r2/5pp1/p1n3qp/3pPN2/n1pP1Q1P/1P4P1/1PP3B1/2KR1R2 b - -',Black ignores the danger to his king or more accurately the danger to his other pieces that begins with a discovered check against his king and launches an attack of his own. White must deal with the advanced black pawns before continuing with his own attack.
172,7,17,2Rd3,b'1k1r1r2/5pp1/p1n3qp/3pPN2/n2P1Q1P/1p1R2P1/1PP3B1/2K2R2 b - -',26. Rd3 pretty much forces black's next move and 26. ... bxc2 effectively neutralizes black's advanced pawn until he can get more pieces into the attack. All of which gives white time to pounce.
173,7,18,2e6+,b'1k1r1r2/5pp1/p1n1P1qp/3p1N2/n2P1Q1P/3R2P1/1Pp3B1/2K2R2 b - -',Put an ! on this move. 27. e6+! took a long time for me to work out to figure out that all the angles were safe. With a combination of Qc7 and Rb3 white has several mating threats that black must carefully avoid. 27. ... Ka8 buys him the most time but then he immediately loses material with 28. e7. White's pawn forks the two rooks so 28. ... Nxe7 is forced after which white plays 29. Nxe7 winning black's knight and threatening the black queen. 29. ... Qb6 blunts white's mating attacks but creates new problems after white plays 30. b3 and the black knight has nowhere to run. But any other queen move leaves black dangerously vulnerable to white's mating threats. And white still holds Qe5 forking the d5 and g7 pawns to win another pawn. Faced with all the threats black chose to resign.
174,8,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A recently finished game in my mini-tournament which is set to automatically start each game with the Gruenfeld Defence. In this game I go into the endgame a pawn up and then a series of THREE TACTICS wins me a rook and the game.
175,8,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',This is the Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to create an imposing Classical pawn centre with 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 but can then put terrific pressure on it with ...Bg7 ...c5 and ...Nc6 - this is the very sharp Exchange Variation. If White can maintain his powerful pawn centre however he can expect to hold a positional advantage.
176,8,2,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White's other option is to bypass sharp lines with the slower 4.Nf3 the Three Knights Variation or with 4.Bf4. However I have great faith in my ability to hold onto an advantage in central space and as usual I play the Exchange Variation.

178,8,4,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',White has a powerful well-defended pawn centre and is ready to start cramping Black's position. The only problem is the backward and weak d4-pawn but the extra pawn is more than enough to conpensate.
179,8,5,Bc4,b'rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p3np1/3P4/2BPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',Not a particularly active post for my bishop but I wanted to make way for castling on the kingside - sharpening the game up with 0-0-0 would be foolhardy considering I am already up by a pawn and lots of space control.

An interesting move clearly aimed at fianchettoing the kingside bishop to prevent it from being blocked in by pawns on d6 and c5.

I can see its logic preventing Black from exchanging with ...Bg4. 5.h3 is the main line of the Czech Benoni; I hadn't thought to see it here. I suppose this is a good time on a different note to mention one of my main long-term errors in this game: my attitude to the position. I still saw it as a blocked and slow Benoni position: I had failed to change my style of play to correspond with the transposition into the much sharper King's Indian Defence.

Black's minor pieces are also far from the kingside's defence. However of course if Black mobilises his defensive pieces quickly he will stand a good change of weathering the onslaught.

Over the past few days I have been playing a game with a very strong near-Master called Lighttotheright (Ken).  He decided to kick off with e4 and play the Vienna Gambit.  I accepted it but was it the right thing to do?  The jury is out as the action unfolds."

This is not a good acceptance though because the knight on f6 can be driven back by the pawn thrust e5 as I found out to my chagrin on move 4.  Black therefore loses tempo grabbing the f pawn - not very good against a player 400 points north of my rating.  

Ken had this to say about that move:- Instead of 3. ... exf4 d5 was more appropriate. It is sharper but it tends to give White more problems. ***** This variation is somewhat more similar to the King's Gambit. I already much prefer White's position. But we are still well within established theory. You still have plenty of chances to defend adequately.My punishment however was not overly severe as you will find when you read on."

Qe2 - the Wicked Witch of the West comes to e2 - although she blocks in the white lsb she causes major problems in pinning my e pawn.  I look at the db options and I realise that if I choose Be6 which seems the best of the bunch I see a very nasty queen fork on b5 where the b7 pawn will fall leaving a gaping hole in my queenside pawns.  No thank you!  So I rack my brains and come up with c6 - another pawn move.  Now Ken picks off the gambited pawns.

525,24,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Fatcat linked to this game recently when commenting on another annotation so I decided (with his permission) to annotate this one for him. We begin with a Queen's Pawn opening.
526,24,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Vidmar's Opening a quieter choice than the Queen's Gambit (2. c4). It is usually chosen by players aiming for the Stonewall system (the system played in this game with the further moves Bd3 f4 and c3). White aims to set up a solid position from which to launch an attack without directly challenging Black in the centre early in the game.
527,24,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is a common way to defend against the Stonewall. Black limits the scope of the bishop on d3.
528,24,3,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq f3',With this move White is committed to the Stonewall formation. The hole on e4 is apparent but for now is covered by the bishop on d3. Still it is a long-term disadvantage and one reason why the Stonewall is seldom seen in master-level games.
529,24,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Both sides continue with normal developing moves.
530,24,5,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1n2np1/3p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',(!?) Black's idea is to counterattack on the queenside. The GK database recommends 7... Bg4 delaying the thematic Ne5 which is often the start of White's attack in the Stonewall.
531,24,6,Nbd2,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1n2np1/3p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',With this move White's development is essentially complete since the c1 bishop was never going anywhere anyway. Now the attack can start!
532,24,7,1fxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p1pP3/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This is the idea behind White's early f-pawn push. Black's knight is chased away making it easier to attack the kingside. Traditionally this is followed by a bishop sacrifice on h7 although in this game Black's fianchetto has made this impossible.
533,24,8,1Ng4,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p5p1/1p1pP3/3P2n1/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Certainly not 10... Nh5?? 11. g4 winning the knight. But it might have been better to retreat it to e8 where it helps defend the g7 bishop and keeps an eye on the f6 square. (Of course the knight also defends f6 from g4 but not securely since White can force it away with h3.)
534,24,9,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/2p1ppbp/p3b1p1/1p1pP3/3P2n1/2PBPN2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Another disadvantage of Ng4 is that Bg4 cannot be played. However Be6 is not as bad as it looks; perhaps Black anticipates White's coming e4 and the exchange on d5 increasing the bishop's scope.
535,24,10,c6,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/p1p1b1p1/1p1pP3/3PP1n1/2PB1N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',(?!) If Black has decided to recapture on d5 with the bishop this move seems purposeless. Better is 12... c5! and if White captures Black regains a pawn on e5 and White must then choose between two evils -- if he plays b4 c3 is vulnerable but if he does not c5 is hard to defend. Black's earlier moves to a6 and b5 left the c-pawn backward so it was inevitable that if Black's queenside counterattack was ever to come to anything this pawn would have to cross the c5 square undefended. Moving it to c6 first wastes a tempo.
536,24,11,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/p1p3p1/1p1bP3/3P2n1/2PB1N1P/PP4P1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White decides to force the knight back before continuing operations.
537,24,12,1Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/p1p3pn/1p1bP3/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',(?!) This looks like a developing move but in fact this bishop's job is entirely centred around the c1-h6 diagonal and it could have stayed on its home square. White should instead be pressing his attack by moving h4-h5. The move played does start to clear a line for the rook but it's not yet time for the artillery to move into position.
538,24,13,1f6,b'r2q1rk1/4p1bp/p1p2ppn/1p1bP3/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black starts to free up his position as well as giving the knight a route to better squares.
539,24,14,1exf6,b'r2q1rk1/4p1bp/p1p2Ppn/1p1b4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White must exchange. This could not really have been prevented by 15. Qe2 as then 15... f6 16. e6 Qc8 leaves the pawn difficult to defend.
540,24,15,1Qc1,b'r2q1rk1/6bp/p1p2ppn/1p1b4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP1B2P1/R1Q2RK1 b - -',Ah was this White's idea when he played Bd2? If so it works out very well for him but it should not have done. Simply 17... Nf7 and Black has two pieces covering the h6 square.
541,24,16,1g5,b'r2q1rk1/6bp/p1p2p1n/1p1b2p1/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP1B2P1/R1Q2RK1 w - -',This however is weak because the obvious move h4 puts Black under a lot of pressure.
542,24,17,1Rxf3,b'r2q1rk1/6bp/p1p2p1n/1p4p1/3P3P/2PB1R2/PP1B2P1/R1Q3K1 b - -',A pragmatic decision. 19. gxf3 would deny Black a tempo gain after 19... g4 and forces him to find 19... Nf7 or lose material. However if Black does find Nf7 then the pawn capture looks like a mistake exposing White's king and blocking the rook's file.
543,24,18,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/6bp/p1p2p1n/1p6/3P2pP/2PB1R2/PP1B2P1/R1Q3K1 w - -',(?) The gain of tempo gives Black another chance to play Nf7 after this move but then White will take the g4 pawn pin the g7 bishop and open a highway right into the heart of Black's position. Really 19... Nf7 was Black's last chance.
544,24,19,Qd7,b'r4rk1/3q2bp/p1p2p1n/1p6/3P2pP/2PB2R1/PP1B2P1/R1Q3K1 w - -',(?!) Either Black failed to notice that the knight was insufficiently defended or he decided that keeping the g-file closed was more important -- which would actually be an understandable reason for this move. Either way things look bleak for Black.
545,24,20,2Qf4,b'r4rk1/6qp/p1p5/1p3p2/3P1QpP/2PB2R1/PP4P1/R5K1 b - -',After going a piece up White correctly aims to place his pieces on the most active squares possible aiming to tie Black's pieces down to defensive roles and then overload them.
546,24,21,2Re3,b'r4rk1/8/p1p3q1/1p3p1p/3P1QpP/2PBR3/PP4P1/5RK1 b - -',White could have taken on f5 right away but this move is okay since Black cannot save the pawn.
547,24,22,2Bxf5,b'5rk1/r7/p1p3q1/1p3B1p/3P1QpP/2P1R3/PP4P1/5RK1 b - -',This is still fine. The mistake comes later.
548,24,23,2Be6,b'5rk1/5r2/p1p1B1q1/1p5p/3P1QpP/2P1R3/PP4P1/5RK1 b - -',(!) White has an easy win with 27. Bxg6 Rxf4 28. Rxf4 Rxf4 29. Bxh5 but this move could have led to something even better....
549,24,24,2Rxe6,b'5rk1/5r2/p1p1R3/1p5p/3P1QpP/2P5/PP4P1/5RK1 b - -',(??) 28. Qg5+ wins on the spot. The possible lines are: (a) 28... Qg6 29. Qxg6+ with mate in four; (b) 28... Kh7 (or Kh8) 29. Rxe6 Rxf1+ 30. Kh2 and White is queen for rook up but the mating threat forces Black to give back the rook; (c) 28... Rg7 29. Rxf8+ Kxf8 30. Qxg7+ Kxg7 31. Rxe6 and White is only a rook up but can take on c6 and create a passed pawn next move. I give this two question marks by the way because as well as missing an easy win it gives up White's extra piece.
550,24,25,3Rxc6,b'6k1/8/p1R5/1p5p/3P1rpP/2P5/PP4P1/6K1 b - -',White does at least come out two pawns up usually a winning advantage in an endgame.
551,24,26,3g3,b'6k1/8/p1R5/1p5p/3P1r1P/2P3p1/PP4P1/6K1 w - -',To pick off the h4 pawn which cannot be defended. Black probably saw that he loses the g-pawn in return but exchanging kingside pawns is to Black's advantage since if both pairs go his king can take up a defensive post on the queenside.
552,24,27,3Rg6+,b'6k1/8/p5R1/1p5p/3P1r1P/2P3p1/PP4P1/6K1 b - -',Why not 31. Rxa6 to finish three pawns up instead of two after 31... Rxh4 32. Rg6+ and 33. Rxg3? Firstly because Black could prevent that with 31... Kf7 when play might continue 32. Rb6 Rf5 (Rxh4 33. Rxb5 is easily winning) and White still needs to find a way to develop his king. More importantly 31. Rg6+ should be an easier win because of 33. Rh3! See next note.
553,24,28,3Rf3+,b'8/5k2/p7/1p5p/3P3r/2P2R2/PP4P1/6K1 b - -',(?!) Pushing Black's king where it wants to go. Better is 33. Kf2 activating the king but better still is 33. Rh3! Re4 (forced; exchanging rooks would be suicide) 34. Rxh5 Re2 35. Rf5+ and 36. Rf2 defends White's three-pawn advantage and Black can resign.
554,24,29,3Ra8,b'R7/8/p7/1p1k3p/3P3r/2P5/PP4P1/6K1 b - -',Instead White attacks the pawns from behind: a good plan since Black will have difficulty keeping everything defended.
555,24,30,3Re4,b'R7/8/p7/1p1k3p/3Pr3/2P5/PP4P1/6K1 w - -',This zwischenzug does however make ...Re6 defending a6 a possibility. If White takes on a6 immediately Black will be able to play the counterattacking move Re2.
556,24,31,3Kf2,b'R7/8/p7/1p1k3p/3Pr3/2P5/PP3KP1/8 b - -',White pragmatically chooses to prevent Re2 so as to keep his connected pawns. However 36. Rxa6 Re2 37. b3 Rc2 38. Rh6 Rxc3 (Rxa2 39. Rxh5+ Kc6 40. Rc5+ is even worse) 39. Rxh5+ leaves White with a three-pawn lead and the win should be straightforward. For instance 39... Kc6 40. g4 Rc2 41. a4 b4 42. Rh3 followed by 43. Rg3 and Black is without hope.
557,24,32,3Kc4,b'R7/8/p7/1p5p/2kPr3/2P5/PP3KP1/8 w - -',And Black chooses not to defend the a-pawn going into a temporary three-pawn deficit. Passive defence would lose quickly: 36... Re6 37. Rh8 Rf6+ 38. Ke3 Rf5 39. Rh6 a5 40. Ra6 a4 41. Rb6 Kc4 42. Ke4 and Black must either surrender the rook or allow 43. Rc6 mate!
558,24,33,3Ra5,b'8/8/8/Rp5p/3Pr3/2Pk4/PP3KP1/8 b - -',(?) Black is about to capture on b2 so b5 will be defended anyway. Instead 38. Rh6 Re2+ 39. Kf1 (not g3) Rxb2 40. Rxh5 Rxa2 41. Rh3+ leaves White two pawns up and with his rook in an active position. Even better the g-pawn can be advanced thanks to its double move without interfering with the rook's defence of c3! The game might continue 41... Kc2 42. g4 Ra3 43. g5 and now after Rxc3 White exchanges rooks and wins the pawn race. It's even possible that 38. Ra5 turns a winning position into a draw in which case it deserves two question marks but the ensuing endgame is too complicated for me to be certain about whether or not this is the case.
559,24,34,4Ra3,b'8/8/8/1p5p/3P4/R1Pk2K1/Pr4P1/8 b - -',The sad consequence of 38. Ra5: the only way to save the c-pawn is to condemn the rook to passivity. However Black cannot take c3 even if he attacks it with rook and king since White has ensured the a-pawn remains on the board and the d-pawn would promote long before Black could do anything with his b-pawn. So the queenside will remain in an impasse while White tries to round up Black's h-pawn.
560,24,35,Rd2,b'8/8/8/1p5p/2kP4/R1P4K/P2r2P1/8 w - -',Aiming for d3 to limit the movement of White's king. A very interesting alternative Black could have tried was 41... b4. After 42. cxb4 Rxb4 Black wins the d-pawn leaving him only one pawn down with White's extra pawn on a rook's file which should be drawn. If 42. Rb3 Rxb3?? loses (43. axb3 bxc3 would be nice for Black but is illegal because of the check) but 42... Rxa2 43. Rxb4+ Kxc3 wins all White's queenside pawns with a draw. However it seems White does have a winning continuation: 42. Ra4 when 42... Kxc3 43. d5 b3 44. axb3 Rxb3 45. d5 Rb6 46. Kh4 Rd6 47. Kxh5 is a theoretical win for White and 43... Rd2 44. Ra5 Kc4 45. g3 Rd3 (Rxd5 loses) 46. Kh4 also seems to win.
561,24,36,4Rb3,b'8/8/8/1p5p/2kP4/1RPr2PK/P7/8 b - -',White realises he cannot win the h-pawn with his king alone without losing the g-pawn. However mobilising the rook will lose the a- and c-pawns a sad effect of the rook's passive placement. It's not clear at all how White can win from this position or even whether he can win. If he does exchange the kingside pawns Black's rook will be on the g-file cutting White's king off from the action and again if White tries to mobilise his rook to free his king he will lose at least the c-pawn immediately. But if White does not exchange his king and rook are both tied down to defence and the only mobile pawn d4 cannot advance without being taken.
562,24,37,4Rd2,b'8/8/8/1p5p/2kP4/1RP3PK/P2r4/8 w - -',A change of plan: Black abandons the pin to go after the a-pawn. This works because after 44. Kh4 Rxa2 the rook is unprotected so White must play 45. Rb1 allowing 45... Kxc3 46. Rxb5 Rh2+ 47. Kg5 Kxd4 with a draw. So White is forced to repeat the position with 44. Ra3 Rd3 and if White can find nothing better than Rb3 then the game will end in a draw by repetition.
563,24,38,4Rxb5,b'8/8/8/1R5p/2kP4/2P3PK/P2r4/8 b - -',(??) Instead of a dull draw by repetition we have a dull blunder leading to a quick loss. The interest in this endgame is in the analysis :)
564,24,39,Rxg3,b'8/8/8/1k5K/3P4/2P3r1/P7/8 w - -',"White resigns quite correctly since the pawns cannot create a meaningful threat and Black will soon round them up. With best play Black mates no later than move 64. The only question is whether the position before White's last blunder really was ""easily winning"" as fatcat2 originally claimed."
565,25,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I apologize to my opponent. On 1/17/09 when this game began my rating was 1274 and our ratings were only 50-60 points apart which didn't seem too significant. But now our ratings are nearly 700 points apart which is quite significant indeed. It led to a bit of a one-sided match. We played this open challenge game for nearly three months averaging about 10 moves per month. In the future I plan to avoid games with time limits of 14-days. I'm playing black and my opponent starts with the Open game so I respond with the Sicilian.

Nh5 which would force black's queen to h2 a very undignified square for a mighty queen (12. Qh4 loses to 12. ... Bf3). Then I decided against it in favor of attacking the center. Besides playing the knight to attack the white queen would be much juicier if that pawn way up there at b2 were undefended.

Just finished this little unrated game against my Expert buddy Dave.  I first got to play Dave in IM Beafyness's mini-tournament.  I got canned by him as black but managed to make a battle of it in ""A Mating Attack Gone Wrong"" as white.  Well things went quite a bit wrong here.  In trying to undouble my pawns I overlooked a rook fork and lost a pawn.  In order to avoid further damage I had to exchange down to a K & P ending which I have stressed over and over again is SCUICIDE!  However in this case I decided to play on because I had a queenside pawn majority.  My plan nearly worked but guess what I blundered again and got taught yet another lesson anyhow back to the beginning - Dave decides to give me the Caro-Kann Defense after I kicked off with 1. e4.

This is another game in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament group.  Just imagine you are a pawn up you are in a 2 piece ending surely the game is in the bag.  But not always sometimes the pawn structures can be as such that a gridlock ensues.  It did in this game.  I had the pawn plus but could not seem to be able to do anything with it so I held out the olive branch and my opponent accepted it.

732,33,22,4bxa5,b'8/8/3k3p/P1p3p1/4P1P1/2P1KP2/7P/8 b - -',The a- and e-pawns are far enough apart that black's king cannot stop both of them. White won't even have to move his king to defend the promoting pawn: 44. ... Kc6 45. a6 Kb6 46. e5 Kxa6 47. e6 Kb6 48. e7 Kc6 49. e8=Q+. Seeing this black resigned. Rafabio and I split our two matches four games 3-1 yet he won more rating points for his one victory than I won for my three. Well played by my opponent.

So many times have my Expert and Master buddies have said how patient they have been when they have been trying to press home advantages or even deal with slight disadvantages when playing me.  Well this time it is my turn to be the higher rated opponent here.  I end up playing against the Sicilian Dragon.  I try to break through but meet stubborn resistance and at one stage my opponent (whose optimum rating was 1562) had very much the better of it.  He slipped up very late on in the game and allowed me to win 2 pawns.  I sacrificed those two pawns to exchange into a K & P ending.  Henry had the final say and I got my first rated win in about 3 weeks."

Look at all those prawns!  Henry is licking his lips.  All three ebony pawns will duly drop off and it will be a toss up between one of my three ivory pawns as to which one gets to Glendadom.

It looks like 8. e4 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 Nxe4 10. Bxe5 is strong for white isolating black's d-pawn and gaining the lead in controlling the center. Since white didn't do it black adds some defense to the e5 pawn to prevent it in the future.

With the advanced center pawn and a much stronger center and a castled king and 4 pieces developed to white's two (it seems unfair to call the knight on h2 developed) black is ready to exploit white's passive moves. Unfortunately for black white's passive moves have left him fairly well defended with little for black to exploit.

The white queen doesn't have very many safe moves and all of them lose material for white. For example if 19. Qh5 then 19. ... Nd3+ 20. Kd1 Nxf2+ and white loses the exchange and if 20. Kf1 or 20. Ke2 then 20. ... Nf4+ and white loses his queen. Alternatively 19. Qd1 Nd3+ 20. K-any Nb2+ and white loses his queen. 19. Qf4?? and 19. Qe4?? both lose the queen immediately to Nd6+. e2 f3 h4 g5 g6 e6 d7 and c8 are all instant death. I think 19. Qf5 is white's only safe move.

After I played this move I worked out the next few moves and realized that black can win much more than a bishop. At this time I announced mate in 5 beginning with the move just played 21. ... Bb3+. I just created a puzzle out of this position and in doing so I discovered something that should have been obvious. White can block with his bishop a futile move that does nothing but stall but it turns this into a mate in 6 instead of 5.

The natural choice to activate the inactive rook and keep the strong rook on the open file. But last move I found the mate in 5 and it requires my rook on a8 to stay home.
811,36,17,Rc2+,b'r5k1/pp3ppp/1n6/8/3P4/Pb3nNP/1KrB1PPN/R6R w - -',This is the point that white realized his goose was cooked and resigned. Maybe black's having announced mate in 5 three moves ago added to the realization. The continuation is 24. Kb1 Nxd2# or 24. Kxb3 Nxd4+ 25. Kb4 (forced) a5#. Checkmate with a pawn made possible by the rook who stayed home on a8. I really love the way the four black pieces are all working in harmony each one shutting off one or two escape squares for the king (with a little help from white's pawn who adds the finishing touch by keeping the king from fleeing to a3.

Nc3 we reach the Owen's Defense (more common from a side line of the French Defense with 1. e4 e6 2. d4 b6 3 Nc3). Owen's Defense is considered by most to be fairly inferior allowing white to establish and hold a superior center while black falls behind in development. According to Wiki it's greatest use is surprising opponents who aren't prepared for it which may be great in a tournament hall but not so great in online or correspondence chess where books and other references are allowed. However white deviates with a different line preparing to castle kingside earlier than would be possible after 3. Nc3.

I'm juggling 25 games or so I've never seen this opening and I'm relying on the GK DB to guide me through the first moves so I don't screw them up while I spend much more time on a dozen other games that are all demanding moves. The DB said 4. Bd3. I looked in the DB came back to the game and played 4. Be3?. I don't know why. I guess too much hurry and not enough attention and zero analysis of what the move actually looked like. So yeah white loses a pawn here for nothing. Because I'm an idiot.
