47,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Rublevsky is a very powerful GM but he has a very narrow (but well analyzed) opening repertiore.  I've heard claims that this has stopped him from passing the 2700 mark but I can't really say.
48,1,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The french defense a favorite of Volkov.
49,1,2,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Rublevsky always chooses the tarrasch against the french.  The most natural move is 3.Nc3 this move also develops the knight without blocking the c pawn.  This also avoids the winawer (3.Nc3 Bb4) as 3... Bb4? is easily parried by the strong 4.c3.
50,1,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The knight comes forward with pressure.
51,1,4,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',And white pushes the knight away with tempo.  The pawn on e5 guarantees a nice spacial advantage.
52,1,5,Nfd7,b'rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',However black's knight can become active on d7 it controls c5 (which is black's standard pawn break) and pressures e5.  As happens later in this game it also can return to f6.
53,1,6,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',A good square for the bishop the d2 knight will eventually have to move (to let the c1 bishop into the game) and f3 seems the ideal square thus a plan needs to be found for the g1 knight.  It's best square (besides f3) is e2 so the bishop should develop first instead of being blocked in.
54,1,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq c6',Black's standard pawn break.
55,1,8,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',And white defends making a pawn chain that gives great space on the kingside.
56,1,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black continues to develop while pressuring d4.
57,1,10,Ne2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White follows his chosen scheme of development while defending d4.
58,1,11,f6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n2pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black chooses to underming white's center he hopes to leave white with an isolated queen's pawn and white is forced to oblige due to the pressure on e5.
59,1,12,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Both sides have gotten well into development and both seem reasonably placed.  White's weakness on d4 is offset by black's backwards pawn on e6.  White's a little more aimed at the kingside and black has an awful bishop on c8.  I think white has a definite advantage here but black is perfectly playable.  White should try to gain control of the dark squares (as black has huge holes there).
60,1,13,1Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P1B2/3B1N2/PP2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White's dark squared domination plan begins with exchanging off black's 'good' bishop.
61,1,14,Ne4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/3p4/3PnN2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This move comes with a discovered attack on the f4 knight it also places black's knight on a momentarily active square however it's not well supported and it won't stay there long.
62,1,15,1Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/3p3N/3Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White's knight looks very threatening on the kingside but it's also on the edge and it isn't immediately threatening so I think black should ignore it instead of the following move.
63,1,16,1g6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp5p/2n1p1p1/3p3N/3Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',All but one of black's pawns are on light squares making dark squared penetration from white very dangerous.
64,1,17,1hxg3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp5p/2n1p1p1/3p4/3P4/3B1NP1/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And black has lost his powerful outpost.  White has the far better bishop the space advantage has stayed and there are potential dark squared problems for black.
65,1,18,Bd7,b'r4rk1/pp1b3p/1qn1p1p1/3p4/Q2P4/3B1NP1/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',? This is a definite inaccuracy but it's subtle.  However it's not because he should grab on b2 after 17... Qxb2 white can play 18.Bb5 (there may be better but this is VERY strong) this combines threats of Bxc6 winning back the pawn with an excellent position and the even more powerful Rab1 where after ...Qc3 the move Rfc1 wins at least a piece.  The reason this move (17... Bd7) is bad is because of which pieces are important black's got a bad bishop and his knight is clearly black's strongest piece.  On the other hand while white's got a great bishop it's his knight that can access the holes like e5 and g5 in black's position.
66,1,19,1Bb5,b'r4rk1/pp1b3p/1qn1p1p1/1B1p4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',!! A great positional move designed to gain an advantageous knight vs. bishop position.  Later Volkov played 17... a6! in order to stop this move though I still have a definite preference for white- all of black's pawns are on light squares.  This means if white's queen can find a good square for dark square control black'll be filled with weaknesses.
67,1,20,1Rac1,b'2r2rk1/pp1b3p/1qn1p1p1/1B1p4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 b - -',Both sides bring rooks the ever important c file.
68,1,21,1a6,b'2r2rk1/1p1b3p/pqn1p1p1/1B1p4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 w - -',And black's pawns are now ALL on light squares.
69,1,22,2Qa3,b'2r2rk1/1p5p/pqb1p1p1/3p4/3P4/Q4NP1/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 b - -',! As I've pointed out the important squares for white to attack are the dark squares with this move white gets good control of the third rank and threatens infiltration to e7.
70,1,23,2Bb5,b'2r2rk1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/1b1p4/3P4/Q4NP1/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 w - -',Black tries to get his bishop into the game.
71,1,24,Rxc1,b'5rk1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/1b1p4/3P4/Q4NP1/PP3PP1/2r1R1K1 w - -',Black has an interesting plan.  It doesn't actually work but he tries to either trade his bishop for the knight or at least win one of the two weak pawns (b2 and d4).  This move wins a tempo and draws the rook away from the e file where it attacks the backward e6 pawn and covers the e2 square where black wants to put his bishop.
72,1,25,Be2,b'5rk1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/3p4/3P4/Q4NP1/PP2bPP1/2R3K1 w - -',How does white defend the pawn without allowing his strong knight to be traded off?  He utilizes his advantages the weak black e pawn and the pressure on dark squares.
73,1,26,2Ng5,b'5rk1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/3p2N1/3P4/Q5P1/PP2bPP1/2R3K1 b - -',! The knight pops into and aggresive (dark) square hits e6 and indirectly defends the d pawn due to the pretty tactic 24... Qxd4 25.Qxf8 ! Kxf8 26.Nxe6  forking and queen and winning a rook overall.  Also the infiltration of Qe7 is looking VERY strong.
74,1,27,2Re8,b'4r1k1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/3p2N1/3P4/Q5P1/PP2bPP1/2R3K1 w - -',Black defends e6 and covers the e7 square.
75,1,28,2Qe3,b'4r1k1/1p5p/pq2p1p1/3p2N1/3P4/4Q1P1/PP2bPP1/2R3K1 b - -',Another strong move it attack e2 piles on the e6 square and prepares the following combination.  Where's the bishop going to go?
76,1,29,2Qxb2,b'4r1k1/1p5p/p3p1p1/3p2N1/3P4/4Q1P1/Pq2bPP1/2R3K1 w - -',Instead of retreating the bishop black grabs a pawn so what does white have in compensation?  Black is STILL filled with holes he has three pieces that easily enter the attack to black's one on defense how does he utilize this...
77,1,30,2Rc8,b'2R1r1k1/1p5p/p3p1p1/3p2N1/3P4/4Q1P1/Pq2bPP1/6K1 b - -',White's going to win e6 and the black is going to be ripped apart.  Until now white has had a solid advantage and he's played for solid positional game now it culminates in a powerful attack.
78,1,31,2Qe7+,b'2r5/1p2Q1kp/p5p1/3p2N1/3P4/6P1/Pq2bPP1/6K1 b - -',Until now it looked like white was going to regain material but this move starts an attack that leads to mate 8 moves later it's amazing what GMs can see!  Note that this check is on a dark square the dark weakness is still very important to this attack and white utilizes the h4-d8 diagonal.
79,1,32,Kh6,b'2r5/1p2Q2p/p5pk/3p2N1/3P4/6P1/Pq2bPP1/6K1 w - -',This kind of repetition is common in GM play it tests the waters to see if somone'll screw up (29... Kh5? 30.Qg5#) and gains a little time.  Now white plays the right move.
80,1,33,3Ne6,b'2r5/1p2Q2p/p3N1pk/3p4/3P4/6P1/Pq2bPP1/6K1 b - -',! It's very difficult to spot this type of move when you sacrifice a rook it's very risky (and scary) to play moves that aren't checks this threatens mate on g5 and locks the black king on the edge.
81,1,34,3Qc1+,b'2r5/1p2Q2p/p3N1pk/3p4/3P4/6P1/P3bPP1/2q3K1 w - -',The check covers the g5 square with win of tempo.
82,1,35,Rc6,b'8/1p2Q2p/p1r1N1pk/3p4/3P4/6P1/P3bPPK/2q5 w - -',This is the one time when black gets time for a move in the defense so I'm tempted to think there must be better than this move but I see no defense to the following attack.  Black hopes to play ...Rxe6 ending the attack up a piece.
83,1,36,3Qg7+,b'8/1p4Qp/p1r1N1pk/3p4/3P4/6P1/P3bPPK/2q5 b - -',It's too bad that Qh4  is blocked by ...Bh5 and Qg5  is covered by the black queen.  However with this move the black king is driven farther into the open.
84,1,37,3f4,b'8/1p4Qp/p1r1N1p1/3p3k/3P1P2/6P1/P3b1PK/2q5 b - f3',! Another excellent quiet move in the attack!  This locks out the queen's defense of h6 and white now threatens to take on h7 without black being able to block here's a sample line: 34... Rxe6 35.Qxh7  Kg4 36.Qh3#.
85,1,38,3h6,b'8/1p4Q1/p1r1N1pp/3p3k/3P1P2/6P1/P3b1PK/2q5 w - -',The only move to cover h6 but the dark squares (as always) prove a weakness for black.
86,1,39,3Qf6,b'8/1p6/p1r1NQpp/3p3k/3P1P2/6P1/P3b1PK/2q5 b - -',! A third quiet move that white had to see when he sacked the rook.  The threat of Qh4# is ALMOST unstoppable.
87,1,40,3Ng7+,b'8/1p4N1/p1r2Q1p/3p2pk/3P1P2/6P1/P3b1PK/2q5 b - -',And black resigns in view of 36... Kg4 37.Qf5#.  I think this was a wonderful attack white played excellent moves to cover the dark squares at the end but all along white was creating holes by move 19 black had all SIX pawns on light squares.  I think the bishop for knight exchange was the best move of the game it led to black's inability to defend dark squares and made black lose his one strong piece.  This was also a surprisingly powerful attack for so few pieces but black's holes made up for the lack of pieces.  I hope you enjoyed this game!  Please comment if you have any criticism idea or just want to say anything.

128,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I'm playing Thomas G a fellow Alabama Chess Federation reserve player.  He's a catastrophically underrated player both OTB and on gameknot and the most shining example of adult ADHD I've ever seen.  ...meaning he'd destroy me every game we play here if it weren't for the fact that I'm really just one in a simul of 10 or 20 he's playing with very little time per board.  Don't let the nearly 400 point rating difference fool you this guy is every bit my match.  Come to think of it I think he's up on me in casual blitz games something like 2 to 1 (IHOP Montgomery February 2007 -- I did *not* expect to get demolished like that Tom.)
129,3,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',BTW I've played e4 almost exclusively for 27 years now.  Suddenly I got the urge to play d4.  Also tried it OTB.  I did better than I thought.  But I'm not going to do any of the bicycle-with-training-wheels systems (colle torre)...  I'm going for... er.  Hell I don't even know what to call this.  Sigh.

Black has to be extremely careful but It's not a totally winning sac for white unless the second piece is accepted.  Ain't that a kick in the pants!

I was tempted to put this away for the night.  I know damn well there's a win in here but it isn't a direct sequence of forcing moves.  Then I remembered that if 21... gx Qxg6 I wasn't looking at a total forcing series of moves there either and I was just fine.

446,15,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I believe this is the most logical defense against e4 since White wants to create a strong centre with d4. My move and e5 both control d4 to stop the central expansion but c5 creates less weaknesses than e5.
447,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Playing Nf3 against Sicilian usually indicates White wants to open the position with d4. Although White doesn't have to play d4 so Nf3 doesn't really indicate a clear plan it's just a simple developing move.
448,15,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I believe this is best since it prepares to develop with Nf6.

450,15,5,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a classic Sicilian position where White opens the centre to get faster and easier development while Black is more cramped but has a solid position.

452,15,7,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq f3',White grabs a huge chunk of the centre but I am not worried since he is creating a lot of weaknesses. 
453,15,8,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Since I have an extra pawn in the centre I can establish a small central fortress White cannot penetrate without giving me an advantage. I prefer my position here since I am better structured and have no major weaknesses. White's weakened squares around the king may be a problem for him later. 
454,15,9,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is a normal move for White in Sicilian positions. There really isn't a better square for the bishop.
455,15,10,Qc7,b'rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Since I usually try for a Qc7 setup I guess playing a6 early wasn't that bad since I almost always play a6 anyway to control b5 so my queen cannot be harassed by a knight.
456,15,11,Be3,b'rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This move invites the poisoned pawn variation where I play Qb6 and White sacrifices the pawn to misplace my queen. But there is just too much studying to play into that when simple moves should give me an advantage due to my inpenetrable central fortress. 
457,15,12,b5,b'rnb1kb1r/2q2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq b6',This I think was a blunder since it overextends my position. I think b6 was better and more solid. I only played b5 because it threatens to win a pawn and gives me an initiative for a few moves but White has a simple defense.

My king is much more safe in the centre behind my small fortress where I can try to attack White's weak pawn with moves like Nc5.

Whenever White castles kingside in this opening I attack White's king with my h and g-pawns while my king's central fortress is untouched.

White should try keeping as much material on the board as possible so my extra piece won't be as advantageous as in an endgame

539,15,94,Bf8,b'5b2/8/5K2/6n1/5k2/8/8/8 w - -',Now that I have the White king where I want him I just need to make a waste move with my bishop to force the king off its square so that I can control that square once the king is off making the barrier tighter.

614,19,9,Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/3P4/2P1P3/P1N5/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',The rook lines up against white's king which is three moves from castling while the rook may not seem important now as there are four pieces between it and white's king these pieces are going to move almost immediately.
615,19,10,b5,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/4pn2/1p1P4/2P1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',And like in Suba game #1 black undermines white's center with a ...b5 advance.  What justifies this sacrifice?  White's king is still in the center so if the center opens up white will have some problems.  Also because white's bishop is not yet on g2 an opening up of the game will have black's bishop striking along the h1-a8 diagonal.  Finally black has a good way to open up his rook with ...exd5 and he has a developmental advantage due to the moves white spent with his pawns.
616,19,11,1cxb5,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/4pn2/1P1P4/4P3/P1N3P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',10.Nxb5 is met by 10... Nxe4 where the center still disintegrates this move is met by...

618,19,13,exd5,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P1p4/4N3/P5P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',And the center is gone without a trace.  The white king is looking awfully uncomfortable and the bishop is eying the white rook with a delighted grin.
619,19,14,1Nd2,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P1p4/8/P5P1/1P1NNP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',The knight retreats avoiding 12.Nc3 d4 forking the knight on c4 and the rook h1.
620,19,15,1d4,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P6/3p4/P5P1/1P1NNP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',But d4 comes anyway winning a tempo against the h1 rook.
621,19,16,1f3,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P6/3p4/P4PP1/1P1NN2P/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',White blocks the threat but his kingside pawns have some holes and black can now win back his piece.
622,19,17,1d3,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P6/8/P2p1PP1/1P1NN2P/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Due to the strong e file black wins back the piece if the knight moves 14.Nc3 he is struck by 14... Bc5  (discovered check) trapping the king when white will have to put a piece on e2 that will soon be taken by the black pawn on d3.
623,19,18,1Kf2,b'rn1qr1k1/pbppbppp/8/1P6/8/P2p1PP1/1P1NNK1P/R1BQ1B1R b - -',White sidesteps the pin but black is now equal in material when white's pieces are undeveloped and his pawns are discoordinated and weak.

626,19,21,1Bf8,b'rn1qrbk1/1bpp1ppp/p7/1P6/8/P4PP1/1P1NBK1P/R1BQR3 w - -',This is a safe square to put black's bishop on that lets the e8 rook into the game.  I'm sure 16... Bc5  was tempting but then white's king would be forced to the safer square g2 and the bishop might be a target of white's pieces: perhaps it would give white the needed time to get out of this mess.
627,19,22,1Rb1,b'rn1qrbk1/1bpp1ppp/p7/1P6/8/P4PP1/1P1NBK1P/1RBQR3 b - -',White needs a way to develop the c1 bishop but the knight is an important defender so white chooses to prepare b4 without losing a tempo to ...Qf6.  I think 16... Nf1 is a better way to get the bishop into the game the knight will soon go to f1 anyway and white doesn't have to play such an irrelevant looking move as Rb1.
628,19,23,1bxa6,b'rn2rbk1/1bpp1ppp/P4q2/8/8/P4PP1/1P1NBK1P/1RBQR3 b - -',White now trades hoping to show that the black knight will be useless on a6.
629,19,24,1b4,b'r3rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n4q2/8/1P6/P4PP1/3NBK1P/1RBQR3 b - b3',White plays his prepared advance with the intention of developing and locking black's knight out of the game.  It'll be very difficult to bring his knight into the game but he will find a wonderful way.
630,19,25,1Re6,b'r4bk1/1bpp1ppp/n3rq2/8/1P6/P4PP1/3NBK1P/1RBQR3 w - -',Black uses a rook lift preparing to double rooks on the important e file and Suba's ready to shuttle the rook along the sixth rank.

634,19,29,2Rae8,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r2q/8/1P6/P4PP1/1B2BK1P/1R1QRN2 w - -',Black concludes his basic development the e file is the only fully open file and as it has been this entire game it's very important.
635,19,30,2Qd2,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r2q/8/1P6/P4PP1/1B1QBK1P/1R2RN2 b - -',White offers a trade of queens if queens are off may be he can unravel his position.  This also connects rooks which shuts down a little of black's pressure on the e file.
636,19,31,2Qh3,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r3/8/1P6/P4PPq/1B1QBK1P/1R2RN2 w - -',Suba will not trade queens unless it comes with an explicit advantage the queen is quite strong on h3 it's the only safe square for it on the powerful h file.
637,19,32,2Bc4,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r3/8/1PB5/P4PPq/1B1Q1K1P/1R2RN2 b - -',White bring his bishop to an active square attacking black's rook but this weakens the defense of f3.  Note that while white's king may be weak he's getting development completed and his bishops look active.
638,19,33,2Qh5,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r3/7q/1PB5/P4PP1/1B1Q1K1P/1R2RN2 w - -',Black hits the weak f3 square a nice intermezzo (in-between move) before deciding what to do with the e6 rook.
639,19,34,2Qf4,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/n3r3/7q/1PB2Q2/P4PP1/1B3K1P/1R2RN2 b - -',White covers the weakness while adding some pressure to f7.  It seems that white has survived black's early attack as black has two pieces that aren't playing much of a role in the game the bishop on f8 and the knight on a6.  Black must activate or white has good chances here.
640,19,35,2Nc5,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/4r3/2n4q/1PB2Q2/P4PP1/1B3K1P/1R2RN2 w - -',!! If the rook on e6 is grabbed (25.Bxe6?) black will win with 25...Nd3 ! and a royal fork.  If the knight is taken (25.bxc5?) black will strike back with 25... Bxc5  and the king will be forced away from the defense of e1 where black will win a rook.  Because of these tactics the black knight can finally enter the game.
641,19,36,2g4,b'4rbk1/1bpp1ppp/4r3/2n4q/1PB2QP1/P4P2/1B3K1P/1R2RN2 b - -',White lashes out trying to knock away a menacing piece.

643,19,38,Na4,b'5bk1/1bpp1ppp/8/8/nPB3P1/P4PN1/1B5P/4K3 w - -',The knight moves with gain of tempo so that white has no time to shore up f3 and g4.

645,19,40,Bxf3,b'5bk1/2p2ppp/3p4/8/nPBB2P1/P4bN1/7P/4K3 w - -',And after 31 moves black has won a pawn.
646,19,41,3Bb5,b'5bk1/2p2ppp/3p4/1B6/nP1B2P1/P4bN1/7P/4K3 b - -',White's only asset is his passed a pawn so he knocks away the defender and tries to get the pawn to run.

649,19,44,3Kf2,b'5bk1/2p2ppp/3p4/1B1n4/PP1B2P1/5bN1/5K1P/8 b - -',White tries to get black's bishop off the h1-a8 diagonal so that the queening square of the a pawn is not blocked.  The ambitious 34.Bc6 (pinning the knight to the f3 bishop) loses to 34... Nxb4! 35.Bxf3 Nc2  36.Kd2 Nxd4 where black will win by blockading the dark squares with something like 37.a5 d5! 38.a6 Bc5 and white has nothing.
650,19,45,3a5,b'5bk1/2p2ppp/3p4/PB1n4/1P1B2b1/6N1/5K1P/8 b - -',The pawn marches for glory.
651,19,46,3Bc8,b'2b2bk1/2p2ppp/3p4/PB1n4/1P1B4/6N1/5K1P/8 w - -',And the pawn is stopped sadly for white he cannot continue with 36.a6 because of 36... Nxb4 where the pawn is attacked and must rashly move forward 37.a7 Bb7 and the pawn is stopped a last try like 38.Ba6 is met by 38...Ba8 where white is three pawns down.  So white resigned.  I hope you enjoyed the transitions in this game from a pawn sacrifice to the opening to a constantly pressuring middlegame followed by a trade of queens at just the right time to create a winning endgame.  For me Suba's ripping apart of the white center in the opening and 24... Nc5!! are the highlights of this game.  I hope you enjoyed and as always comments are great.

693,23,9,1Nc7,b'rnbq1rk1/p1n2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p5/3PP3/P1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I picked Nh7 over Nf6 thinking f5 may just be the site of our next shootout and I didn't want to restrict my f pawn.  Keep in mind I'm still thinking defense and want to go ahead and push my kingside pawns and rush pieces behind them. I realize now that this theory is flawed and that I need to up my Prozac.
694,23,10,1e5,b'rnbq1rk1/p1n2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p1P3/3P4/P1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White claims a nice spacial advantage and is preparing to coordinate an assault on my compound.
695,23,11,1Bb7,b'rn1q1rk1/pbn2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p1P3/3P4/P1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Rushing to catch up in development and trying to come up with a plan to start something on the queenside that will distract my good friend from my weakened castled position.

698,23,14,1Nh4,b'rnq1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p1P1B1/3P3N/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! Beautiful. I expected 15. Bf6 and then an h pawn push. My rival sees something that I miss - a knight sac on g6! If accepted white will have his queen and dark squared bishop hammering down on my isolated king.
699,23,15,1Nc6,b'r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p1p1/2p1P1B1/3P3N/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',? I had to do something to get developed but this was a poor choice. I think 15...Nd7 would have been better with the idea of action on f6. 
700,23,16,1Nxg6,b'r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p1N1/2p1P1B1/3P4/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! BAM! At this point I see the fallacy of taking the knight and start to get the inkling of an idea. I end up picking up material but didn't plan far enough ahead. It's the whole hind sight is 20/20 thing I know but I was kind of proud of the way the following combination worked out.
701,23,17,1cxd4,b'r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p1N1/4P1B1/3p4/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',The first move of a five move combination. While I achieve my goal of eliminating one of those pesky central pawns and accomplish that little picture in my head it is simply too little too late. About 5 moves ahead is my limit in tactical considerations and my friend mbingham proves that he can see just a little bit further:)
702,23,18,1Nf4,b'r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p3/4P1B1/3p1N2/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I think I caught my opponent a little off guard by not accepting the bait. So white simply protects his knight and plans to play Bxh7  which was probably his aim as far back as move 10.
703,23,19,1Nxe5,b'r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1p2p3/4n1B1/3p1N2/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',"Move 2 of the combination.  I have now ""won"" the other pesky central pawn."

I give myself the ! for the following reasons - 1) I'm not scared of a check by his dark squared bishop as I can easily evade to e7 which opens up my back rank for my major pieces to get mobile and swing over to the kingside to defend and 2) black MUST take my Ne5 next move because of the threat Nf3  which will win white's Bg5 AND could bring my queen into play via a6 which could be very painful for white. When white takes out my Ne5 I win a rook on move 20...BxR:)

709,23,25,2Bxh1,b'r1q1rk2/p1n2p1B/1p2p3/4P1B1/5N2/P7/2Q2P1P/R3K2b w Q -',Move 5 of my little combo and I have achieved my goal. I'm still in a boatload of trouble but it did feel good to see this work out as I envisioned it..............

White now has a beautiful mating net which involves four of his pieces vs. my lone king. While I hate losing as much as the next guy it really was cool to be involved in such a pretty mate:)

But now the white king has a rather airy position. Two moves before 19.Qc2 (instead of Qb3) might have solved this problem but white certainly wanted to aim his queen against black's king.

Be3 would have saved the game for white forcing the trade of the bishops and stopping black's kingside attack. Then it would not be easy to defend against white's following pawn roll-up in the center. I try b6 anyway.
773,25,23,2Bxb6,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/pB6/3Pp3/1P2Pb2/PQ3P1q/6R1/5RK1 b - -',In my opinion this move looses the game.
774,25,24,2Rd6,b'r5k1/5ppp/pB1r4/3Pp3/1P2Pb2/PQ3P1q/6R1/5RK1 w - -',Now it's too late for 30. Be3 because after ...Rg6 31. Bxf4 fails to ...Qxg2# (and 31.Rxg6 fails to ...Qh2#).
775,25,25,Rg6,b'r5k1/5ppp/p5r1/2BPp3/1P2Pb2/PQ3P1q/6R1/5RK1 w - -',"White resigned. 31. Rff2 is followed by Qh2  (the queen cannot be taken because the rook on g2 is pinned) 32. Kf1 and after ...Qh1  both 33. Ke2 or 33. Rg1 looses the rook. A lucky win!

I was so engrossed listening to them talk chess that I totally lost track of time. Good thing this tournament had long time controls! When I finally approached the board I noticed two main things - more than 20% of my time had already transpired and my opponent was obviously not very happy that I was late. So I simply looked at him and the clock one more time smiled and walked away to watch some other games for a bit. I figured that if I was already psyching him out I might as well try to put him on full tilt. I had the white pieces so I would at least have the initial advantage. I would simply play a system that I was very familiar with and play the opening very quickly. With over 45 minutes of my time now gone I return to the board and play my standard 1. d4.
777,26,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A standard response played very quickly. After this move and approximately the 15 or so to follow my opponent looks at the clock and smiles to himself. I'm betting that he is counting on his huge time advantage to carry the day. That is precisely what I want him to think - if he is concentrating more on his time than on his game I can steer the game into familiar territory for me and attempt to to play some themes that I have had much success with.
778,26,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Intending any variation of the QGA or QGD (my personal favorites).
779,26,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black intends the KID.
780,26,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',4...d5 is stronger IMHO. Black cedes white a little tempo.
781,26,5,h3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N1P/PP2PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',Given the time I go ahead and play a defensive move to stall the progress of black's light squared bishop.
782,26,6,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N1P/PP2PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',? Again 5...d5 was stronger.
783,26,7,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ e3',White claims the center. It is interesting to note that my last six moves were played in approximately 30 seconds.
784,26,8,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Black makes what seems to be a logical developing move but it has a very real weakness that white exploits.
785,26,9,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/3P4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',! I did spend about a minute on this one. The aim is to either harrass the Nc6 knight OR double black's pawns on the e file.
786,26,10,Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/3PN3/2P1P3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',As intended.
787,26,11,Be2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Developing and preparing 0-0.
788,26,12,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',? I didn't like this move at all for black. It does clear some space but it is a retreating move.
789,26,13,f5,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - f6',Whoa....black makes a huge commitment very early that weakens what was once a very solid castled position.
790,26,14,1Qb3,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Hitting b7 which slows down black's light squared bishop but just as importantly x-rays the black king.
791,26,15,1Rb8,b'1rbqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black prepares to develop his light squared bishop and/or start a queenside push.
792,26,16,1c5,b'1rbqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',! Stymying the Ne8 and preparing a discovered check.
793,26,17,1Kh8,b'1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black sees the check coming and sidesteps.
794,26,18,1Be3,b'1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN1B2P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b - -',This move was made with the hope that black would push his f pawn therefore closing down pawn threats in the center.
795,26,19,1f4,b'1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPp3/4Pp2/1QN1B2P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Black obliges. Again it is important to realize that my opponent is moving lightening quick to preserve his huge time advantage. I'm betting the farm that my experience in these type lines is greater than his. White now intends to play for a big space advantage.
796,26,20,g5,b'1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/8/2PPp1p1/4Pp2/1QN4P/PP1BBPP1/R4RK1 w - -',"Black just keeps pushing on the king side. The main problem for him is that this ""push"" is unsupported."
797,26,21,1g4,b'1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/8/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN4P/PP1BBP2/R4RK1 b - g3',I spent some time with this one. The idea was that if fxg e.p. I could trade rooks on the f file and own it after 15...fxg e.p. 16. fxg RxR 17. RxR.
798,26,22,1Rf6,b'1rbqn2k/ppp1p1bp/5r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN4P/PP1BBP2/R4RK1 w - -',This move caused me some pause as f6 is not a natural square for that rook. So.........
799,26,23,1f3,b'1rbqn2k/ppp1p1bp/5r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP1BB3/R4RK1 b - -',........I just go ahead and lock up the king side.
800,26,24,1c6,b'1rbqn2k/pp2p1bp/2p2r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP1BB3/R4RK1 w - -',OK - let's just consider d5. It is now and will become even more the central point of tension for the duration of the game. Both sides direct their forces around the future action on this square.
801,26,25,1Rfd1,b'1rbqn2k/pp2p1bp/2p2r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP1BB3/R2R2K1 b - -',Rook to half open file in support of the potentially volatile d5 square.
802,26,26,1Qc7,b'1rb1n2k/ppq1p1bp/2p2r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP1BB3/R2R2K1 w - -',"? Black made a move that was very strange to me. I figured he would play Nc7. But the really interesting part of this move has nothing to do with the position of the board. When he made it I promptly wrote it down looked at the position again then put a ""?"" next to the move on my score sheet. After about 5 minutes of looking at and scribbling on his own score sheet my opponent asked me if he could see mine. He evidently had lost track of the moves somewhere along the way and wanted to get the move order straight for himself. Without thinking about it I gave him my score sheet. He copied down my version of the game so far then gave me a very quizzical look. He had seen my ""?"" next to his 17th move. Big mistake on my part. I stood up scanned the room and caught the eye of my Life Master friend. As we are both smokers I gave him the international ""let's go smoke a cigarette"" hand sign and we went outside. Without going into the specifics of the game I told him what I had done. He just laughed at me took a long drag from his smoke and prepared to speak. I was hoping for some golden nugget of wisdom and all I got was ""You're an idiot. Learn the lesson and don't EVER do that again!"" Gee.....thanks Master:)"
803,26,27,1Be1,b'1rb1n2k/ppq1p1bp/2p2r2/2PPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP2B3/R2RB1K1 b - -',Feeling somewhat bummed for my lapse of common sense in score keeping I return to the board determined not to let it affect me. My position is still very good IMHO. 18. Be1 clears the d file and even prepares for action at h4.
804,26,28,1b5,b'1rb1n2k/p1q1p1bp/2p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP2B3/R2RB1K1 w - b6',Was black using the info he got from my sheet? I don't know but he certainly decided to rev things up on the queen side with this very aggressive push. I don't take e.p. because I want to keep my queen aimed at d5.
805,26,29,1Rd2,b'1rb1n2k/p1q1p1bp/2p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/1QN2P1P/PP1RB3/R3B1K1 b - -',Preparing to double rooks on the d file.

807,26,31,2a3,b'1r2n2k/p1q1p1bp/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/PQN2P1P/1P1RB3/R3B1K1 b - -',"I liked this move as it creates an ""escape square"" for the queen so she can still aim at d5 and I hope to eventually play b4 which will totally stall black's advance."
808,26,32,2Rd8,b'3rn2k/p1q1p1bp/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/PQN2P1P/1P1RB3/R3B1K1 w - -',Obviously black can't play cxd as an ugly knight fork will be his reward so he just continues to load up on d5.
809,26,33,2Rad1,b'3rn2k/p1q1p1bp/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/PQN2P1P/1P1RB3/3RB1K1 b - -',As do I.
810,26,34,2Qc8,b'2qrn2k/p3p1bp/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/PQN2P1P/1P1RB3/3RB1K1 w - -',Now may be the time that black uses the knowledge gained from looking at my score sheet and clears a square for his knight to develop to.
811,26,35,2Qc2,b'2qrn2k/p3p1bp/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/P1N2P1P/1PQRB3/3RB1K1 b - -',As I have more than enough ammo directed at d5 I keep my queen centralized and prepare to play the b4 that I was hoping for.
812,26,36,2Bf8,b'2qrnb1k/p3p2p/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/4PpP1/P1N2P1P/1PQRB3/3RB1K1 w - -',? A telling move. 22...Nc8 would have been much more effective. The tension on d5 still remains and black has now straddled himself with a weakend dark squared bishop whose true liability will be realized very soon.
813,26,37,2b4,b'2qrnb1k/p3p2p/b1p2r2/1pPPp1p1/1P2PpP1/P1N2P1P/2QRB3/3RB1K1 b - b3',Lock down!

815,26,39,2dxc6,b'2qr1b1k/p3p1np/b1P2r2/1pP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P1N2P1P/2QRB3/3RB1K1 b - -',! Time to start the fireworks! Black can't play 24...Rxc due to 25. RxR! he can't play 24...Qxc for the same reason. His only viable choice is to exchange rooks which still leaves white in control of the file.
816,26,40,2Qxd2,b'2q2b1k/p3p1np/b1P2r2/1pP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P1N2P1P/3QB3/3RB1K1 b - -',! Keeping the heat on the d file. The white queen now prepares to wreak havoc behind enemy lines.
817,26,41,2Rxc6,b'2q2b1k/p3p1np/b1r5/1pP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P1N2P1P/3QB3/3RB1K1 w - -',Logical but what about Ne6?. It is interesting to note that my opponent spent about 20 minutes on this move. The huge time advantage he once had is gone. Our clocks were now within a few minutes of each other:)
818,26,42,2Bxb5,b'2q2b1k/p3p1np/b1r5/1BP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P1N2P1P/3Q4/3RB1K1 b - -',Of course! The true weaknesses of the d5 conflict AND black's premature queenside push is realized. White now safely wins a pawn.
819,26,43,Qa6,b'5b1k/p3p1np/q1r5/1NP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P4P1P/3Q4/3RB1K1 w - -',Interesting and truth be told I wasn't counting on that. Black threatens to regain the pawn. However he must first deal with his very awkward piece placement.
820,26,44,2Qd8,b'3Q1b1k/p3p1np/q1r5/1NP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P4P1P/8/3RB1K1 b - -',Threatening mate on the next move.

822,26,46,2Qb8,b'1Q3b1k/p3p2p/q1r1n3/1NP1p1p1/1P2PpP1/P4P1P/8/3RB1K1 b - -',! White gets his queen right where he wanted her. Who cares if black goes pawn grabbing? Qe5  is the goal!

831,27,0,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I played this to get into less known territories than the Yugoslav attack which in some lines is 20 moves long.  I don't really want to get into a theory debate with my opponent. 
832,27,1,f3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2BNP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I must build up my central post e4 as the normal Sicilian break will be at d5.

834,27,3,1a4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p2p1np1/6B1/P1BNP3/2N2P2/1PPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ a3',This is not the greatest move.  My only thought was to provide a escape square for my bishop upon b5 and to take control of the dark squares on the queen side with a eventual a5 but this is to weakening for such a double-edged opening even more so that I had been thinking about castling long and pushing my king side pawns.
835,27,4,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/1pqnppbp/p2p1np1/6B1/P2NP3/2N2P2/BPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',This probably wasn't the best move as it leaves f7 weak and black will not be playing e5 anyways.  He should have developed his queen side.  I think that Nc5 would have been better.  If black can get his pieces out he will be better because of the weakening move a4 played by white (me)
836,27,5,1h4,b'r1b1r1k1/1pqnppbp/p2p1np1/6B1/P2NP2P/2N2P2/BPPQ2P1/R3K2R b KQ h3',Since it seemed that he wasn't making a counter in the center I decided to play on the wing that my pieces were aiming at.  The king side.  With the bishop on a2 when I play hxg6 he won't be able to play the sometimes superior fxg6 limiting his options.  This always helps when you are attacking since the less options he has the less you have to consider.
837,27,6,1Bh6,b'r1b1r1k1/1pq1ppbp/pn1p1npB/8/P2NP2P/2N2P2/BPPQ2P1/R3K2R b KQ -',Trying to get rid of the defender of the dark squares.  Normal for attacking the fienchetto.

If White tries to hold the pawn with 3.c4 then Black plays 3...c6 sacrificing a pawn for rapid development and superior control of the centre. The same player playing White sometimes plays that sacrifice as Black.

Taking that into account Black's king would be mated if a piece could check it somehow. There is a well-known mating pattern against Black's king's position where White sacrifices something to remove the b7-pawn so a bishop can get to a6 to deliver mate. Accomplishing that mating pattern doesn't appear to be possible but it could be since Qxc6 bxc6 Ba6 would be mate if Black's queen wasn't defending a6.

I wouldnt call Bb5 the best move but from the psychological point of view the character of the opening changes from very tactical to positional (mostly) . I dont mind playing all kinds of positions as long as my opponent feels uncomfortable with it.

That's the only move in order to make some progress. Otherwise the white bishop paralizes black's development.

Now black is lost. He should have kept the rooks on the board. But with a flag to fall one has the need to simplify. The rest is not so interesting any more. I didnt play very accurate and could have won quicker but i shall show it to the bitter end. "

I was very glad with how i handled the pressure before and during this game. Finnaly i should mention that both of us had 1 hour and 45 minutes for the first 40 moves and 15 minutes each for the rest of the game. I hope u enjoyed it as much as I did. If someone finds an improvement i'd be happy to hear it coz i didnt put it in the computer yet. Also i hope to hear why someone rated the game the way he did. Have a nice day folks

1019,36,0,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',This standard opening enjoys plenty of energy here -- Black's position is at this time very cramped and he cannot use his queen or bishops to their full potential for some time to come.  Though White's position will open further Black will not be allowed any time to initiate a meaningful attack.
1020,36,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2n5/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',! Invites a sactifice of the e-pawn.  In return White will hold the initiative beginning with the threat of mate on f7.

1022,36,3,Qf6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/7Q/2BNnP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This is perhaps not the best reply it's by no means very bad but there probably exist better moves.  The threat on White's knight is not intimidating for instance. Perhaps g7 is worthy of consideration and White will consider Qd5 to which there are clear answers.  Also worthy of consideration is Qe7 whereupon White will have to castle.  [Note Black's knight has lost a flight square Black's two bishops have yet to move both hemming in Black's rooks. In contrast White can quickly bring at least one rook into play. etc. etc.]
1023,36,4,1Qd5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/3Q4/2BNnP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Again a threat this time to the hanging knight.
1024,36,5,1Qh4+,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Q4/2BNnP1q/8/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Though uncastled and out in the open White's King is not at all easy to attack. This move alone perhaps consigns Black to hoping for a draw.  Compared to White Black is under-developed and so long as White's king sticks to black squares [Black's white square bishop can otherwise enter the game without cost whereas his other bishop has no part to play for now] Black will run out of checks. The White king will be chased to the 3rd rank and onto the Queen's side where he finds sanctuary behind White's developed pieces. The remaining White knight undoes the sequence of checks and covers several very important squares. White's defence (and attack) comprise entirely in maintaining the initiative from this point on.
1025,36,6,1g3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Q4/2BNnP1q/6P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',This sets in motion a premature attack from Black. It founders because once Black sacrifices his only knight Black has only one piece doing all the work.
1026,36,7,1Nf3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Q4/2B5/2K2Nq1/PPP5/R1B4R b kq -',White's king escapes check for the foreseeable future and his knight now covers some very useful squares -- not least e1 and g5 otherwise inaccessible because of Black's queen. [The pin to White's king is not relevant as only Black's queen is in play.]  White now must keep the initiative continuing to dictate play by (mating) threats. Black's King is vulnerable to a rook on e1. The square f7 must be covered. etc etc.
1027,36,8,1Bb5+,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/3pb3/1B1Q4/8/2K2Nq1/PPP5/R1B4R b kq -',Preferred to Re1 right away to prevent Black from castling his king.
1028,36,9,1c6,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2ppb3/1B1Q4/8/2K2Nq1/PPP5/R1B4R w kq -',? This is possibly natural but it does nothing to deter White.  It shows a lack of understanding for this position.  That said Black's position is unwelcome and I'm unsure if there is a very satisfactory reply. Perhaps Kd8 right away is best moving off the dangerous e-file. Even so there are still some unwelcome features -- for example Black very much wants to use the a1h8 diagonal to attack White's King. In the text Black next plays Ke7 though he may have done so without delay here.
1029,36,10,1Bg5+,b'r4b1r/pp2kppp/2Bpb3/3Q2B1/8/2K2Nq1/PPP5/R6R b - -',This connects up White's rooks with tempo.

By retreating the bishop to a less exposed square Geller avoids the fork with ...e4 and keeps his attacking potential intact.  The obvious drawback of this move is that a1-rook is cut off from play for a long time but as we shall see Black needs to display great ingeuity to take advantage of this detail."

However until very recently I have never played the closed systems of the Ruy Lopez.  And yet my feeling is that this move is an inaccuracy.  Black opens the diagonal of the white light-squared bishop too easily.

Later Keres started employing another more subtle method based on 15... Nd7 against both 15.Bd3 and 15.Bb1.  In case of a natural developing move such as 16.Ne3 he would release the tension in the centre with 16... exd5 in order to activate all his minor pieces.  The method of play looks especially effective against 15.Bb1 when white still has to justify the placement of his bishop.  The critical test probably consists of 16.d5 when Black can stir up huge complications with 16... f5 undermining the d5-pawn and activating his b7 bishop."
1094,38,6,exd4,b'2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p4n2/np1P4/3p4/5N1P/PP3PP1/RBBQRNK1 w - -',"?!  Since 16... e4 seems less effective now in view of 17.Ng5 Keres adopts a rather simplistic solution.  This attitude could have cost him dearly.  Later he came to the conclusion that this line should be continued a bit further with 17... Rfd8 18.Nxe4 Nxd5.  Indeed Black has definite compensation for the pawn in view of his excellent mobilization and White's problems developing his queenside (to which the b1-bishop belongs now).  As for a definitive evaluation of  this position tournament practice might some day give an answer.

After Keres's move White has a very promising position.  With the exception of the a1-rook all his pieces are well situated.  His minor pieces are targeting the enemy kingside the e1-rook keeps the e7-bishop under pressure and the queen is ready to join an eventual attack.  Black has some problems with his coordination.  His a5-knight is quite far from the king and can hardly be of any use in the eventuality of a lightning attack.  Even the seemingly active major pieces doubled on the c-file do not threaten anything serious.

With his next move Geller causes his opponent big problems with recuperating the d5-pawn."

Kxh7 20.Ng5  Kg6 21.Ng3! as given by Keres.  This is a superb illustration of the force displayed by White's minor pieces in combination with the queen.  The bishops were employed to eliminate important defenders and to create disharmony in Black's camp while the knights offer the queen reliable support in the hunt for the king.  The immediate threat is 22.Qh5  Kf6 23.Nh7# while after 21... Rh8 22.Qg4  the threat of Ne6  hitting both g7 and c7 is impossible to parry adequately since 22... f5 allows 23.Re6# while 22... Kf6 is strongly met by 23.h4! placing the g5 square under control and creating decisive threats such as Re6  or Nh7  followed by Qg5#.

Keres took what looked like a reasonable decision:"

However Keres correctly points out that this natural move should have been the losing mistake.  However he is too optimistic when considering Black's position as entirely satisfactory after 17... Rfe8.  This is a good move but the problem is that Black has already gone wrong and there are no completely satisfactory options available to him any more.  Curiously contemporary theory is not too well settled here:

a) ECO gives 18.Qd3 as winning but black seems able to survive with 18... Kf8!  (ECO only  mentions 18... g6? when after 19.Rxe7 Qxe7 20.Qxd4 White obtained an overwhelming attack in Ernst-Hedman Avesta 1993) acknowledging that the infiltration of the queen to h7 is not dangerous in itself if it does not lead to an immediate mate. (note: there's a reference here to another game in the book that I've taken out of this annotation)  After 19.Bxf6 (19.Nxd4 can now be met by 19... h6!? followed by the capture on d5) 19... Bxf6 we suddenly see the drawback of the retreating the bishop to b1: the lack of coordination between the rooks and the weakness of the first rank prevent white from obtain anything concrete.  For instance 20.Qa3 (the most ambitious move but probably not the best; White should probably admit that he has no advantage with either 20.Qxh7 Rxe1 21.Nxe1 Bxd5 or 20.Rxe8  Rxe8 21.Qxh7 Bxd5; in fact I would prefer black in both cases) 20... Be7 21.Rxe7 (this is intended to be a strong tactical blow) 21... Qxe7 22.Qxa5 White has managed to win material but after 22... Rc1 23.Qd2 Qc5 his queenside is completely paralyzed.  Once again the usefulness of the move ...Kf8 is obvious: White cannot take on h7 with check.

b) 18.Qxd4 seems to be a better solution.  After 18... Nxd5 19.Bf5 Rxd8 20.Rac1 Nc6 21.Qh4 white completes his development and retains strong pressure.  This has occured in some correspondence games.  We now return to 17... h6?:"

White's play so far has been quite logical and once can sense the danger looming over Black's position.  I am pretty sure that Geller was looking for a tactical crowing of his superior strategy and that the sacrifce 18.Bxh6! didn't escape his attention.  After 18... gxh6 the relatively 'quiet' move 19.Qd2 gives Black unsolvable problems.  Once again the combined action of the queen and the minor pieces has devastating effect.  Keres gives the following analysis: 19... Rfd8 (aiming to clear the way for the king and activate the rook via the fifth rank; both 19... Bxd5 20.Qxh6 Bxf3 21.Ng3! followed by Nf5 or in some cases Nh5 and 19... Kg7 20.Ng3 Ng8 21.Nf5  Kh8 22.Nxe7! are hopeless for Black) 20.Qxh6 Rxd5 21.Re4! (as Keres indicates 21.Ng3 is less clear in view of 21... Bf8! 22.Qxf6 Bg7 23.Qh4 d3 when White suddenly has problems with his queenside while the black king has relative safety) 21... Rh5 22.Rg4  (eliminating the h5-rook which is the key defender of the king) 22... Nxg4 23.Qxh5 Nf6 24.Qg5  Kf8 25.Qh6  Ke8 (or if 25... Kg8 then 26.Ng5 followed by Bh7  Bg6  and Bxf7 ) and now the simple threat of 26.Bf5 completing development and threatening Qh8  or Re1 is decisive.

However calculating everything over the board is not easy here and after some time he might have asked himself whether there wasn't any simpler solution available.  Then he must discovered the variation actually played in the game up the the 22nd move and decided this was a better practical decision being competely risk-free.   If my supposition is right Geller would have needed just an effort of will to follow his instinct since Keres considers the rejection of the sacrifice with 28.Rfd8 to be the lesser evil although he agrees that after 19.Bg5 Rxd5 20.Qd3 g6 21.h4 white has a nice attacking position.  Although these variations are quite instructive the most interesting phase of the game is still to come."

However it is perfectly understandable that such an approach obviously aiming for equality didn't appeal to Geller.  At the same time it is no longer entirely clear that white can equalize completely.  Indeed the position of the b1-bishop will not be easy to improve while the a5-knight just needs to jump once (to c4) to join the rest of the well-centralized black army.

note: It seems to me that white is (and has been) excellently placed for an attack but if the attack doesn't pan out quickly then his pieces will be dis-coordinated and two (besides rooks) will be awkwardly placed on the back rank."

Black's minor pieces are perfectly coordinated for an attack against the enemy king.  For instance in case of 22.Nxg6? fxg6 23.Qxg6  Qg7 white cannot regain his sacrificed piece with 24.Qe6  Kh8 25.Bxd6 due to 25... Nf4 (as indicated by Keres).

The queen delivers a double attack and in the case of the 'practically forced' 22... Nc4 White would get excellent attacking chances with 23.Qxh6 threatening Ng5 followed by Re6 or maybe h4.  We cannot really blame Geller for being seduced by such a simple combination when rejecting the combinative 18.Bxh6!.  Who knows if he had had the same position in his game against Velimirovic maybe chess history would have had one masterpiece fewer.

Unlike his opponent Keres clearly heard the bell ringing as a sign that the white bishop had been on b1 too long and siezed the opportunity to change the course of the game radically:"

Geller could have still avoided immediate trouble with 23.Be4 preventing the bishop from being cut off from the play with ...d3 but he was no psychologically ready to switch to passive defense.  Heres writes that he intended to continue with 23... Nc4 keeping the more active pieces in an almost symmetrical position rather than 23... Nc6 when 24.Ne5 offers white some compensation for the pawn.
1102,38,14,Nxh3+,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p2q2pp/Qp6/3p4/5P1n/PP3P2/RB2RNK1 w - -',For the next few moves the white king will be defended only by a knight and two doubled pawns obviously a poor match for the tandem of queen and knight.  Besides Black needs just one tempo to include his c8 rook in the attack.  No wonder that everything works out perfectly from a tactical point of view as the comments based on Keres's variations (see below) clearly show.
1103,38,15,2Kg2,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p2q2pp/Qp6/3p4/5P1n/PP3PK1/RB2RN2 b - -',"White feels like driving the knight back.  In case of 25.Kh1 Qf4 he is equally helpless:

a) The attempt to include the bishop in the attack leaves the c2-square without defense (the only good the bishop has been doing this game) after 26.Be4 Nxf2  27.Kg1 (or similarly 27.Kg2 Nxe4 followed by ...Rc2 ) 27... Nxe4 28.Rxe4 Qxf3 followed by ...Rc2.

b) 26.Nh2 places the knight on a vulnerable square and leaves White without the possibility of defending the g-file with Ng3 in case of 26... Nxf2  27.Kg2 Rc5 or 26...Rc5 at once.

c) 26.Kg2 seeks to create disharmony in Black's army based on the fact that the f4-square is temporarily unavailable to the knight.  However this fails.  After the simple 26... Qh4 the threat of ...Nf4  followed by ...Qh4 cannot be parried adequately; for instance 27.Qd2 (or 27.Nh2 Nf4  28.Kh1 Qxf2 29.Rg1 Rc1! mating; in case of 27.Re4 Qxf2  28.Kxh3 Qxf1  Black has three pawns for the bishop while the white queenside is paralyzed for ever) 27... Nf4  28.Kg1 Qg5  29.Ng3 and now the vulnerable position of the white queen allows 29... Nh3  followed by 30... Qxd2."
1104,38,16,Nf4+,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p2q2pp/Qp6/3p1n2/5P2/PP3PK1/RB2RN2 w - -',note: repetitions like this are common in GM play it gives a little time to think and tests if the other player is going to do something silly.
1105,38,17,Qd5,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p5pp/Qp1q4/3p1n2/5P2/PP3P2/RB2RNK1 w - -',! Black is not interested in repeating moves once more.  The immediate threat is 29... Qxf3 30.Be4 Ne2  with a material advantage.

Qh3 is 30.Qd2 attacking the knight but then 30... Qg5  31.Ng3 Nh3  wins the queen in a familiar way.  29.Re4 leaves the back rank undefended allowing 29... Qg5  30.Ng3 Rc1 .  Keres ends his variations here but for the sake of clarity the moves 31.Re1 Qh4! should be added.  The threat of ...Qh3 is decisive.
1107,38,19,2d3,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p5pp/Qp1q4/5n2/3p1PN1/PP3P2/RB2R1K1 w - -',! Having taken control of the e2-square Geller intends to meet 29... Qxf3 with 30.Be4.  With the last move Keres definitively cuts the bishop out of play renewing the threat of ...Qxf3.  White is simply helpless.
1108,38,20,3Ne4,b'2r2rk1/5p2/p5pp/Qp1q4/4Nn2/3p1P2/PP3P2/RB2R1K1 b - -',By taking control of g5 and threatening a deadly check on f6 White slows down the attack for just one tempo.

The other possibility is 31.Qd2 when after 31... Rc4! the threat of ...Rxe4 is decisive; for instance 32.Qe3 (32.Bxd3 Rd8 33.Re3 leads to familiar motifs after 33... Rxe4 34.fxe4 Qg5  35.Rg3 Nh3 ! winning the queen while 32.Re2 blocks the c1-h6 diagonal allowing 32... Qh3 followed by mate) 32... Rxe4 33.fxe4 Qg4  34.Qg3 d2! 35.Bc2 dxe1=Q  36.Rxe1 Ne2  winning even more material."

The other more tempting way to attack the e4-knigh is 31... Rc4 but this was probably what Geller was hoping for when making his previous move sice after 32.Qd6 Rxe4 33.Rxe4 Qg5 34.Kf1 White can hang on for a while.

After 31... Rfe8! the same variation leads to mate after 34... Rc1  while other moves also fail to save the game: 32.Bxd3 (or 32.Ng3 Qh3 when the white queen cannot simultaneously defend the e1-square and eliminate the f4 knight) 32... Rxe4 33.Rxe4 Qg5  34.Kf1 Qg2  35.Ke1 and now after 35... Nxd3  is suddenly appears that the queen is no less vulnerable on b4 than it would be on d2.

It is curious that Keres doesn't mention this minor difference.  It is possible that during the game his intuition simpy dictated him to play 31... Rfe8 and that he didn't consider it necessary to search for anything else."
1111,39,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Here's a nice miniature for Suba this game is in the English (same as the last one) but in this game Suba takes the white side.  While I don't think this is anywhere near as fantastic an overall game it's enjoyable in the simplicty and forceful nature of the attack.  Also Suba's willingness to move his king is quite enjoyable to watch.  Black also spends seven unimpressive turns (out of 15) maneuvering his knight from g8 to d8.
1112,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sax chooses the symmetrical variation I see the type of positions that arise from this as quite drawish but Suba clearly thinks differently.
1113,39,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A natural move.

1116,39,5,Nb4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p5/1n2P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So black's knight has moved for the third time and it finally has a threat Nd3  which would either displace white's king or win the two bishops.

1120,39,9,Nf4+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2B1Pn2/2N2N2/PP1PKPPP/R1BQ3R w kq -',The knight retreats with check but this only forces the white king to a more comfortable square and black will have to spend another turn retreating his knight as it's awkwardly placed on the white dark squared bishop's diagonal.
1121,39,10,Kf1,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2B1Pn2/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1K1R b kq -',The king is happy to return to the back rank.  While it may prove difficult to connect rooks for now white's development lead is huge.

White's got all the fun in this position as black is cramped and undeveloped his one developed piece is on e6 stopping his other pieces from entering the game.

Finally the knight leaves the e6 square which only served to slow down black's own development.  The knight may have been a waste of multipe tempo but it's not so awful on d8 as it gives c6 and f7 some cover- it proves to not be enough but that's because it's the only decent defender.

Nxf7 17.Qxc6  black has two equally miserable choices 17... Bd7 18.Qxd7# and 17... Kd7 18.Nxf7 .  I hope you enjoyed this quick convincing miniature the game is not a masterpiece but it's fun and it shows the danger of moving a piece far too much in the opening.  As always if you have any comments I'd love to hear them.  The next Suba game will be deeper I promise.
