139,3,2,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't like this move: it blocks up Black's position though it has potential for varied knight activity.
140,3,3,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',I adopt an aggressive approach to limit Black's scope for activity.
141,3,4,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So now we're in Robatsch territory which I've always enjoyed attacking.

143,3,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black's castling completes his kingside development but his centre and queenside need some work.
144,3,7,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/4P3/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Now I seize the opportunity to disrupt Black's plans with a quick central thrust before I have castled reasoning that my King is safe for now and Black needs to respond accurately or suffer.
145,3,8,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/pppnppbp/3p2p1/4P3/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',? Black retreats the N passively to e8 overlooking White's response.  He should have swapped on e5 immediately.
146,3,9,e6,b'r1bqnrk1/pppnppbp/3pP1p1/8/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The pawn thrusts into the heart of Black's position forking the Nd7 and the pawn on f7.  If Black plays fxe6 Bxe6+ follows. But this would have been preferable to Black's actual reply.
147,3,10,d5,b'r1bqnrk1/pppnppbp/4P1p1/3p4/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',? This just gives up a pawn for nothing.

155,3,18,1Bg4,b'r3n1k1/ppp2qbp/1n4p1/8/3P1Pb1/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black develops his B aggressively pinning my N against my Q and thus threatening to capture on d4 with check.
156,3,19,1Qf2,b'r3n1k1/ppp2qbp/1n4p1/8/3P1Pb1/2N2N2/PPP2QPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I sidestep the pin and over-defend the d pawn.
157,3,20,1Bxf3,b'r3n1k1/ppp2qbp/1n4p1/8/3P1P2/2N2b2/PPP2QPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I hadn't expected Black to start swapping off while material down but this looks like winning the d-pawn.
158,3,21,1Qxf3,b'r3n1k1/ppp2qbp/1n4p1/8/3P1P2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I recaptured with the Q because I didn't want doubled f-pawns.  Now I also threaten the pawn on b7.
159,3,22,1Nd6,b'r5k1/ppp2qbp/1n1n2p1/8/3P1P2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black redevelops his backward N and defends b7 once more threatening to capture on d4 and also threatening to advance an N to c4 whence he can threaten White's position.
160,3,23,1Be3,b'r5k1/ppp2qbp/1n1n2p1/8/3P1P2/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',This developing move defends the d pawn but now ...Nc4 would have forked the Be3 and pawn on b2.  Alternatively ...Nf5 would have forked Be3 and pawn on d4 when I planned Bf2
161,3,24,1Qf5,b'r5k1/ppp3bp/1n1n2p1/5q2/3P1P2/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Now Black threatens my pawn on c2. 
162,3,25,1Rac1,b'r5k1/ppp3bp/1n1n2p1/5q2/3P1P2/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/2R2RK1 b - -',I preferred this to Rf2 which would have prepared doubling on the f-file as well as defending the pawn because I wanted to keep f2 for my B if I got time to move it.  Now an immediate ...Nc4 would have been annoying.
163,3,26,1Re8,b'4r1k1/ppp3bp/1n1n2p1/5q2/3P1P2/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black preferred to complete his development and occupy the open file before venturing forward with his Ns.  Despite the lost material Black's position looked quite harmonious a this point and I was struggling to defend all my weak points.

Now my plan is to double rooks on the e-file and penetrate the heart of Black's position.
174,3,37,2h4,b'3r2k1/pp3qb1/2pn2p1/3n4/3P1P1p/1PP2QN1/P2B2PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Black continues his thrust merely forcing me to move my N to where I want it anyway.

177,3,40,2Ng5,b'3r2k1/pp3qb1/2p3p1/3n1nN1/3P1P1p/1PP2Q2/P2B2PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Continuing my slow but steady advance on Black's position and harrassing his Q again.
178,3,41,2Qf6,b'3r2k1/pp4b1/2p2qp1/3n1nN1/3P1P1p/1PP2Q2/P2B2PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Overlooking my reply but any move would have allowed Ne6 further disrupting his position.

180,3,43,2Qf8,b'3r1qk1/pp4b1/2p1R1p1/3n1nN1/3P1P1p/1PP2Q2/P2B2PP/2R3K1 w - -',At least the Q and R can't now be forked because the R occupies the forking square ...
181,3,44,2Rxg6,b'3r1qk1/pp4b1/2p3R1/3n1nN1/3P1P1p/1PP2Q2/P2B2PP/2R3K1 b - -',but not for long!

183,3,46,2Re1,b'5qk1/pp1r2b1/2p3R1/3n1nN1/3P1P1p/1PP2Q2/P2B2PP/4R1K1 b - -',I wanted to play Qh5 immediately but couldn't see a good continuation after ...Nf6.

185,3,48,3Qh5,b'5qk1/pp1rn1b1/2p3R1/5nNQ/3P1P1p/1PP5/P2B2PP/4R1K1 b - -',and Black resigned as he felt his position was hopeless.  He could have prolonged things slightly with  30. ...Qe8 31. Qh7+ Kf8 32. Ne6+ Kf7 33. Nxg7 Nxg6 (33...Nxg7 34. Qxg7 mate) 34. Nxe8+ Kxe8 35. Qxg6+ Kd8 (35. Qg8+ Nf8) when Black has avoided mate but is a whole Q down.  Very satisfying for me and depressing for Tom.  The game had lasted just over an hour.
186,4,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',English opening.  Provides the queen access to the field and all the major responses look favorable to white.
187,4,1,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White does ok with Nc3 here.
188,4,2,d3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Pd3 however seems to favor black in the database.
189,4,3,a5,b'rn1qkbnr/1bpppppp/1p6/p7/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq a6',Pa5 is not in the database.  Black seems to do ok with Pe5 instead but not many games with this variation are recorded in the database yet.
190,4,4,Ng8,b'rn1qkbnr/1bpppppp/1p6/p5B1/2P1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Generally speaking returning a piece does not promote development.  Black would have been better off with Pe6 or Pe7 here which lets the queen protect the knight.  Let white trade--white drops behind in development when the black queen advances into the field.
191,4,5,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/1bpppp2/1p5p/p7/2P1P1p1/2NP1NB1/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Uh no.  Nd2 or even better Ne5.  Be2 allows PxNf3.
192,4,6,Bg7,b'rn1qk1nr/1bppppb1/1p5p/p7/2P1P1p1/2NP1NB1/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Ok Ne5 is out but Nd2 remains viable.
193,4,7,1Nh4,b'rn1qk1nr/1bppppb1/1p5p/p7/2P1P1pN/2NP2B1/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',...or Nh4.  Actually this is probably better than Nd2.  I like it.  Black can play Pd6 to attack the knight with the queen--but with the bishop protecting it the attack is pretty weak.
194,4,8,1e6,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp1pb1/1p2p2p/p7/2P1P1pN/2NP2B1/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Now the white h knight has nowhere to move and the bishop is stuck protecting it which prevents Pg3.  On the other hand--free pawn.  Bxg4 is looking great!
195,4,9,1Bxg4,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp1pb1/1p2p2p/p7/2P1P1BN/2NP2B1/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Yeehaw!

197,4,11,e5,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp2b1/1p5p/p3pP2/2P3BN/2NP2B1/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I'm getting a thrill thinking about Ng6.  Rh7 protects the black rook followed by NxPe5.  White's black bishop protects the knight and white gains yet another pawn point.
198,4,12,1O-O,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp2b1/1p5p/p3pP2/2P3BN/2NP2B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This could have waited.  As Archduke_Piccolo noted in the comments Bh5+ forces Ke7 or Kf8 either of which white replies with Ng6+ and then picks off Rh8.
199,4,13,1Nf6,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp2b1/1p3n1p/p3pP2/2P3BN/2NP2B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Ng6 still looks good but as AP notes Bh5+ remains perfectly viable.  NxB QxN+ followed by Ke7 or Kf8--either of which Ng6+ and the black rook falls.
200,4,14,1Nd5,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp2b1/1p3n1p/p2NpP2/2P3BN/3P2B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Black has two pieces protecting that square.  White ends up losing a pawn point in this exchange.  Better would be Re1.  White might also think BxPe5.  NxBg4 QxN BxB.  We see black comes out ahead of white seizes that wayward pawn.
201,4,15,1Nxg4,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp2b1/1p5p/p2NpP2/2P3nN/3P2B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Wrong piece.  Although QxN BxN PxB leaves white's pawns doubled.
202,4,16,c6,b'rn1qk2r/1b1p2b1/1pp4p/p2NpP2/2P3QN/3P2B1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',QxB looks good here.  Black will have to move the rook Rf8 and white can move in one of the knights.  Things begin looking grim for black.
203,4,17,1Ne3,b'rn1qk2r/1b1p2b1/1pp4p/p3pP2/2P3QN/3PN1B1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Oh no QxB was SO much better.  That knight was fine where it was.  The bishop was free!

311,6,48,2Bh6,b'r1b3r1/1p1qk2p/pb3p1B/3ppP2/1P1P2P1/1BP2R1P/P3N2K/R7 b - -',I retreat my bishop.

321,6,58,3Bc4,b'r1b1r3/1p5p/pb1k1p1B/5P2/1PBP1pP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 b - -',I retreat my attacked bishop.

323,6,60,3Bxf4+,b'r1b1r3/1pb4p/p2k1p2/5P2/1PBP1BP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 b - -',So I take.

325,6,62,3Be6+,b'r1b1r3/1pbk3p/p3Bp2/5P2/1P1P1BP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 b - -',I throw in a check.
326,6,63,3Kd8,b'r1bkr3/1pb4p/p3Bp2/5P2/1P1P1BP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 w - -',King retreats.
327,6,64,3d5,b'r1bkr3/1pb4p/p3Bp2/3P1P2/1P3BP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 b - -',So I have three pawns for a rook I have nearly equalized.
328,6,65,3Bxe6,b'r2kr3/1pb4p/p3bp2/3P1P2/1P3BP1/2P2R1P/P6K/8 w - -',She takes

333,6,70,3c4,b'r3r3/1p2k2p/p3Pp2/3P4/1PP2RP1/7P/P6K/8 b - -',I secure my pawn center.
334,6,71,3b6,b'r3r3/4k2p/pp2Pp2/3P4/1PP2RP1/7P/P6K/8 w - -',PMCA suggests Kd6 37. Rf5 b6 38. Rxf6 b5 39. e7+ Kxe7 40. Re6+ Kd7 41. Rxe8 Rxe8 42. c5 Re5 43. d6 Re2+ 44. Kg3 Rxa2 45. Kf4 Rd2 instead but I don't think it makes much difference.
335,6,72,3Kg3,b'r3r3/4k2p/pp2Pp2/3P4/1PP2RP1/6KP/P7/8 b - -',I advance my king.
336,6,73,3Rad8,b'3rr3/4k2p/pp2Pp2/3P4/1PP2RP1/6KP/P7/8 w - -',She finally mobilizes her last rook.

Rf3 Rb8 45. a3 Rc8 46. Rc3 h6 47. h4 is better but this can't be right. Centralizing the king must be ok and I can't understand why in this line black just gives up the f pawn? "

341,6,78,4Kf5,b'3r2r1/4k3/pp2Pp1p/3P1K2/1PP2RP1/7P/P7/8 b - -',This is a great mistake my king is needed in the center and on the queen side.
342,6,79,4a5,b'3r2r1/4k3/1p2Pp1p/p2P1K2/1PP2RP1/7P/P7/8 w - -',She starts to break up my pawn formation.
343,6,80,4a3,b'3r2r1/4k3/1p2Pp1p/p2P1K2/1PP2RP1/P6P/8/8 b - -',I try to hold the line.

355,6,92,4Rc5,b'6r1/8/3rkp1p/2R5/1P2K1P1/7P/8/8 b - -',I avoid the rook exchange.
356,6,93,4Rb6,b'6r1/8/1r2kp1p/2R5/1P2K1P1/7P/8/8 w - -',She goes after the pawn
357,6,94,4b5,b'6r1/8/1r2kp1p/1PR5/4K1P1/7P/8/8 b - -',I advance it.

359,6,96,4Rh5,b'r7/8/1r2kp1p/1P5R/4K1P1/7P/8/8 b - -',I go after her h pawn.

363,6,100,5Rxh6,b'8/8/1r2kp1R/1P6/1r4P1/5K1P/8/8 b - -',So I take her h pawn.
364,6,101,5Rb6xb5,b'8/8/4kp1R/1r6/1r4P1/5K1P/8/8 w - -',and my b pawn goes. I did have dreams of hiding my king on h4 here but she can just line up both rooks on the 3rd rank and win my h pawn so I decided to push it. It probably hastened my defeat but the position is pretty hopeless now anyway. 
365,6,102,5h4,b'8/8/4kp1R/1r6/1r4PP/5K2/8/8 b - -',So I push my passed pawn.
366,6,103,5Ra5,b'8/8/4kp1R/r7/1r4PP/5K2/8/8 w - -',She now has a simple mating pattern. No need to further comment.

407,9,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I have bee experimenting with the Center Counter (Scandinavian) Defense as an alternative to the French Defense and other fairly rock-ribbed defenses.  Especially when its reputation seems to be a bit suspect both for the early forced arrival of the black queen to the center and also for the easy development for white that buys time to build a strong position.  And yet it does not die making me think that if grandmasters play it then I can certainly try it.
408,9,2,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The first surprise.  I was expecting the conventional 3. Nc3 Qd6 or Qa5 etc.

From my research it appeared there were many instances of this very sequence in grandmaster practice.  Does an early queen trade presage an early draw?  In those games and in this there is little opportunity for a draw.  I also considered 4...Qh5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. O-O  0-0-0  7. d3  Nf6 8. h3 Bd7 9. Bf4 Qf5 10. Bg3 g5 11. a4 h5 12. h4 gxh4 13. Nxh4 Qh7 from Westphal-Kiel Landesliga Ost in 2002.  Kiel won this game but only after some serious torture in the middle-game.

414,9,8,e5,b'r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/6b1/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq e6',Once white has played 7. d3 which locks in his king's bishop I saw no reason to hold back 7...e5.  7...e5 restrains his 8. Bf4 and the problems on c7 that occur after 9. Nb5.  Of course 8. Nb5 is still possible and it seems to force 8...Rc8.  So it may be that 7...a6 before 8....e5 is best.

He cannot venture anywhere unless he either sacrifices his knight for the advanced pawns or otherwise stops the pawns in their tracks.  In the meantime the black king is a foot soldier that cannot be stopped.  The black knight is ideally placed to fence in the white monarch until the black king can advance to support the pawns.

483,11,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is one of those heavily-analyzed King's Indian Defense variations.  It is called the Gligoric-Taimanov system in ECO E92.  It often produces very dynamic games with chances for both sides. And the field can shift from queen-side to king-side or can exist on both sides simultaneously.  This game shows how a heavy queen-side attack can shift suddenly to the king-side.

489,11,6,2Qb3,b'r2q1rk1/p4nbp/bp1p2n1/1N1Pp1p1/PRP1Pp2/1Q3P1P/3NBBP1/5RK1 b - -',I am planning 22. Nxa7 Rxa7 23. Bxb6 Qd7 24. Bxa7 Qxa7+ 25. Rb6 Rb8 26. Rb1 with a lot of pressure.  But then I saw a better move to crack open the queen-side. 
490,11,7,2cxb5,b'r2q1rk1/p4nb1/3p2n1/pP1Pp1pp/R3Pp2/1Q3P1P/3NBBP1/5RK1 b - -',The two bishops now spring to life.

492,11,9,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/pq3nb1/3p2n1/pP1Pp1pp/2R1Pp2/1Q3P1P/3NBBP1/2R3K1 w - -',He correctly sees the weakness of the d-pawn and my chance to break through in the center.  But the computer prefers 26...Bf6. 
493,11,10,3Nc4,b'rq4k1/p2n1n2/2Rp1b2/QP1Pp1pp/2N1Pp2/5P1P/4BBP1/6K1 b - -',This is the main reason I played 30. R1c6.  It draws a bead on the d-pawn.

495,11,12,3Nxd6,b'r2b2k1/p2n1n2/2RN4/1q1Pp1pp/4Pp2/Q4P1P/4BBP1/6K1 b - -',The computer prefers 34. Rxd6 Nxd6 35. Qxd6 Nf8 36. Qxe5 Qd7 37. d6.  But I could only think about a direct assault on the black king now.  Funny how a fixation like that can change the course of a game so much.
496,11,13,Nf6,b'r2b4/p4k2/2RQ1n2/3Pp1pp/4Pp2/5P1P/4qBP1/6K1 w - -',In most variations in the computer analysis 36....Nf8 seems to cover the attack squares that the white queen has.  And the knight being on f6 now sets up a pretty combination.
497,11,14,Qd1+,b'r2b4/p4k2/2R2n2/3PQ1pp/4Pp2/5P1P/5BP1/3q2K1 w - -',With this move black sets up a sequence that can force a perpetual check or at worst a pin on the bishop that keeps the bishop tied to the first rank all to prevent the perpetual check.  So if it succeeds it can badly compromise the coming attack on black's king.  From now on I must keep my bishop free to participate in the coming attack.  
498,11,15,3Bd4,b'r2b4/5k2/2R2n2/p2PQ1pp/3BPp2/5P1P/6PK/3q4 b - -',This sets up the combination which leads to checkmate.  It also entices his queen to play for the perpetual check on the squares e1 and f3.
499,11,16,3Qe1,b'r2b4/5k2/2R2n2/p2PQ1pp/3BPp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 w - -',It seems the only way to stop the coming attack is for him to sacrifice his queen for the bishop with 39...Qxd4. 
500,11,17,4Rxf6+,b'r2b4/5k2/5R2/p2PQ1pp/3BPp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',An 11-move (or shorter) checkmate now commences.  There are some tricks in the coming sequence of checks that are very instructive.
501,11,18,4Qg6+,b'r3k3/8/6Q1/p2P2pp/3BPp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',"Sloppy play by me (with his king escaping from the checks for just one move) is enough for him to tie up the bishop on g1 starting with ....Qf3+ and then ....Qe1+.  So every check must count now successfully to drive his king to the ""coffin corner."" The purpose of 42. Qg6+ is to drive his king to the queen-side for an easy box-in type of mate."
502,11,19,4Kd7,b'r7/3k4/6Q1/p2P2pp/3BPp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 w - -',If 42...Kd8 then 43. Bb6+ Ke7 44. Bc5+ Kd8 45. Qf6+ etc.  Yes I could instead play 43. Qc6+ and pick up his rook but the mate sequence then disappears and a much longer game ensues.
503,11,20,4Qd6+,b'rk6/8/1B1Q4/p2P2pp/4Pp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',The step by step pattern with the queen fencing in the king continues.  As long as the bishop stays on the g1-a7 diagonal for most of this process it will be effective in the fencing process too. 
504,11,21,4Qc6+,b'r7/1k6/1BQ5/p2P2pp/4Pp2/5P1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',Not 46. Qc7+ because the checks would have to stop after 46....Ka6.  Also note that the exposed white d-pawn is instrumental in giving the white queen the base of operations for this attack.

506,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hot on the previous night's lucky win for the 1st Team last night was a return to Earth with this exciting game lost in a rush of blood to the head on my part.  I open with my usual 1. e4 - I prefer tactical scrambles to strategic tussles on the whole even though I'm prone to slipping up in the process ...
507,12,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian an opening to prefer to play as Black as it's very resourceful in counter-attacking options.
508,12,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
509,12,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I've liked this move ever since I went to see the 17th game in the Short - Kasparov World Championship match in London.  6. Bg5 is probably the most common alternative though the English Attack characterised by f3 and Be3 is also very popular.
510,12,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Confirming the Najdorf rather than the Dragon (6....g6).
511,12,5,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I usually play this immediately as it cuts out the trick ...Nxe4 Nxe4 ...d5 forking B and N.  It also gets the B off the semi-open c-file and covers the queenside pawns in the event of queenside castling though I usually castle kingside in this opening.
512,12,6,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The standard move to prepare kingside castling.  Another approach is to develop the queenside to allow queenside castling or at least to disturb White's troop of minor pieces there with 7....b5 followed by queenside fianchetto though Black has to keep an eye on potential White tricks on e6 or 7...Nbd7 followed by ...Nc5 forking Bb3 and pawn on e4
513,12,7,f4,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq f3',I've found this to be a more aggressive and flexible move than immediate castling.  My worries in this line usually concern my e-pawn when Black puts his B on b7.
514,12,8,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Quite unusual in my experience and less daunting than 8...b5 as explained previously.
515,12,9,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I didn't want to swap the Ns yet as the Nd4 provides me with so many possible plans.  In a previous annotation I explained why I swapped on c6 at the first opportunity in terms of establishing an isolated pawn for Black.  It was pointed out to me that Black's mass of central pawns and half-open b-file more than compensated.  This B move develops it centrally and defends the Nd4 so that the Q can also develop freely.
516,12,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Standard.
517,12,11,1Qf3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',I immediately prepare to attack the castled king keeping my options open about where to put my king.
518,12,12,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p3/3NPP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',With the N deprived of its most natural retreat square Black attacks it.
519,12,13,1Nxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1Np1n2/4p3/4PP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Now I swapped removing a defender of e5.  I didn't want to retreat the N and I rejected 11. Nf5 as I didn't like 11...Bxf5 12. exf5 d5 when I wasn't sure how to respond.
520,12,14,1f5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',I played this quickly without really thinking.  I was keen to prosecute the kingside attack so it made sense to shut off Black's QB but I think I should have planned a bit more carefully around here.  If Black counter-attacked in the centre the pawn could become weak and my king exposed.
521,12,15,1Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/4bppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Unexpected but it makes sense.  Black wants to swap the DSBs before White's attack gets going.
522,12,16,1O-O-O,b'r1bqnrk1/4bppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',Now seemed a propitious time to castle queenside allowing me to prepare an all-out kingside assault.  The king seems quite safe here as Black's pieces are more suitably arranged for kingside defence than queenside attack.
523,12,17,1Bg5,b'r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pPb1/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',Black pursues his plan to eliminate the DSBs.  My B is of course pinned against my K so I can't avoid the swap but I can influence how it happens.  I didn't want his Q coming to g5 hence my reply.
524,12,18,1h4,b'r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pPb1/4P2P/1BN1BQ2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - h3',"As I let go of the piece I thought ""Oh dear he can just take the pawn"" but then decided that if he did I could happily play Qh3..."
525,12,19,Nf6,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/p1pp1n2/4pP2/4P2P/1BN1Q3/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',Black reactivates the backward N as soon as possible.  The N covers g4 and h5 and inhibits my N and Q by attacking e4.
526,12,20,1Qf3,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/p1pp1n2/4pP2/4P2P/1BN2Q2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - -',and I returned my Q to f3 to support the pawns' advance.
527,12,21,1h5,b'r1bq1rk1/5pp1/p1pp1n2/4pP1p/4P2P/1BN2Q2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - h6',Black again inhibits the planned pawn push.
528,12,22,1Ne2,b'r1bq1rk1/5pp1/p1pp1n2/4pP1p/4P2P/1B3Q2/PPP1N1P1/2KR3R b - -',I had to think quite a long time to devise a plan now eventually deciding on Nc3-e2-g3 to attack the h-pawn which would be difficult to defend safely.  The problem is that this allows Black to counter-attack in the centre.
529,12,23,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/5pp1/p1p2n2/3ppP1p/4P2P/1B3Q2/PPP1N1P1/2KR3R w - -',Black duly takes the opportunity.  A complex and exciting tactical struggle now ensues.

531,12,25,1dxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/5pp1/p1p2n2/4pP1p/4p2P/1B3QN1/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',With White's Q on f3 attacked  Black can afford to allow the pinned pawn to expose his Q to the attack by the Rd1
532,12,26,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1p2n2/4pP1p/4N2P/1B3Q2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',Now Black moves off the open d-file...
533,12,27,2Nd6,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1pN1n2/4pP1p/7P/1B3Q2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - -',Another long think came up with this multi-purpose move.  I wanted to exert pressure on f7 possible swapping B and N for p and R but also to defend f5 and possibly swap on c8 depending on how Black reacted.
534,12,28,2e4,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1pN1n2/5P1p/4p2P/1B3Q2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',Black attacks White's Q and threatens to march the pawn to promotion pronto.
535,12,29,2Qg3,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1pN1n2/5P1p/4p2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - -',With this sidestep I over-defend the Nd6 and threaten to come to g6 at some stage.
536,12,30,2Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1pN4/3n1P1p/4p2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',This cuts off my Rd1's defence of the Nd6 and my B's attack on f7.  It also supports the potential pawn advance allows another piece to occupy f6 and puts the N in range of dangerous squares like b4 c3 d3.
537,12,31,2Rhf1,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/p1pN4/3n1P1p/4p2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/2KR1R2 b - -',Although my pawn on f5 was already defended its defence was a precariously placed attacking piece.  This move also prepared my pawn's possible advance.  It did create the potential of a fork from d3 though which I would have to watch out for.
538,12,32,2Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/p1pN1q2/3n1P1p/4p2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/2KR1R2 w - -',Yes.. the Q occupies f6 defending g7 lining up on b2 and barring the way forward for my pawn.
539,12,33,2Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/p1p2q2/3n1P1p/4N2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/2KR1R2 b - -',I was glad to seize this opportunity as soon as it arose.

541,12,35,2Kb1,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/p1p4q/3n1P1p/4N2P/1B4Q1/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 b - -',I didn't fidn any of the ways of blocking the check very attractive.
542,12,36,2Qe3,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/p1p5/3n1P1p/4N2P/1B2q1Q1/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 w - -',Played swiftly this also took me by surprise.  Clearly Black was keen to swap Queens and then would be able to deliver the fork and gain a material advantage.  A rather panicked deliberation then ensued and I came up with ...
543,12,37,2Nf6+,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/p1p2N2/3n1P1p/7P/1B2q1Q1/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 b - -',with which I felt inordinately proud given that Black couldn't capture with his N because it would leave his Q undefended nor his g7 pawn because it was pinned.  But of course he could just move his King and then I would have two pieces en prise.
544,12,38,2Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/5pp1/p1p2N2/3n1P1p/7P/1B2q1Q1/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 w - -',I realised now that I had let my emotions get the better of me and that I was now in trouble.  How could I avoid the loss of material?
545,12,39,2Rd3,b'r1b2r1k/5pp1/p1p2N2/3n1P1p/7P/1B1Rq1Q1/PPP3P1/1K3R2 b - -',?? Not like this.  We didn't have time to discuss the game afterwards as I had to get home but Stephen did point out that I'd moved the wrong rook up.  26. Rf3 would have prevented the swap and allowed me another move to extricate my N.

552,12,46,3Rae8,b'4rr1k/5p2/b1p2p2/p2n1P1p/3R3P/1B6/PPP3P1/1K2R3 w - -',Black's plan is simple: swap off and accentuate the material advantage until it becomes overwhelming.
553,12,47,3Rde4,b'4rr1k/5p2/b1p2p2/p2n1P1p/4R2P/1B6/PPP3P1/1K2R3 b - -',? I think I should have avoided a swap for as long as possible as 2 rooks at least give one attacking potential if they can be coordinated.  Unfortunately I also had to guard against back-row mates and was somewhat dispirited so didn't look hard enough for another move.  31. Red1 was at least a possibility though I didn't fancy being harried by N and B.

556,12,50,3Ne5,b'3r3k/5p2/b4p2/p1p1nP1p/2P4P/PB2R3/1P4P1/1K6 w - -',Now I wasn't going to be able to prevent the loss of the c-pawn or worse.

668,15,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"I am playing this game with the delightful Zhanna. I am over 1000 grading points above her. I delibrately let her have my queen early on to give her a chance. Unfortunately little by little she lets me get back into the game.
"
669,15,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So we start conventionally.
670,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is good development.
671,15,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I copy her.
672,15,4,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a good developing move too although c2-c4 is more usual.
673,15,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I continue to copy.
674,15,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is not a good move. After the correct reply from black c7-c6 white has to move the bishop again.
675,15,7,Qd7,b'rnb1kb1r/pppq1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So I offer the queen.
676,15,8,Bxd7+,b'rnb1kb1r/pppB1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',She takes it.
677,15,9,Bxd7,b'rn2kb1r/pppb1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I take back.
678,15,10,b3,b'rn2kb1r/pppb1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And she develops.
679,15,11,Bd6,b'rn2k2r/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So do I.
680,15,12,Nbd2,b'rn2k2r/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is not a bad square for the knight.
681,15,13,O-O,b'rn3rk1/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I castle.
682,15,14,c3,b'rn3rk1/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1PP1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This move doesn't fit in well with 6. b3. Better was Bb2.
683,15,15,Bb5,b'rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/1b1p4/3P4/1PP1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I stop her from castling 0-0 as my bishop attacks f8.
684,15,16,a4,b'rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/1b1p4/P2P4/1PP1PN2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ a3',So she hits my bishop.
685,15,17,Ba6,b'rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P4/1PP1PN2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',So I drop back.
686,15,18,1Nh4,b'rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P3N/1PP1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This move doesn't achieve much. I think it would be better to continue with the plan of attacking my Ba6 with b3-b4 with the threat of b4-b5 winning my bishop and if say c7-c6 then Qd1-b3 renewing the threat of b4-b5. If I then play Bd3 she has c3-c4.
687,15,19,1Nbd7,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P3N/1PP1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I continue to develop.
688,15,20,1c4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P1PP3N/1P2P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This is a good move preparing 0-0. Although it eventually loses a pawn it is worthwhile losing a pawn in this position if it also involves improving development and exchanging pieces (which it does). White is so far up she can afford the odd pawn here and there as long as she is careful.
689,15,21,1dxc4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b2bpn2/8/P1pP3N/1P2P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I take.
690,15,22,1bxc4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b2bpn2/8/P1PP3N/4P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',She takes back.
691,15,23,1Bb4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b3pn2/8/PbPP3N/4P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',This move threatens Ba6xc4 as her Nd2 is now pinned.
692,15,24,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b3pn2/8/PbPP3N/4P3/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So she castles while she can.
693,15,25,1Bxd2,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b3pn2/8/P1PP3N/4P3/3b1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I take the knight.
694,15,26,1Bxd2,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b3pn2/8/P1PP3N/4P3/3B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',She takes back.
695,15,27,1Bxc4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/P1bP3N/4P3/3B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I take the pawn attacking her rook.
696,15,28,1Re1,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/P1bP3N/4P3/3B1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',And she moves the attacked rook.
697,15,29,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/P1bPn2N/4P3/3B1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I advance my knight.
698,15,30,1Bb4,b'r4rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/PBbPn2N/4P3/5PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',She moves her attacked bishop although I was in two minds whether or not I would take it anyway.
699,15,31,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/PBbPn2N/4P3/5PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',and I move my attacked rook.
700,15,32,1Qf3,b'r3r1k1/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/PBbPn2N/4PQ2/5PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I don't think this is a very good move. Although it attacks my Ne4 after I protect it with Bd5 I am threatening discovered attacks on her queen by moving my Ne4. Qc2 looked stronger to me.
701,15,33,1Bd5,b'r3r1k1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3b4/PB1Pn2N/4PQ2/5PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So I protect.
702,15,34,1Rac1,b'r3r1k1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3b4/PB1Pn2N/4PQ2/5PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',She develops her rook to a sensible square attacking my pawn on c7.
703,15,35,1c6,b'r3r1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3b4/PB1Pn2N/4PQ2/5PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',I protect it by moving it forward.
704,15,36,1Qf4,b'r3r1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3b4/PB1PnQ1N/4P3/5PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Post Match Computer Analysis (PMCA) says this is a mistake. I was thinking that maybe in some variations I can play g7-g5 attacking both her queen and knight. g7-g5 immediately though can be met with Qc7 attacking my knight so I decide to protect my knight first with my rook.
705,15,37,1Rad8,b'3rr1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3b4/PB1PnQ1N/4P3/5PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',PMCA says that this is also a mistake and gives c5 as a better move for black. I am not convinced.
706,15,38,2f3,b'3rr1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3b4/PB1PnQ1N/4PP2/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',This is a good move attacking my knight.
707,15,39,2Nef6,b'3rr1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3b4/PB1P1Q1N/4PP2/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',So I retreat it.

710,15,42,2Bb4,b'3rr1k1/p2n1ppp/1pp1pn2/3b4/PB1P1Q1N/4PP2/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',The bishop drops back again.
711,15,43,2h6,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pp1pn1p/3b4/PB1P1Q1N/4PP2/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',I am preparing g7-g5 again!
712,15,44,2e4,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pp1pn1p/3b4/PB1PPQ1N/5P2/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',But she responds with this excellent attack.
713,15,45,2Bb3,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pp1pn1p/8/PB1PPQ1N/1b3P2/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',So I attack her a pawn.
714,15,46,2a5,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pp1pn1p/P7/1B1PPQ1N/1b3P2/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',She moves it.

716,15,48,2Rxc6,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pR1pn1p/P7/bB1PPQ1N/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 b - -',This is a dreadful move just throwing away a rook for no reason. PMCA prefers 25. Qg3 although I like Qc2 hitting a2.
717,15,49,2Bxc6,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pb1pn1p/P7/1B1PPQ1N/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',So I take. White is still winning she is one point up and has a lovely strong pawn centre.
718,15,50,2d5,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pb1pn1p/P2P4/1B2PQ1N/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 b - -',White opens up the position. This could have led to a wining attack.
719,15,51,2exd5,b'3rr1k1/p2n1pp1/1pb2n1p/P2p4/1B2PQ1N/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',So I take.

721,15,53,2Nh7,b'3rr1k1/p2n1ppn/1pb4p/P2pP3/1B3Q1N/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',So I retreat.
722,15,54,2Nf5,b'3rr1k1/p2n1ppn/1pb4p/P2pPN2/1B3Q2/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 b - -',Her knight moves into a dangerous attacking position threatening Ne7 check which also attacks the Bc6.
723,15,55,2Nc5,b'3rr1k1/p4ppn/1pb4p/P1npPN2/1B3Q2/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',So I block the bishop's diagonal so that Ne2 check can just be met with Re8xe7.
724,15,56,2Nxh6+,b'3rr1k1/p4ppn/1pb4N/P1npP3/1B3Q2/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 b - -',"This mistake throws away white's advantage. 29. Qg4 Ng5 30. f4 Nge6 31. Nxh6+ Kf8 32. Nf5 Kg8 33. Ra1 Bd7 34. Nd6 bxa5 35. Nxe8 axb4 36. Nf6+ Kf8 37. Nxd5 is a winning line for white according to PMCA.

725,15,57,2gxh6,b'3rr1k1/p4p1n/1pb4p/P1npP3/1B3Q2/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',So I take back. PMCA says it is level now.
726,15,58,3Qg4+,b'3rr1k1/p4p1n/1pb4p/P1npP3/1B4Q1/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 b - -',She throws in a check.

731,15,63,3d4,b'3rr2k/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P7/3p2Q1/2B2P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',I defend the check by attacking his bishop.
732,15,64,3Re5,b'3rr2k/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P3R3/3p2Q1/2B2P2/6PP/6K1 b - -',This is a mistake too. Simply retreating the bishop to b2 was best.
733,15,65,3dxc3,b'3rr2k/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P3R3/6Q1/2p2P2/6PP/6K1 w - -',So I take the bishop.

737,15,69,3Rg8,b'6rk/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P3R3/6Q1/2p2PK1/3r2PP/8 w - -',Now she is losing her queen.
738,15,70,3Qxg8+,b'6Qk/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P3R3/8/2p2PK1/3r2PP/8 b - -',So she takes my rook
739,15,71,3Kxg8,b'6k1/p4p1n/1pb1n2p/P3R3/8/2p2PK1/3r2PP/8 w - -',I take back.

942,23,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I usually replied c5 a Sicilian opening. But many times I tried as well the Caro Kann Defense in a regular tournament. Its a tough opening for black favoured by many defensive players.

945,23,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White can try as well the advance variation 3. e5 or 3. exd5 cxd5 4.c4 the Caro-Kann/Panov Attack with a good development for white 2 bishops despite of having an isolated pawn

949,23,8,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The position is almost equal. My first thought white's move is 6. Nf3 or Bc4. The c3 move purposes are to defend his d4 pawn then move his bishop in d3 and queen in c2 towards the  black h7 pawn and  as well to discourage black bishop in b4 square.
950,23,9,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I immediately put my king's bishop before white's occupying the f4 square by his bishop.

For all beginners working through chess games if there is an open rook file never ever ever put your queen in front of your king because the opponent will get you every time.
1089,27,16,Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/p1pp1ppp/1p1b4/4q3/4R3/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ3K w kq -',Although not a bad response this move allows me to do some more bad things.

In retrospect I think black made the right choice.  If 14. ... Rb8 15. Bxd6.  If black retakes 15. ... cxd6 then 16. Qxc6 leaves black in an ugly ugly place.
1092,27,19,1Nc3,b'B1b2rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/5b2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2Q3K b - -',An important point in all development is to ensure your rooks can get into the game.  I needed to get that knight out to free up the rook.

1094,27,21,1Ba6,b'4r1k1/p1pp1ppp/bp6/8/5b2/2N2B2/PPP3PP/R2Q3K w - -',The thought process of getting your bishop into the game is sound but not at the expense of going down more material.  Much better to play Be5 and start some pawn pushing on the queenside.
1095,27,22,1Nd5,b'5rk1/p1pQ1ppp/bp6/3N4/5b2/5B2/PPP3PP/R6K b - -',I have eyes on his king wanting to see if I can make something happen based upon black's responses.  This move also threatened his bishop.  An important point for all players.  Once someone is ahead the presumption of many early players is that it's to your advantage to trade as the fewer pieces your opponent has the harder it is to mount a comeback.  However the fewer pieces you have the harder it is to checkmate.  If you have an overwhelming material advantage yes trade away on even terms.  If you're only up by a knight if you trade even the rest of the game it's a draw as a king + knight can't checkmate squat.
1096,27,23,f6,b'5rk1/p1p3pp/bp3p2/3N2b1/6Q1/5B2/PPP3PP/R6K w - -',This move was a big mistake.  I have two pieces that can threaten on white squares.  If you must defend a bishop like this use the h pawn instead.  Far safer.  
1097,27,24,2Qe6+,b'5rk1/p1p3pp/bp2Qp2/3N2b1/8/5B2/PPP3PP/R6K b - -',Now that Black's bishop is tied up and unable to come to the rescue I wanted to see if I could induce a bad move.  If Black makes the right move I'll just use my knight to scarf c7 and threaten some new mate action.
1098,27,25,2Rf7,b'6k1/p1p2rpp/bp2Qp2/3N2b1/8/5B2/PPP3PP/R6K w - -',Better to go to the corner.  For new players an important point is that playing fast doesn't do you any good.  Although it is highly unlikely Black will come back in this game it's important to work through the moves.  Kh8 is the only move you can make here that doesn't give up a mate.
1099,27,26,2Qxf8#,b'5Q1k/p1p1N1pp/bp3p2/6b1/8/5B2/PPP3PP/R6K b - -',All in all an interesting game with a great start but an early blunder cost him the game.  If you find yourself mistake prone then odds are if you just slow down and analyze a little better you'll make better moves.  I think that with a little patience and some games under his belt c1pe will be a 1500 player in no time.

Nevertheless hope springs eternal and the 1st team was short of players so I filled in.  Things didn't start well for me as I turned up at their old venue and as 7:30pm drew near realised that there were no chess players present or boards being set up so I asked at the bar and was directed to the new venue on the other side of town arriving about 8 mins late.  Fortunately the match had not yet started.

He prefers 3....c5 or 3....g5 or 3....c6 citing one of his own games as an example of 3....g5 which he drew against Illescas in 1985.  It leads to some bizarre-looking pawn formations."
1308,33,5,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This is not mentioned by Gallagher so it's either a modern innovation or not very good.  It seems to me to be a natural developing move that doesn't create any weaknesses in White's position or provoke any particular response from Black.
1309,33,6,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',After quite a long think I decided on this conservative approach hoping to exploit the absence of White's DSB from the queenside.  I was already worrying about how to develop my kingside given that the e-pawn was pinned against my Q and that both ...f6 and ...g5 looked ugly to me.  So I planned to get the Q away from the pin then play ...e6 followed by developing my DSB and castling kingside.  Given the passivity of my resulting game I think in retrospect that 4....g5 would have been the better option.
1310,33,7,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White challenges Black's central N with his own N rather than pushing at it with 5. f3.

Moreover if I did develop with 7...e6 and 8...Be7 White could capture on e7 forcing my K to recapture and I wouldn't be able to castle anyway; so I delayed those moves by developing this B outside the intended pawn fortress leaving for later the decision on how I would develop the kingside.

No bishop retreats looked attractive and 8....Be4 just seemed to encourage White to play 9. f3 building a strong centre with tempo.  I didn't really consider 8...Bg4 for the same reason so ....

Bxe7 but I was still determined to castle and with d8 covered by White's DSB queenside castling was out of the question.  So my DSB went to the only available square that wasn't covered by a White pawn or piece.

Capturing with the N which seemed the more natural move would have resulted in the Bd6 then having to move after White had recaptured on e5 so in the interests of speed I gave up B for N.

While waiting for this move I was busily considering whether White could actually afford to sac his Q rather than play this move: eg 19. exf6 Nxg6 20. f7+ Kg8 21. fxe8=Q+ Qxe8 22. Raf1 but I couldn't quite see how White could force home such an attack.

But knightrider62 asked me very good question later on when we played what opening should I study.  The answer is the Ruy Lopez because that's not only common and an easy variation but GM's really analyze it and as we know Jack advises me to study openings that are played by Masters and GM's.  Having said all of that 3.Bb5 is slightly more favorable as that's the Ruy Lopez.

But @knightrider62: First there are way for black to prevent you from taking that pawn.  And what's important is to ask what you're opponent can do and not assume well if I play this then that will happen.  Chess is a lot more complicated then that.  This is why my coach says ""Start Thinking"".  By this he means don't assume anything.  Instead analyze and access the position to see what your opponent can do.  Second winning a pawn in that general area will often cause problems for you.  Yes you'd win a pawn but black has ways to attack and sometimes win a piece.  Now according to the analysis this is an inaccuracy because of black's next move but I disagree.  I was making a point but I don't give it as an inaccuracy.  And while it doesn't appear so this really is an inaccuracy because after ...BXN normally I'd respond with Qxf3 but that would be an outright blunder to due d N as it would lose a Q.  So now the only other option is to take back with g pawn which opens the K up very early and makes the K susceptible to exposure.  While there's no weakness yet there's a strong weakness because when it's opened like that things later on can go in there and attack it.  For that very reason I have to agree that best was 9.Bxd4 with the idea that after 9...Bxd4 10.h3 Bxf3 11.Qxf3 c6 12.Reb1 Kh8 13.Ne2 Be5 14.Bb3 Qa5 15.Rf1 Qd2 16.Kh1 Rac8 and white is much safer.  The idea is to really analyze and figure out how and why a certain move loses material.  A lot of times it doesn't appear so but there are things behind which is why the threat is there. "
1438,37,5,1Bb3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2bpp3/3n4/1BNPBP2/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b - -',? The idea is to get a good outpost for the B.  According to the computer analysis this is a mistake because of how black responds.  Normally I would disagree and only call it an inaccuracy because it leaves doubled pawns away from the center which is something that you do not want.  However that's certainly better then doubled around the K or right in the center.  The reason I must agree however with the computer is that white will lose another pawn.  Best move might have lost one pawn but what she played will lose two.  Having said that the best move was as it mentions is 13.Bb5  13...a6 14.Ba4 b5 15.f4 bxa4 16.fxe3 Nd7 17.Nxa4 Ba7 18.c3 Nf5 19.Bxa7 Qg5+ 20.Kh1 Rxa7 21.Qf3 
1439,37,6,1c4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/6q1/2bnp1B1/2P5/1P1P1P2/2PQ1P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',?! I understand exactly why she played this.  Right now white is under a lot of pressure and black's advantages are slowly increasing.  So white is doing anything for counter play.  The computer analysis gives this as a mistake because of black does.  Well I disagree with it but I do give it as an inaccuracy however for the same reason.  In it best was 19.Kh1 with the idea being 19...Qf5 20.Rg1 Qxf3+ 21.Rg2 Rfe8 22.c4 Nf4 23.Bxf4 Qxf4 24.Qxe4 exf4 25.Rbg1 g6 26.h4 Kf8   
1440,37,7,2Qe2,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/6q1/3np1B1/1bP5/1P1P1P2/2P1QP1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',"?? I understand exactly why white played this.  Normally it's a very solid move with the idea being the Q in front of a R in the center.  The idea is to attack the center as that's also how you control it.  And I've seen fine examples from GM's. For example GM Judit Polgar win against Anand right before he became a world champion.  It was in her book ""Victory over Anand.""  This however is a mistake according to the analysis.  But in my mind unlike before it's more then a mistake.  I view as a blunder because it gives away a free piece.  That's right this move leaves that DSB en-prise plus it's going to allow black to win a R for a B.  So black now has a much stronger advantage.  Best was 20.Qc1  20...Nc3 would come after that  21.Kh1 Nxb1 22.Rg1 Nc3 23.Bh6 gxh6 24.Qxh6 Bc5 25.Bxg6+ fxg6 26.Qh3 Bd4 27.Qg3 Kg7 28.c5 Rf7   Although white would still lose a piece the damage would not be as severe as he'd be down 5 points as opposed to 7.  "
1441,37,8,2c5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/8/2P1p2q/5n2/1P1P1P2/2P2P1P/4RQ1K b - -',?? The idea was to get a passed pawn.  I like the intention because passed pawns are generally dangerous and ugly.  However white can and does prevent the that.  Even if he brought one of those R's to c8 the idea would work and that's what I mean when I talk about bringing that R in front of a pawn like that to stop the opponent from getting a passed pawn.  But what white plays is far worse and it is going to lose a Q for a N which is why this move is a blunder.  In fact this is was the plan behind 23...Qh5 which is why it's also important to think and plan ahead.  I'm going by the anlaysis reveals as I agree.  The best move here was 24.Re3 to prevent.  And this time I do not completely agree with what the anlaysis said because the line they gave also loses a Q.  There would've been ways to protect it had white played that.  
1442,37,9,2Rxe5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/8/2P1R3/8/1P1P3q/2P2P1P/6K1 b - -',?? I also understand what happened here.  Since black has a winning advantage white's going to do what she can to compensate.  However while black had a winning advantage this move loses immediately for white.  Now with best from knightrider black has a mate in 7.  27...Rae8 28.Re3 Rxe3 29.fxe3 Qxe3+ 30.Kg2 Qf4 31.c6 Re8 32.Kh3 Re2 33.cxb7 Rxh2#  Instead best would've been 27.Re3 as now 27...Qg4+ 28.Kf1 Rac8 29.c4 Qd1+ 30.Kg2 Qxb3 31.Kg3 Rfd8 32.d4 Qxc4 33.dxe5 Rxc5 34.Kf3 Qf1 and while black has an overwhelming advantage there are still no immediate mate threats with this. 
1443,37,10,2Rd5,b'4rrk1/pp3ppp/8/2PR4/8/1P1P3q/2P2P1P/6K1 b - -',?? A blunder which will lead to an immediate.  Sure it was still mate but it would've been in 7 moves had white played 28.Re3 because white's R prevents R from delivering right on the back rank.  But with this move black has an immediate mate in one which he does take advantage of.
1444,37,11,2Re1#,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/8/2PR4/8/1P1P3q/2P2P1P/4r1K1 w - -',Overall this was a very enjoyable game.  And white played extremely well where.  But the main moral is always plan ahead and ask what your opponent is planning to do.  Does a certain move lose material result in mate.  If the answer is yes then it is better not to play that move.  That's the reason that why is the most common question.  It's because you don't know if a move is good or not unless you know what makes it so.  This is also why it's important to be a spectator of your own game as easy19 puts it and look at everything not just one or two moves.  @knightrider62: You have gotten better as after this game we played each other and I was very impressed at your performance.  If you can remember this lesson you're play will improve tremendously.
