Ok should black try to avoid drawn by playing Kd8? This is the interesting part. White must take the rook in f7 and then it's black turn to go: Qe4  Kf2 (forced otherwise I lose a rook or more) Bd4  (if Qxc2  it leads more or less to the same but with less danger for white - I think). White can release the danger with RxB but it is not necessary believe me: Kg3 Qe3  Kh4! (it seems bad but it is the good one. If Kg4 Qe2  Kf4 - forced - and via c2 the black queen goes to c8 and it leads to mate. Try if you don't believe me) 
Kh4 ok then the only way for black to go on is Qf2  Kh5. Now black can try to defend or go on with the checks. Anyway the material is equal and white reached his objective to be back in the game. 
Let's go a little further it is fun: black goes Qe2 . Again Kg6 is forced otherwise is checkmate. Qxc2  and white goes f5! Now black has to care for the bishop AND for the checks that can give the white queen... drawn is assured for white (for example: Be5 Qf8  and the black king cannot escape to the c column because of the white rook in c1. If Qb2 instead of moving the bishop Rh-c1 is even more dangerous for black. If Ra7 instead Qg8  Kd7 Qe6  Kd8 and Qxd6  is really bad for black...)

Must WHITE try to take advantage before all this? No. Observe that after 27. ... Ke7 Qb7  wins a rook but loses the game. 

So apparently black must either stay with drawn or face the loss of the f7 rook and get into a check labyrinth without being sure to get out of it...

When [2.h3] was played it weakened the pawn structure kingside and it leaves g2 open to some pressure which will be applied by the bishop at b7. The pawn structure may suggest kingside castling for white and the fianchettoed bishop plays well into this concept. Also the squares e4 and d5 will be further influenced by the bishop.

In the first game as white I squandered an excellent position accidentally got caught in a fork and still would have salvaged a draw if I'd been just a tad more precise with my king.  Anyway I wanted revenge!  So here's the second game.

Good e4.  I'm most familiar with these systems."
418,18,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I usually play the Sicilian or the King's Pawn game as a response to e4 but I figured my opponent is likely very familiar with those.  So I decided to play the center-counter (Scandinavian) defense as a kind of psychological juke to get him out of a comfort zone.
419,18,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',?! Definitely not what I expected-- White's usual response is 2. exd5 which Black replies with either Qxd5 or Nf6 (the Marshall Gambit which I prefer).  Maybe Black was also trying for a psychological ploy?

As White I <i>hate</i> playing against the French and I would never consciously choose to play it as Black but the position of the bishop definitely has potential...
422,18,5,Ne2,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BppPb2/3P4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! White's line of thought is pretty easy to follow here I'm sure he intended to follow up with Ng3 attacking the bishop which I can simply retreat to g6.  Nf3 would probably have been better in the long run.

I would use the pawn chain on the light squares coupled with my light-squared bishop to control the middle of the board and eventually either force open files or perhaps create a passed pawn on the queenside.

Looking at the rating differential you would think it should be a piece of cake for me.  I was aware of my opponent's optimum rating however - 1330.  Looking back through his profile he has an impressive array of wins over 1400  opposition and even a 1500  player.  In those games he either delivered checkmate or his opponents resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  His playing strength is therefore very similar to The Dentist - remember him anyone?  Well I did manage to beat NN in 18 moves - Glenda struck again but there was a stage in the game where I took 2 days to come back with a move for the want of a plan.  I hope you have a good read as this is all about an unusual opening.

780,34,6,Be7,b'r3k2r/p2nbppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/1NP1P3/RP3PPP/4KBNR w Kkq -',Let's face it both sides have developed pretty oddly. White's idea of a good opening is to fiddle aroud with his queen and waste a move with his rook while Black's pawn formation looks rather weak.
781,34,7,Nb8,b'rn2k2r/p3bppp/R1p1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/1NP1P3/1P3PPP/4KBNR w Kkq -',The thing is that White could have got his rook here without that initial rook move. And now Black's knight goes back to its original square. If anyone knows a good book on opening principles I will recommend it to both players.
782,34,8,1Ra1,b'rn2k2r/p3bppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/1NP1P3/1P3PPP/R3KBNR b Kkq -',And back again. After THREE moves the rook is back where it started.
783,34,9,Rxb2+,b'4k2r/p3bppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/3P4/2P1P3/1r1K1PPP/R4BNR w k -',By now the board has rather cleared up and Black has gained a foothold in White's undeveloped position.
784,34,10,1exd4,b'4k2r/R3bppp/4p3/3p1b2/3P4/2P5/1r3PPP/4KBNR b k -',The opening goes straight into an endgame!

789,34,15,2Ra8a6,b'5rk1/5ppp/R2bp3/3p4/3P2P1/5P2/2r1NK2/R7 b - -',...but White has other attacks in mind.

792,34,18,Bxf4,b'5rk1/5ppp/R7/N2pP3/5bP1/3K4/6r1/R7 w - -',Perhaps Black should bring his other rook and king into the action. Otherwise White sort of has a material advantage.
793,34,19,Kh8,b'5r1k/4N1p1/R4p1p/3KP1b1/6r1/8/8/5R2 w - -',Black's king retreats instead of coming out. Perhaps he would otherwise have won...

795,34,21,4e6,b'5k2/6p1/R3Pp1p/3K2b1/6r1/8/8/5R2 b - -',Now Black is decidedly behind - he is an exchange down and is threatened by a passed pawn.
796,34,22,f5,b'4k3/6p1/R3P2p/3K1pb1/6r1/8/8/4R3 w - -',But Black has several passed pawns of his own.

799,34,25,f3,b'3rk3/1RK1b1p1/R3P2p/8/8/5p2/8/8 w - -',Well it WAS uncertain. Now Black's pawns look likely to succeed in their advance...
800,34,26,f2,b'1R1rk3/2K1b1p1/R3P2p/8/8/8/5p2/8 w - -',The Charge of the Light Brigade! That pawn is not going to stop!

806,34,32,Kh3,b'4r3/5R2/8/8/8/5Rbk/8/5K2 w - -',Black is after 82...Re1  
807,34,33,Kh3,b'8/5R2/8/8/8/5Rbk/4r3/6K1 w - -',White's king would be trapped without the assistance of his two rooks.
808,34,34,8Rgf7,b'8/5R2/8/8/8/6bk/4r3/5RK1 b - -',Notice how the game is being compressed around one quarter of the board.
809,34,35,8Rg2+,b'8/5R2/8/8/8/6bk/6r1/5RK1 w - -',And now the game is drawn. Thanks to White's rook on f1 blocking White's king in Black now has a perpetual check.
810,35,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Once again I'm playing one of my favorite first moves for white. I would say that I most likely play d4 most of the time. To be honest I really wish this game was rated. Right about now I could use some rating points.
811,35,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',One of the most usual and normal moves I usually see all the time. I'm usually picky about my second move because I usually like to avoid certain openings that I haven't seen in a while. 
812,35,2,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In some way it started to look like a Colle system which I always look forward playing all the time. When I saw ....b6 played by my opponent the only opening I could think of was the Queens Indian Defence. I like playing against that opening every now and then but I have my off days.
813,35,3,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Looking for play along the a8-h1 diagonal which is very common when playing b6. At this point I was going to go face the Queens Indian for sure. 
814,35,4,Bd6,b'rn1qk2r/pb3ppp/1p1bpn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',At this point of the game I very happy where this game was going. We are now playing into a style that I'm used to seeing all time. So I started to relax and play normal with no stress.
815,35,5,e4,b'rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p1bpn2/2pp4/3PP3/2PB1N2/PP1NQPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This is where the game starts to get interesting to me. So far so good. No mistakes are made just yet.
816,35,6,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/p2n1ppp/1p1bp3/2p3B1/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I wanted to get the last piece develop and also make the first attack in the game. f6 would be bad obviously because black would lose a pawn with 14. Qxe6  and I may even take the bishop as well. Not sure it that would be good but it's just a thought
817,35,7,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/p1qn1ppp/1p1bp3/2p3B1/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Putting some pressure online the b8-h1 diagonal.
818,35,8,1Rfd1,b'r4rk1/p1qn1ppp/1p1bp3/2p3B1/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',There's always a big difference as to which rook you move first. I really didn't like this rook to be moved because I thought it would be hard for me to get the other rook into play. I could be wrong but at the time I wish the other rook was moved instead.
819,35,9,1Qd3,b'4rrk1/p1qn1ppp/1p1bp3/2p3B1/3P4/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',I didn't like that rook on the e-file so I moved my Queen to d3 to put some pressure along the d-file and also attack the Knight rather than the bishop because I know that would be the first piece my opponent would have to move first. Obviously my opponent saw that coming so he moved it out the way.
820,35,10,1Bg3,b'1n2rrk1/p1q3pp/1p1bpp2/2p5/3P4/2PQ1NB1/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',I really wanted to trade off his good bishop at this point. I started to hate that bishop a lot because something about attacking along the diagonal wasn't making me feel comfortable at all.
821,35,11,Red8,b'1n1r1rk1/p1q3pp/1p2pp2/2p5/3P4/2PQ1NP1/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Oh man here comes the fun now
822,35,12,Qxc5,b'1n3rk1/p5pp/1p2pp2/2qr4/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',I really started to think at this moment. I was trying to decide whether I wanted to take the Queens off the board or play a little bit longer with them on and see what happens. So I decided to keep the Queens in the game and I'm glad I did which you would see later on.
823,35,13,2Rxd1,b'1n3rk1/p5pp/1p2pp2/2q5/4Q3/2P2NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',White is looking really good at this point. White rook have the open d-file for attack mode and looking forward to putting it along the seventh rank later on. Black is okay but attacking chances are rather slow at this moment.
824,35,14,2Qd3,b'1n3rk1/p5pp/1pq1pp2/8/8/2PQ1NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',I wasn't ready to trade queens at this moment. I'm really happy with my position right now.
825,35,15,2e5,b'1n3rk1/p5pp/1pq2p2/4p3/8/2PQ1NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',double attack coming up as we could see but of course I'm not going to let that go down. 
826,35,16,g6,b'1n3rk1/p6p/1pq2pp1/4pQ2/8/2P2NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',I put my queen there on purpose just to see if he would attack me. I was also looking at 24. Qa4 instead of g6 but then black wouldn't have control of the square I was planning on putting my queen at which is e6.
827,35,17,2Qd3,b'5rk1/p6p/npq2pp1/4p3/8/2PQ1NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',"I ""REALLY"" didn't like this move after I realize a few things about this position. Although my opponent knew I was attacking his knight he missed a rather good move where actually the game could've turn tables and be in his favor. I was looking at 26....e4 27. Qxa6 exf3 (if 28. Qxa7 then fxg2 and black could easily take control at this point of the game and probably even push those pawns down) 28 gxf3 Qxf3 and black is by far in a good position then white at this point. in fact we might say that he's clearly winning in some way."
828,35,18,2Nc5,b'5rk1/p6p/1pq2pp1/2n1p3/8/2PQ1NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',Black had his last chance on playing e4 instead he played Nc5 in which you would see why this was a bad move.
829,35,19,Kg7,b'5r2/p5kp/1pq2pp1/2n1p3/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',Out of all moves this was the very last move I thought that would be played. Qe6 is what I had in mind. 27....Rf7 would've been bad because of 28. b4.
830,35,20,Qxc5,b'2r5/p5kp/1p3pp1/2q1p3/2Q5/2P2NP1/P4PP1/3R2K1 w - -',At this point of the game I saw checkmate in so many ways. Now you see why I didn't feel like trading queens. At this point I hope you especially my oppontent enjoyed my comments about this game. From here on out I'm going to let you play through the rest of the game. Please feel free to make any comments on anything that was good bad or whatever comes to mind.

874,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Another short game taken from a Chelyabinsk Variation tournament
875,38,1,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',This is the tournament starting position
876,38,2,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This seems a good outpost for the knight as it threatens to cause problems on d6 or c7
877,38,3,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N1Np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now he can either lose a rook to a fork or exchange knights and then be forced to move his remaining knight
878,38,4,Ne7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',pressuing the d pawn but notice that his king is now almost completely surrounded
879,38,5,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq c3',reinforces the d pawn but more importantly opens the diagonal to a4 for my queen. I'm not sure if c3 would be better as that leaves my lsb with a better run should it be needed
880,38,6,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Although this attempts to move the knight I think it should have been done earlier (before I moved my c pawn). 
881,38,7,1Qa4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/Q1P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Should he take the knight he will clearly lose the rook however this could save the game for black. If he cannot open some space around the king I have Nd6
882,38,8,1Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p2n1/1N1Pp3/Q1P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Possibly the best move in the circumstances. I looked at this position for a while and wasn't clear if Nc7 or Nxd6 is the better move.
883,38,9,1Nc7+,b'r1bqkb1r/1pN2ppp/p2p2n1/3Pp3/Q1P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',"This at least would gain me a rook.

Black resigned. Interestingly we are still within the Gameknot Database here."

885,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Normal response
886,39,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So far everything standard
887,39,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I have a plan and this is when it came about.  Potential checkmate soon.
888,39,4,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Gearing up towards it.  If it doesn't work atleast i have development
889,39,5,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now its all over.  
890,39,6,Nxe5,b'r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Setting the trap.  If he captures with his knight then I have a problem because his bishop is protected.  Leave a tempting sacrifice.  Will he accept?
891,39,7,Bxd1,b'r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq -',Game over.
892,39,8,Nd5#,b'r2q1bnr/pppnkBpp/3p4/3NN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQ -',Pretty. :-)
