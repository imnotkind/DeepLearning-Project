1,0,1,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnbppp/4p3/2p5/2BPP3/2P2N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',More promising is 10... PxP 11 PxP N-B3 to be followed with ...P-QN3 and ...B-N2.

3,0,3,1Ne1,b'r1b2rk1/2qnbppp/pp6/2pPp3/P1B1P3/2P5/4QPPP/R1BRN1K1 b - -',A very important move which prevents the Black Knight from blockading the passed pawn.

7,0,7,2Nxd6,b'rrb3k1/2q2ppp/pp1N2n1/2pPp3/P3P3/2PBB1P1/4QP1P/R2R2K1 b - -',White doesn't miss his chance this time.
8,0,8,2Qf2,b'rrb3k1/5pp1/pp1q2n1/2pPp2p/P3P3/2PBBPP1/5Q1P/R2R2K1 b - -',This move prepares P-KB4 and forces the blocking of the Q side.

15,0,15,Rd7,b'6k1/3r1pp1/1p6/p1pPrP1p/P3P2q/2P2Q1P/4R2K/6R1 w - -',Better is 40... K-B1 41 P-B4 where the win is more difficult for White.
16,0,16,4Re2,b'6k1/3r2p1/1p3p2/p1pPrP1p/P3P2q/2P2Q1P/4R2K/6R1 b - -',By this Rook maneuver White has shut off the Black Q which can now be exchanged.
17,0,17,Kd8,b'3k4/1r4p1/1p3p2/p1pPrP1p/P1P1PK2/7P/4R3/1R6 w - -',White now sacrifices the protected passed pawn in return for winning the pawn on QN6 enabling his Rooks to invade Black's position.
18,0,18,5Rd5,b'4k3/2r3p1/1R3p2/p1pRrP1p/P1P1PK2/7P/8/8 b - -',Black resigns as after 54... R/4-K2 55 R-N8 ch K-B2 56 R/5-Q8 Black cannot avoid decisive material loss.
19,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',With recent real life events causing me to take a pretty long break from this site I've decided to come back for another crack at it; I'll try not to take on too much though in case I end up going through another 'chess rut' so to speak! Still a chess game is a chess game and I'm just starting to fall in love with it again ;) this is my first completed game since returning and it worked out very well for me...
20,1,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard Sicilian; nothing new here
21,1,2,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',The Pelikan (Lasker/Sveshnikov) variation something I'm fairly unfamiliar with. I'm more used to either 5...a6 or 5...g6 in this position
22,1,3,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Keeping the knight active and eyeing the d6 square. Mainline according to the Gameknot analyzer done after the game would be d6 preventing the knight from landing on that square. However it certainly didn't like Black's next move...
23,1,4,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! White's happy to move his knight!
24,1,5,Bxd6,b'r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p1nb1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Practically forced to prevent loss of castling rights
25,1,6,Qxd6,b'r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p1nQ1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',It remains nevertheless impossible for now for Black to castle; the White queen is in an excellent position
26,1,7,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/1p1pqppp/p1nQ1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Logical enough; the queen is forced to act as no piece can defend it. If she were to retreat I could see no decent square for her in d3 d2 or d1 (which would in addition block bishops or delay the connecting of rooks) so that only left the exchange
27,1,8,Kxe7,b'r1b4r/1p1pkppp/p1n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Strange to me at the time but then again the black king isn't in that much danger with the queens exchanged off; in addition thanks to White's e4 pawn the e7 square is a horrid square for a knight!
28,1,9,1Bg5,b'r1b4r/1p1pkppp/p1n2n2/4p1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The pin was just irresistible really especially with Nd5 on the cards! Even if the king retreats at this point I can still create doubled pawns and make it a very tasty target after Nd5 which is an outpost thanks to the lack of c-pawn from Black.
29,1,10,1Nb4,b'r1b4r/1p1pkppp/p4n2/4p1B1/1n2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Aggressive though the threat of the fork can be fixed with further development. It also provides protection to the d5 square.
30,1,11,b5,b'r1b4r/3pkppp/p4n2/1p2p1B1/1n2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - b6',Black's position is already pretty desperate so wanting to launch a quick attack on White is understandable but the problem is White's own threats are more immediate! Instead 11...h6 12.Bxf6+ Kxf6 prevents the following assault from White though he still gets to claim b6 with his knight after Nd5+
31,1,12,1a3,b'r1b4r/3pkppp/p4n2/1p2p1B1/1n2P3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',The only defender of d5 is simple to displace!
32,1,13,Kf8,b'r1b2k1r/3p1ppp/p1n2n2/1p1Np1B1/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',"Forced; Ke6 or Ke8 loses out to Nc7+ winning the a8 rook whilst material is also lost with 13...Kd8 14.Nxf6 gxf6 15.Bxf6+ 

Kc6 loses a piece thanks to the discovered attack from the rook (Nxf6+)"
33,1,14,1Rd6,b'r1b2kr1/3p1p1p/p1nR1B2/1p2p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/2K2B1R b - -',After the exchange and the gain of a pawn White chooses to cramp Black's position rather than win another pawn with Rd5 though I will admit I only saw the former at the time as it was both an excellent square for the rook (which couldn't be targeted) and restricted the light-square bishop. Right now Black's a8 rook is doing nothing whilst the other has no target. In addition the two minor pieces left can't move without further material being lost!
34,1,15,1Rg6,b'r1b2k2/3p1p1p/p1nR1Br1/1p2p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/2K2B1R w - -',Pinning the bishop though I've no desire to move it any time soon!
35,1,16,1g3,b'r1b2k2/3p1p1p/p1nR1Br1/1p2p3/4P3/P5P1/1PP2P1P/2K2B1R b - -',The best way to free the bishop and get it into the action; its target is the d7 pawn
36,1,17,1Ra7,b'2b2k2/r2p1p1p/p1nR1Br1/1p2p3/4P3/P5P1/1PP2P1P/2K2B1R w - -',Protecting d7 in preparation for the bishop attack but analysing the position I found it to be so much more dangerous than first appeared!
37,1,18,1Bh3,b'2b2k2/r2p1p1p/p1nR1Br1/1p2p3/4P3/P5PB/1PP2P1P/2K4R b - -',Black resigned at this point but with good reason; the threat of 19.Bf5! was unavoidable (18...Nd4 is still bad after Bxe5) and Black would have to lose the exchange; for example Rg8 leaves it with no safe squares after Bxh7 and 18...Rh6 19.Be7+ Kg7 20.Bf8+ also won the exchange. I hope you enjoyed the annotation and the game - Will probably do more if more interesting games show up! 
38,2,0,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I am employing a defense known as the Benoni. This is a gem I used to pull out often when I started. Black's goals are to direct attacks in the direction of his pawns and uses the initiative to counter white's centre. To those higher ups who keep telling me Benoni lines are inferior I say show me definitive evidence of this!!!
39,2,1,dxe6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4Pn2/2p5/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Alternative: 4. Nc3 exd5 5. Nxd5 Nc6 6. e4 Bd6
40,2,2,fxe6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/4pn2/2p5/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',!? - Interesting that White allows me to keep pressure on d4 and d5 at the cost of weakening my kingside. 
41,2,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2pp4/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq d6',More pawn moves don't look that impressive but I am capturing more and more of the board with every move.
42,2,4,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2pp4/8/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Defends d4 and activates the lsb. Alternative: 6. Bg5?! Be7 7. e3 Nc6 (Black can also castle here) 8. Bb5 0-0 9. 0-0 ... 
43,2,5,Bxd7+,b'rn1qk2r/pp1Bb1pp/4pn2/2pp4/8/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! - Perhaps Be2 would've been better here. Think the exchange favors Black long term as this bishop seems very strong. Though it does weaken my e6 pawn so that's probably what white was thinking.
44,2,6,O-O,b'rn2k2r/pp1qb1pp/4pn2/2pp4/8/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Was expecting Ne5 here but at least the king is protected. Alternative: 9. Ne5 Qd6 10. f4 Nc6 11. Nb5 Qb8?! 12. Nxc6 bxc6
45,2,7,e4,b'r3k2r/pp1qb1pp/2n2n2/2pp4/4p3/PPN1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Adding more and more space while capturing more of the center.
46,2,8,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1qb1pp/2n2n2/2pp4/4p3/PPN1P3/2PN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Forcing white to play reactionary chess instead of making his own plans. Black has a significant development lead and the rooks are connected. White is suffering from a cramped position but has a rigid structure making counterplay on the queenside almost impossible. This makes Black plan to attack the kingside and create weaknesses there.
47,2,9,1Ne2,b'3r1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n2n2/2pp1q2/4p3/PP2P2P/1BPNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Coming to the aid of his King...
48,2,10,1Nh5,b'3r1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pp1q1n/4p3/PP2P2P/1BPNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Forcing white to think before coming to his aid. Notice how g4? weakens the kingside pawn structure significantly for very little gain.
49,2,11,Qg5,b'3r1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pp2q1/4p3/PP2P1PP/1BPN2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',! - The long-term plan of weakening the kingside is looking good. Attacking the weak squares of g3 and e3 as well as attacking Rf1.
50,2,12,1Qe1,b'3r1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pp2q1/4p3/PP2P1PP/1BPN2P1/R3QRK1 b - -',!? - Defends both pawns. Probably white's best option here.
51,2,13,Bc7,b'3r1rk1/ppb3pp/2n5/2pp2q1/4p1P1/PP2P2P/1BPN2P1/R3QRK1 w - -',?! - Looking back I probably should have exchanged rooks at this point and kept the pressure on white.
52,2,14,Rfe8,b'3rr1k1/ppb3pp/2n5/2pp2q1/4p1P1/PP2P2P/1BPNQ1P1/R4RK1 w - -',? - Alternative: 20. ... Qe7 21. Rxf8+ Qxf8 22. Rd1 Qd6 --This move offers counterplay options along the f-file for white.
53,2,15,Qd6,b'3rr1k1/ppb3pp/2nq4/2pp1R2/4p1P1/PP2P2P/1BPNQ1P1/5RK1 w - -',! - A response that forces white to react and play defense once again.
54,2,16,2Rxe7,b'3r2k1/p1b1R1pp/1pn1q3/2pp4/4p1P1/PP2P2P/1BPNQ1P1/5RK1 b - -',? - Perhaps stronger for white would've been retreating to f5.
55,2,17,2g5,b'3r2k1/p1b3pp/1pnq4/2pp1RP1/4p3/PP2P2P/1BPNQ1P1/6K1 b - -',?? - One of the bigger mistakes that white makes. By not carefully looking at the board he overlooks my queen+bishop combo directed at his weak kingside.  Alternative: 28. Nf1!! Qe6 29. Nd2 Re8
56,2,18,3Qb5,b'3r2k1/p5pp/1pn5/1Qpp1RP1/4p3/PP2P1bP/1BPN2Pq/5K2 b - -',?? - Creates a mating net now for white. The correct response for white is Nf3! Sacrificing the knight gives white room to escape allowing play to continue.
57,2,19,3Qh1+,b'3r2k1/p5pp/1pn5/1Qpp1RP1/4p3/PP2P1bP/1BPN2P1/5K1q w - -',A well played game despite being out positioned. A very unusual blunder to miss for White but nonetheless I still believe taufiq is very capable of becoming a very strong player here and over the board.
58,3,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',There was some speculation about what opening I might try given that I've traditionally been a 1.e4 player and haven't played 1.c4 over the board since 1983 but I've been playing this on GK for some time.
59,3,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',White can always play d2-d4 and transpose to a King's Indian but if I wanted to play that I'd play 1.d4.
60,3,2,Nge2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Keeping my options open although I have a reasonable idea of what I'm going to do.
61,3,3,d3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Even now 7.d4 is perfectly reasonable but my opponent is sniffing again and he gives the impression that I'm some old fart who's going to manoeuvre around for 30 moves whilst he tries to hit me down the long diagonal.
62,3,4,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p3B1/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP2NPBP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Apparently I'm supposed to play 0-0 h3 Be3 and work towards d3-d4 all of which begs the question 'Why not play d2-d4 in the first place?'
63,3,5,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p3B1/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP2NPBP/R2QK2R w KQ -',?! Too slow surely.  The Nf6-e8-c7-e6-d4 is seen in some lines but this is simply slow.  8. ... Rb8 ... a6 ... b5 is one way that Black is going to give himself play here or he should be playing 8. ...h6 9.Be3 Kh7 and trying to blockade.  
64,3,6,1Bh6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2np2pB/2p5/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP1QNPBP/R3K2R b KQ -',Nobody said that I had to be subtle.  Now 10. ... Bxh6 11.Qxh6 followed by h2-h4-h5 is a standard Yugoslav style attack from the Sicilian Dragon but without the open c-file to allow Black counter-play.
65,3,7,1Ne6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npn1pB/2p5/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP1QNPBP/R3K2R w KQ -',Still very slow though.  It might be worth playing 10. ... e5 first to clamp down on the centre and try to force ... f5.

67,3,9,1h4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1npn1pB/2p5/2P1P2P/2NP2P1/PP1QNPB1/2KR3R b - h3',English purists are busy getting upset around now but Black's play is just too slow.  White can always throw in e5 opening the h1-a8 diagonal or f2-f4-f5.  Importantly if Black can play b5 so what?  b5-b4 isn't going to help him and bxc4 dxc4 won't achieve much either.  Suddenly White has a free attack.
68,3,10,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1p2ppbp/p1npn1pB/2p5/2P1P2P/2NP2P1/PP1QNPB1/2KR3R w - -',Too slow.  If anything the rook belongs on the f-file looking to play f5 or f6 and coming to f7.

75,3,17,1Bh3,b'r1bqr1kb/1p2p3/p2p2p1/2p5/2PnPBn1/2NP2PB/PP1QN3/2KR3R b - -',What's an exchange between friends?  19. ...Nf2 20.Bxc8 Rxc8 and White can look at sacrificing on h8 or perhaps playing Rh6.  Black might be able to hold for a draw in some lines (White repeating Qg6-h6-g6 etc) but White's pieces are more usefully placed than Black's and the Re8 is badly misplaced.

80,3,22,2Bxd4,b'r2qr1kb/1p6/p2p2p1/2p1p3/2PBP1b1/2NP2P1/PPQ1N3/2KR3R b - -',The knight has to die (Qd2 Nf3=) and I'm minded to give up the rook for Black's dark squared bishop in any event.
81,3,23,2cxd4,b'r2qr1kb/1p6/p2p2p1/4p3/2PpP1b1/2NP2P1/PPQ1N3/2KR3R w - -',There was some debate after the game was to whether Black should play exd4 but if he's to get counter play it must surely come down the b- and c-files and why give me Nf4?
82,3,24,2Nd5,b'r2qr1kb/1p6/p2p2p1/3Np3/2PpP1b1/3P2P1/PPQ1N3/2KR3R b - -',Not so long ago Black's knights appeared to dominate the centre.  Now they're history and the Nd5 looks huge.
83,3,25,2Qd2,b'r2qr1k1/1p4b1/p2p2p1/3Np3/2PpP1b1/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2KR3R b - -',White stops Qg5+ and threatens to come in to h6 in due course.
84,3,26,2b5,b'r2qr1k1/6b1/p2p2p1/1p1Np3/2PpP1b1/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2KR3R w - b6',10 moves or so too late Black attempts to open the Q-side but the problems remain.  He's played ...b5.  So what?
85,3,27,2Rh4,b'r2qr1k1/6b1/p2p2p1/1p1Np3/2PpP1bR/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2KR4 b - -',Doubling with tempo.
86,3,28,Rc8,b'2rqr1k1/6b1/p2pb1p1/1p1Np3/2PpP2R/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2K4R w - -',Black's counter-play is too far behind.  c4 won't fall in time and White isn't interested in heading for an endgame.    Better might be 27. ...Ra7 defending the Bg7.
87,3,29,2Rh4h7,b'2rqr1k1/6bR/p2pb1p1/1p1Np3/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2K4R b - -',With the time control in sight White puts the boot in.  The bishop cannot be defended without losing an exchange (28 ...Qd7 29.Nf6+).  28. ...g5 is potentially the saving move at this stage preventing the queen coming into h6 although I like 29.Nxd4 exd4 30.Qh2 where Black is still exposed. 
88,3,30,2Bxd5,b'2rqr1k1/6bR/p2p2p1/1p1bp3/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2K4R w - -',If White plays 29. exd5 Black has just enough time to defend but a little zwischenzug from White nails it down. 
89,3,31,2Rxg7+,b'2rqr1k1/6R1/p2p2p1/1p1bp3/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP1QN3/2K4R b - -',! Now the attack breaks through.
90,3,32,Kf5,b'2rqr3/7Q/p2p2p1/1p1Ppk2/2Pp4/3P2P1/PP2N3/2K4R w - -',Hoping for 33.Rf1+ Kg4 34.Qxg6+ Qg5+ and Black escapes.
91,3,33,3g4+,b'2rqr3/7Q/p2p2p1/1p1Ppk2/2Pp2P1/3P4/PP2N3/2K4R b - -',"White continues with his mating net.  33. ...Kf6 34. g5+ Kxg5 35.Qh4+ Kf5 36.Nh3# is neat.  
After 34. ...Kf5 35.Qf7+ is probably quickest although Ng3+ might be prettier."
92,3,34,3Qh3+,b'2rqr3/8/p2p2p1/1p1Pp3/2Pp2k1/3P3Q/PP2N3/2K4R b - -',White resigned.  35. ...Kg5 36. Qh4 Kf5 37.Ng3# is the same mate as above.

408,9,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I put pressure on the e5 pawn. I hope to take it here shortly. 
409,9,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',A customary move by white. I take the knight so I can take the pawn. 
410,9,5,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black instead protects his knight which is now protected by the e5 pawn and attacks white's f3 Knight and b5 Bishop which are both protected though. 
411,9,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I continue with my plans to take the pawn. Interesting to see all 4 knights lined up like that. Black's knight is no longer protected but also currently not under attack. 
412,9,7,c6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black attacks white's bishop more with his c pawn. This move is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy and that Qe7 was the best move. Yes indeed for then white would have to move his knight or protect it with the f pawn. Likely this sequence would of occurred: 5. ... Qe7 6. Nf3 Nxf3 7. gxf3 Nxe4 8. Nxe4 Qxe4+ 9. Qe2 Qxe2+ 10. Kxe2. This would of left black with a bit of an advantage in position but as you can see c6 was the move made.  
413,9,8,Qe7,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/4N3/3nP3/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now black plays Qe7. Thus I must protect and retreat my knight. 
414,9,9,Nxf3+,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2NB1n2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I was expecting Nxe4 but it was this move instead.

Very true for this move has a 2-in-1 damage. First the pawn structure for white is thrown off now. It's a 2-in-1 damage because with the pawn structure the way it is now if white castles king-side his king is wide open and vulnerable to attack so this move is definitely a mistake.
416,9,11,Ne2,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/3B1P2/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I retreat the knight but this is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. It says O-O was best? I question that. As I said in the previous comment it would leave the king open for an attack. True it can be defended but in my view it is not the best move right now but that's my view.

Bxe4 Qxe4 would put the material advantage at a tie for both sides so it may help black slightly but this will not be the sequence of events that will take place right off the bat. 
418,9,13,Bg4,b'r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/4P1b1/3B4/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black now attack's white's knight and he's starting to worry white for black is starting to control the game more.

This move gives 0 protection to the e4 pawn thus when black takes it with his queen much more pressure is put on the knight and unless white can find a counter checkmate is imminent...

If white does nothing to protect it Qh1# is inevitable so now castling well castling was still an option but in this position it was not the best idea. It is best to move the rook. 
426,9,21,Bc5,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1pb4b/4q3/1BP4P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK1R1 w Qk -',Black is certainly controlling the game right now. This move though is seen by the computer analysis as a inaccuracy and that Qh4 was best. So true for it threatens the h3 pawn and threatens mate in 1 on f2 with Qxf2#.  
427,9,22,1Bc2,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1pb4b/4q3/2P4P/PPBPNP2/R1BQK1R1 b Qk -',I go and attack the queen. This is seen by the computer analysis as a mistake though and that d4 was the best. Very true for it prevents the c5 bishop from interfering at least for a time. This would prove to be a costly mistake for white. 
428,9,23,1Qf3,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1pb4b/8/2P2q1P/PPBPNP2/R1BQK1R1 w Qk -',Black goes in deeper. Computer analysis sees this as a mistake and that Bxe2+ was the best move. True for then white would have to take it with his king and then black could attack again. (16. ... Bxf2# 17. Kxf2 Qf3+ 18. Ke1. Mate would not be immediately imminent but the position would be bad for white. What I failed to spot in this move though was the major pressure on f2...
429,9,24,1Ng3,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1pb4b/8/2P2qNP/PPBP1P2/R1BQK1R1 b Qk -',...I go and attack the h5 Bishop and hope for a queen's exchange. Computer analysis views this as a blunder and that d4 was again the best move. This is so very true. Why? Because of the next move...
430,9,25,1Qxf2#,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1pb4b/8/2P3NP/PPBP1q2/R1BQK1R1 w Qk -',...which is Qxf2#! The last move is a blunder because this move makes checkmate. The bishop protects the queen so the king cannot take it and with no other white piece on f2 black has won. I still do not know how I missed a move as obvious as this one! Well although too short it was a well-fought and enjoyable battle. I hope you enjoyed this annotation and feel free to rate and comment about it. I will have game 2 annotated as soon as it is complete. 
431,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my traditional opening the King's Pawn Opening.
432,10,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black opens up with the King's Pawn Game a usual response.
433,10,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I play the King's Knight Opening again a popular move.
434,10,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues the King's Pawn Game.
435,10,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White plays the Ruy Lopez exchange variation again a popular move.
436,10,5,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Well this is a move I don't think I've seen in any of my games until now but it is in the book the Ruy Lopez Cozio Defense. 
437,10,6,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',That ends the book. I usually castle when I get the opportunity and in this case it came up real quick.

440,10,9,Nxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',...thus protecting the pawn. 
441,10,10,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I give my e4 pawn protection.
442,10,11,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/3pp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',Black attacks the e4 pawn. Computer analysis sees this as an inaccuracy and that Be7 would be the best move. It would because then black would have the option of castling.  
443,10,12,Nbd2,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/3pp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Computer analysis views this as a mistake. I don't think this is that bad of a move although there were better ones. exd5 is seen as the best move. That is reasonable but I see this move only as a inaccuracy. 
444,10,13,Na5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3b3/n2pp3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Be7 was the best move. Again very true because it gives black the option of castling. There is a good reason why this is a mistake. (See next move)
445,10,14,Nxe5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3b3/n2pN3/4P3/3P3P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Na5 by black allowed me to play Nxe5 this move for the pawn no longer had protection. I now develop a slight advantage. 
446,10,15,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2bb3/n2pN3/4P3/3P3P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Good move by black. I now have to retreat my knight and this puts pressure on h2 which will be a factor later and black can now castle.

449,10,18,Nc4,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2bb3/4N3/2n1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black puts more pressure on white's e5 Knight. 
450,10,19,1Nxc4,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2bb3/8/2N1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I decide and exchange between two 3 point pieces the two knights. 
451,10,20,1Bxc4,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2b4/8/2b1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This move though allows black to attack white's f1 Rook. The rook will have to be moved so it can be protected.
452,10,21,f6,b'r2qk2r/1pp3pp/p2b1p2/8/2b1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Computer analysis views this move as an inaccuracy and that 13. O-O would of been the best. Makes plenty of sense for it gives good protection to black's king. This move however hurts black some because if and when black castles his king won't be protected as well. 
453,10,22,1Nd2,b'r2qk2r/1pp3pp/p2b1p2/8/2b1P3/7P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I attack the c4 Bishop and protect my e4 pawn further but computer analysis views this as a mistake and that e5 was the best move. It's definitely right because then both the knight and the rook would of protected the pawn on e5. 14. fxe5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. Rxe5+ Kf8 (or Kf7) would result with black's king more exposed and unable to castle giving white more of an advantage. 
454,10,23,1Qh5+,b'r2qk2r/1pp3pp/p2bbp2/7Q/4P3/7P/PPPN1PP1/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',I place the first check of the game.

457,10,26,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2bpp/p2b1p2/8/2P1P3/5Q1P/PP1N1PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - c3',I get the c pawn out. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Nb3 was the best move. I'm not certain why but c4 still wasn't a bad move. 
458,10,27,Qe8,b'r3qrk1/1p3bpp/p2b1p2/2p5/2P1P3/1P3Q1P/P2N1PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Be5 was the best. Very true for then I would have to protect my a1 Rook. 
459,10,28,1Ba3,b'r3qrk1/1p3bpp/p2b1p2/2p5/2P1P3/BP3Q1P/P2N1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Bb2 one space back was better. Very true for it would of prevented an attack on the a1 Rook from the d6 Bishop.
460,10,29,1a5,b'r3qrk1/1p3bpp/3b1p2/p1p5/2P1P3/BP3Q1P/P2N1PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Another inaccuracy from the computer analysis. It says this time Qe5 was better. Very true. The a1 rook is fine due to the e1 rook but then black would threaten mate in 1 with Qh2#. I'd prevent that of course but it would put white in a somewhat awkward position. 
461,10,30,2g4,b'r3qrk1/1p3bpp/3b1p2/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BP3Q1P/P2N1P2/R3R1K1 b - g3',Another inaccuracy from the computer analysis. It viewed e5 as the best move. I'm not so sure about that. If black played Bxe5 then white could play Bxc5 but instead black would of likely played fxe5 thus losing white's small advantage so I don't quite view e5 as the best. 
462,10,31,2g6,b'r3qrk1/1p3b1p/3b1pp1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BP3Q1P/P2N1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',Computer analysis views this as a mistake saying again Qe5 was better. I mentioned why this was the best in move 19. This time though black's f6 pawn is unprotected...
463,10,32,2Qxf6,b'r3qrk1/1p3b1p/3b1Qp1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BP5P/P2N1P2/R3R1K1 b - -',...so white's advantage grows to 2. I'm a bit surprised that the computer analysis views this as an inaccuracy. It says again e5 was the best move. Not Qxf6? Whatever the reasoning is my advantage has grown regardless. Of course though black is bound to attack my Queen. 
464,10,33,2Be6,b'r3qrk1/1p5p/3bbQp1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BP5P/P2N1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I must save my queen of course. Computer analysis views this move as another inaccuracy and says that Be5 was a better move. Very Very true. I would have to save my queen but then black could take my a1 Rook which then I would take black's Bishop. (Likely 21. Be5 22. Qf3 Bxa1 23. Rxa1 Be6 24. Qg2 (or around there)). This move doesn't hurt black although they miss an opportunity so that is why it is only an inaccuracy. 
465,10,34,Qf7,b'r4rk1/1p3q1p/3bb1p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BPQ4P/P2N1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',Black prepares for an attack on f2.

Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Bb2 was better. Mostly true. I would now have an opportunity to mate on g7 but black would more than likely continue with their plans and then likely prevent a mate on g7 but overall still the best move. 
469,10,38,2Qg3+,b'r4rk1/1p5p/3bb1p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BPQ2PqP/P2NR3/R5K1 w - -',Black continues their attack with h2. The h3 pawn is gone. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy and that Be5 was the best. Very true for it would prevent a possible mate on g7 which I pointed out on the move before this one.  
470,10,39,Qxh3,b'r4rk1/1p5p/3bb1p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/BPQ2P1q/P2N2R1/R5K1 w - -',As expected the pawn goes but the computer analysis views this as a blunder yes a blunder and that Be5 again was the best. I'd tell you why this is a blunder but I'll show and tell instead for I saw the opportunity. 
471,10,40,2Bb2,b'r4rk1/1p5p/3bb1p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1PQ2P1q/PB1N2R1/R5K1 b - -',I now focus on mate on g7.

I'm not quite certain how that helps or how this move was even any form of a mistake. I do know though that black was in a bad position and that white's advantage has grown to a big advantage. 
475,10,44,2Qg3+,b'r3kr2/1p2b2p/4Q1p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P3Pq1/PB1N3R/R5K1 w - -',Black counters with a check.

477,10,46,3Qd5,b'r3kr2/1p2b2p/3q2p1/p1pQ4/2P1P1P1/1P3P2/PB1N2R1/R5K1 b - -',At least with this move I can promote my pawn structure if a exchange is made. 
478,10,47,3Rd8,b'3rkr2/1p2b2p/3q2p1/p1pQ4/2P1P1P1/1P3P2/PB1N2R1/R5K1 w - -',??? No exchange? It would not matter as much if the b7 pawn wasn't wide open! No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a mistake. It also says that Qb6 was the best move. Reasonable for it protects the b7 pawn. 
479,10,48,3Qxb7,b'3rkr2/1Q2b2p/3q2p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P3P2/PB1N2R1/R5K1 b - -',White's advantage grows to 5.

No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a blunder! The best move would of been Bg5 which does start to develop a good attacking position for black but what's done is done.

483,10,52,3Bg7,b'4kr2/1Q2b1Bp/6p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P3P2/P2r4/R5K1 b - -',I attack black's f8 rook. This move is viewed by the computer analysis as a blunder. (?) I didn't realize that my f3 pawn was wide open. e5 was the best move. This is certainly a mistake but I don't see it as a blunder but black does have an opportunity for an attack now. 
484,10,53,3Rf1,b'4k3/1Q2b1Bp/6p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P3r2/P2r4/5RK1 b - -',I give my king some protection by my rook but this ends up not really helping at all. Computer analysis views this as another blunder and that Qb8+ was the best move. I can accept this being a blunder because it puts white in an even worse position. Black will certainly play Rg3+ and after I move my king to h1 the g4 pawn is lost. 
485,10,54,Bd6,b'4k3/1Q4Bp/3b2p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P4r1/P2r4/5R1K w - -',? What happened to Rxg4? Black's rook doesn't need protection. This is viewed by the computer analysis as a blunder. Why? Because now there was the opportunity for a mate in 2! Alas though I did not see it at all. I am unable to show you the puzzle for the comments do not allow me but check out puzzle #121689 to see how the game would of ended if I did play the sequence. 
486,10,55,3Qf7+,b'4k3/5QBp/3b2p1/p1p5/2P1P1P1/1P4r1/P2r4/5R1K b - -',Blunder by the computer analysis of course. As I said I did not see the possible mate but I had other plans.

Yes it is for then it would drive back the Bishop to probably c7 and the next move would be Rf8#. Not to worry though my next moves will seal black's fate. 
491,10,60,4Rxa2,b'2k5/7Q/3b2p1/p1p5/2P1P1r1/1PB5/r7/5R1K w - -',That pawn doesn't really matter now. The computer analysis views this as a blunder and that Rh2+ was the best move which it is for then I would have no choice but to take the rook with my queen which then black would take with his bishop which then white would take with his King (40. Rh2+ 41. Qxh2 Bxh2 42. Kxh2 Rxe4) leaving white with a shrunken +2 advantage. Yet it was another missed opportunity for black. 
492,10,61,4Be5,b'2k5/7Q/3b2p1/p1p1B3/2P1P1r1/1P6/r7/5R1K b - -',My plan was now in place. My plan was to sneak attack black. Thanks to black's Bishop I cannot play Rf8#.

From about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much it being replaced by Smyslov's idea of 10....Qc7 followed by 11. Rc1 Rd8 but this was rather put out of business by 12. Bf4! so players went back to this older system. To quote from Wiki ""this was frequently played by Karpov including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov in Seville Spain is the Seville Variation after 6...Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0-0 10.0-0 Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+ long thought a poor move by theory as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enough compensation for the pawn."

This seems logical hitting g4 and putting the queen on a white square - which seems logical as white squared bishops have been indirectly exchanged.

For some reason I thought that I had another piece (which there isn't one) on that pawn. I basically just gave up my Bishop. Computer analysis surprisingly views this as a mistake but it's really a blunder. It says Bd2 would of been better.

At this level I understand it very well my response of the Siclian I guess is somewhat unusual for my rating given that it's actually one of the hardest things to learn.  You typically see it more with Masters and GM's.
581,14,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard.
582,14,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Nothing wrong with this move.  It's ok but in my mind better is still 2...Nc6 in this kind of position as it could lead to other well known variations like the Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano.  It's just that a long time ago against Mr. Arboite who was Jack Stockel's assistant at the time I played 2...Nf6 which led to problems.  For after exchanging pawns my K became exposed.  
583,14,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A standard move.  But because of what I noted earlier I would've forced the exchange by taking with 3.Nxe5.  I know that in general one shouldn't move the same piece more then once in an opening.  But remember opening principles are not rules.  Instead they're a set of guidelines to help you in the opening.  While I usually follow this would be one of the few exceptions.  In this situation I feel like I'd get an advantage by taking.  And that way if black responded with 3...Nxe4 then I'd respond with 4.Qe3 immediately gaining tempo by chasing his N away so that I can continue developing. 
584,14,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"Understandable as this move develops a piece.  What I used to think however is that it's in the wrong spot as I was once told that it's generally not a good idea to put your piece on a central square since you need them to control the center.  However I most often go by what Jack Stockel tells me.  And he disagrees with that assessment.  That's because one time I reaches a similar position and I was debating on if I should put my LSB on the center square.  I told what the other's told me about not blocking the center and he said ""There's nothing wrong with it.""  In his opinion you can control the center just as easily whether a piece is on that square or not.  In this case however I have to disagree him simply because black did not develop her d pawn yet.  Now that the bishop is there she'll have to lose time in order to develop her central pawn and as they say ""Time is of the essence.""  This also applies in chess."
585,14,6,d4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',I really like white's response here.  Not only is it developing move but this move does forces an exchange.  After which black will feel a little pressure.
586,14,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',And she handles it the right way.
587,14,8,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Now you don't typically see this move.  Normally the LSB does come out as was the case but most often Bc4 or Bc5 are played in this position.  However once in a blue moon this is the move.  For example if I were playing this game this is what I would've played as well.  And I've done that in my recent past games.  What I like about it is not only does it develop another piece and gets Gerhard ready to castle but at the same time it adds protection the e4 pawn.  In addition as noted earlier this choice does not compromise or put restrictions on the center since white played 4.d4.
588,14,9,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/3b1n2/2p5/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',I like black's choice.  What I recently learned and just by being a spectator not by being told anything is that this attack is actually a very common and well known variation.  This kind of position has appeared several times in my games Mr. Stockel.
589,14,10,Nf5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/3b1n2/2p2N2/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',At first I was wondering why chicoboy didn't play 7.Ne3 as it's the most common move.  Afterall this also what I would've done.  However this move is actually better then it looks and the reason that white played this was to gain tempii.  The reason is that black has to protect her DSB.
590,14,11,Be5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1bN2/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',! Best in my opinion.  Another option though was 7...Be7 with the idea of exchanging her DSB for white's N.  But I now see why she didn't as I made this kind of mistake in my game against caveman1960 and I would've made the same error here.  Well it looks like the DSB is black's weak B.  But it's actually the opposite.  As it turns out this is her strong B and it's even stronger then white's N.  So she needs that piece.
591,14,12,Nd5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pNbN2/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Since that plan won't work white intends to exchange.  And this time black abides since her B is stronger.  Afterall she doesn't need that N.
592,14,13,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPbN2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',So black now decides to take advantage of her opportunity by continuing with development.  The only thing is that she has a little catching up to do since white is slightly ahead in that department given that he has one more piece out.  But that's soon going to change as black will catch up shortly.
593,14,14,1Qg4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPbN2/6Q1/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',At first I didn't know why Gerhard played this.  White's N was protected by his LSB so he doesn't have to worry about the loss of tempii as everything is even.  Black was going to take with 10...Bxf5 but then white can recapture with 11.Bxf5.  However the plan behind this is to mate black on h7 once he takes.  Will this plan work?  Stay tuned.
594,14,15,g6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3p1p/3p2p1/2pPbQ2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Best however was to retake with 11.Bxf5 as opposed to 11.Qxf5?!.  So as it turns out the plan did not work.  @chicoboy: I've made this mistake before.  Having said that the problem is that the plan is too obvious so it can easily be driven off.  For that very reason it's called a cheapo tactic also known as unsound aggression since you're building an aggressive plan without creating a real problem for the opponent.  After which you're faced with problems.  That's because black will gain tempii afterwards which will allow her to get ahead in development.  In fact she might complete it whereas you'll be continuing to develop.  This is why in one of his recent articles the World Champion Magnus Carlson said that cheapo tactics are not a good thing to attempt because it'll often cause you problems.  And that's a well known chess fact that I had to learn the hard way in some of my past games.   
595,14,16,Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1p1p/3p2p1/2pPb3/8/3B3Q/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',And this is how black takes advantage of white's mistakes.  I used to think that development wasn't complete until the Q comes out but I recently learned that once you're castled and all of the minor pieces that's when development is complete.  So black now has a slight edge.
596,14,17,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1p1p/3p2p1/2pPb3/5P2/3B3Q/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ f3',Very understandable the idea here is for white to gain tempii in order to catch up on development.  The only problem here is that this move makes it unsafe for him to develop.  So instead I would've developed my the DSB right then and there with something like 13.Be3.
597,14,18,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/5P2/3B3Q/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',!? Normally I would mark with a !.  But because of his last move better would've been to develop his DSB and then castle Q side believe it or not.  This move might expose white's K because his K is not completely protected since the e pawn has moved.  I know because I've done that before and this has immediately exposed my K. 
598,14,19,1Nb6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p2p1/2pP4/5P2/3B3Q/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The idea here is for black to get her N off of the d file without placing it on the rim so that she can get her Q out.
599,14,20,1c3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p2p1/2pP4/5P2/2PB3Q/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',? At first I didn't understand why this was played.  But now it makes perfect sense.  With this move white can develop his remaining piece and keep his b2 pawn safe at the same time.  However a mistake because it loses a pawn.  Best was 15.Qf3 to protect it. 
600,14,21,1Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pn4/5P2/2PB1Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This time what white played is just as good as bringing the DSB out.  This move should gain tempii and tempo is absolutely essential.  
601,14,22,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/3n4/2p2P2/2PB1Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? However this is what she played and it's a blunder  With this move white should win a free piece.  If this happens everything changes and white will go from a slight disadvantage to an advantage.  While Gerhard would still be behind in development he would be ahead in material which is even more important.
602,14,23,1Bxc4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/3n4/2B2P2/2P2Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',However white does not find the move.  Best was 17.Qd5! as it wins a piece as noted on above.  And that's what I would've played.  Now material is still even and the circumstances regarding development are still the same.  In fact black now gains time once she retreats because it packs a counter attack against white's LSB.
603,14,24,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p2p1/8/5P2/1BP2Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I don't know what this move accomplishes.

605,14,26,1a5,b'1r1q1rk1/1p3pbp/1n1p2p1/p7/5P2/1BP2Q2/PP4PP/R1B1R1K1 w - a6',Not sure but my guess is that black moved with the idea being that in the long term probably near the endgame this will become a passed pawn.
606,14,27,2a4,b'1r1q1rk1/1p3pbp/1n1p2p1/p7/P4P2/1BP2Q2/1P4PP/R1B1R1K1 b - a3',If that's the case white intends to prevent that from happening.
607,14,28,2Nd7,b'1r1q1rk1/1p1n1pbp/3p2p1/p7/P4P2/1BP2Q2/1P4PP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I don't why black moved there.
608,14,29,2Be3,b'1r1q1rk1/1p1n1pbp/3p2p1/p7/P4P2/1BP1BQ2/1P4PP/R3R1K1 b - -',And now it happened.  White just completed his development.  With that being said everything is even.  Too soon to tell but in my mind best play might lead to a draw.
609,14,30,2b6,b'1r1q1rk1/3n1pbp/1p1p2p1/p7/P4P2/1BP1BQ2/1P4PP/R3R1K1 w - -',Connecting her pawns.  This is actually a good idea because it's well known that two connected pawns are often dangerous when it becomes an endgame.  If this is what black kept in mind then we know that she's thinking and planning ahead.
610,14,31,2Rad1,b'1r1q1rk1/3n1pbp/1p1p2p1/p7/P4P2/1BP1BQ2/1P4PP/3RR1K1 b - -',Not bad and this probably what I would've done to as it brings rooks together.  Not only that but this move attacks black's d pawn.  This time however it's not the best reason since black easily protect it without the loss of tempo.  Having said that better might have been 22.Re2 as it would enable to double his R's on the next move.  Afterall doubled R's are extremely dangerous.  This is actually one way that caveman1990 defeated me in our Caro Kann challenge. 
611,14,32,2Nc5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/1p1p2p1/p1n5/P4P2/1BP1BQ2/1P4PP/3RR1K1 w - -',As noted earlier this move protects the d6 pawn.  In addition it counter attacks.
612,14,33,2Ba2,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/1p1p2p1/p1n5/P4P2/2P1BQ2/BP4PP/3RR1K1 b - -',? But this retreat is a mistake.  While it protects his LSB this move loses a pawn after 23...Nxa4 so best was 23.Bc2 keeping both his B and a pawn protected.
613,14,34,2Bc1,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/1p1p2p1/p7/n4P2/2P2Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 b - -',I understand the intention here as this move protects white's b2 pawn and keeps the c3 safe as well.  But I think that a better alternative was for Gerhard to bring one of his R's on the second rank.  Not only does it do the same thing but at the same time it keeps everything in tact because this move undevelops white's DSB.
614,14,35,2b5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/pp6/n4P2/2P2Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 w - -',I don't know why black played this.
615,14,36,2Bb3,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/pp6/n4P2/1BP2Q2/1P4PP/2BRR1K1 b - -',In the meantime white decides to take pressure off of the b file by attempting to force an exchange.
616,14,37,2Nc5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/ppn5/5P2/1BP2Q2/1P4PP/2BRR1K1 w - -',But black won't allow it.
617,14,38,2Ba2,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/ppn5/5P2/2P2Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 b - -',! To prevent black from attacking with her a pawn white played this.  I think that it was a good choice as it prevents him from losing tempii.
618,14,39,2b4,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/p1n5/1p3P2/2P2Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 w - -',So instead black attempts to force an exchange.
619,14,40,2c4,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/p1n5/1pP2P2/5Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 b - -',But white declines it and instead plays this.  The goal is to get a passed pawn with this move.  On a normal basis I would've have exchanged but not this time.  In that I think that chicoboy made the right choice.  That's because in general you don't want to exchange when you're behind as it gives you less defend with.  Knowing that fact I think that black had that in mind which is why she played 26...b4.
620,14,41,2b3,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/p1n5/2P2P2/1p3Q2/BP4PP/2BRR1K1 w - -',So instead black attempts to win his LSB.
621,14,42,2Bb1,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/p1n5/2P2P2/1p3Q2/1P4PP/1BBRR1K1 b - -',But white doesn't allow it.  
622,14,43,2a4,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/2n5/p1P2P2/1p3Q2/1P4PP/1BBRR1K1 w - -',However while it's not an endgame yet black's a pawn is already becoming very dangerous.  And if she plays ...Ra8 that will wind up happening.  In fact she'll then wind up with a winning advantage because that move will win material.  Having said that with best play black should win.
623,14,44,2Be3,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3p2p1/2n5/p1P2P2/1p2BQ2/1P4PP/1B1RR1K1 b - -',Well this move redeploys black's DSB.
624,14,45,2Qc7,b'1r3rk1/2q2pbp/3p2p1/2n5/p1P2P2/1p2BQ2/1P4PP/1B1RR1K1 w - -',"Not sure why black played this.  But best was 29...Ra8!! for the reasons that I outlined earlier black would have a winning advantage due to his extra pawn.  And that's also why it's also well known that in general ""Don't give things way.""  Afterall just one pawn is usually what makes or breaks a game and this a perfect example."
625,14,46,3Bd4,b'1r3rk1/2q2pbp/3p2p1/2n5/p1PB1P2/1p3Q2/1P4PP/1B1RR1K1 b - -',! and nearly !!  At first I wasn't sure why but white is trying to and will exchange bishops.  However this move is much better then it might appear.  What white calculates is about happen.  After the exchange black attacks his e R enabling Gerhard to double his R's.  
626,14,47,a3,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/q1n5/2PR1P2/pp3Q2/1P4PP/1B1R2K1 w - -',? White however has a small problem which he's about to deal with very easily.  That's his a pawn.  But this time once he exchanges black's passed pawn is gone ending the main threat.  In addition this move is a mistake because once everything is said and done white can win back a pawn.  So in my mind better was still 32...Ra8 for the same reason as noted before.  Not sure but I think that the advantage still would've been there.
627,14,48,3Qc3,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/2n5/2PR1P2/qpQ5/6PP/1B1R2K1 b - -',But white does not find the move and instead plays this.  As it turns out 34.Rxd6 was best as that's the move that would've won the pawn back.
628,14,49,3Na4,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/n1PR1P2/qpQ5/6PP/1B1R2K1 w - -',Instead black hit's on white's Q.  
629,14,50,3Qc1,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/n1PR1P2/qp6/6PP/1BQR2K1 b - -',Normally this counterattack would be ideal because of tempo gain but because of black's next move it does the opposite.  
630,14,51,3Qc2,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/n1PR1P2/q7/1pQ3PP/1B1R2K1 b - -',But white still has some kind of plan.  What is it?  To force a draw by repetition.  But black is not going to allow it.
631,14,52,Qxf2+,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/n1PR1P2/8/1p3qPP/1B1R2K1 w - -',The plan however almost worked and it would've had black played 39...Qc1.   
632,14,53,4Kxf2,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/n1PR1P2/8/1p3KPP/1B1R4 b - -',So white's going to look for different opportunities.
633,14,54,4Nc3,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/2PR1P2/2n5/1p3KPP/1B1R4 w - -',In this position black intends to make white nervous so that Gerhard will blunder a piece away.  However that plan is not going as black will find a way around it.  I know what it is black thought that she had a successful N fork.  But as we know it's not so easy and it usually doesn't work as the opponent can make one move that ends as is this case.  That's why doesn't pay off to play move like this as most things like this really aren't forking moves.  But black has another plan that's actually quite good.
634,14,55,Rfd8,b'1r1r2k1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/2PR1P2/2n5/1p3KPP/1B2R3 w - -',"Since that plan did not work black at last protects has another.  She protects her d pawn.  The question becomes what is white going to do?  And it's that kind of question that Mr. Stockel asks me when he asks ""Now what?  What are you going to do?"""
635,14,56,4Rd3,b'1r1r2k1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/2P2P2/2nR4/1p3KPP/1B2R3 b - -',Well this is what he does.  The idea is to put pressure on black's N.  
636,14,57,4Rb3,b'3r2k1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/2P2P2/1rnR4/1p3KPP/1B2R3 w - -',This time however black will not be pressured.
637,14,58,4Ke3,b'3r2k1/5p1p/3p2p1/8/2P2P2/1rnRK3/1p4PP/1B2R3 b - -',Now that it's near an endgame the K starts to become a powerful.  And when it finally becomes the K is extremely important almost as much as the Q believe it or not.
638,14,59,4d5,b'3r2k1/5p1p/6p1/3p4/2P2P2/1rnRK3/1p4PP/1B2R3 w - -',Why did black play this?  Afterall this move is a mistake because it loses a pawn after 44.cxd5 or does it.  
639,14,60,4Kd2,b'3r2k1/5p1p/6p1/3p4/2P2P2/1rnR4/1p1K2PP/1B2R3 b - -',! As it turns out it doesn't and this move is the right response and proof that your K becomes a powerful weapon in the endgame since we're now approaching that stage.  As it turns out 43...d5 was a trap that black saw.  Had white would've lost instantly had he played 44.cxd5??  Why?  After black recaptures with 44...Nxd5 white loses at the very least his d R for black's N and probably much more.  Having that this is best as now the K is the weapon that will prevent black from achieving her goals.  So instead black forces a long exchange variation so that material wise white doesn't lose any more.
640,14,61,Rc8+,b'2r3k1/5p1p/6p1/8/2K2P2/8/1p4PP/1R6 w - -',! This move is quite good.  Otherwise white would automatically win back the pawn he lost with 48.Rxb2.
641,14,62,4Kd3,b'2r3k1/5p1p/6p1/8/5P2/3K4/1p4PP/1R6 b - -',However white could've still tried to win it by playing 48.Kb3.  Would that have worked?  Probably not as then black could respond with 48...Rb3.  However he could still try with the idea being that after ward he play 49.Kc3 Rc8  And if that happened three times in a row white would achieve his goals that he had earlier a draw by repetition. 
642,14,63,4Rc1,b'6k1/5p1p/6p1/8/5P2/3K4/1p4PP/1Rr5 w - -',? Normally this move would be ideal extraordinarly brilliant and henceforth worthy of !!.  That's because white would normally have to give up his R in order to prevent the black's b pawn from promoting.  I know because this is how Jack Stockel has defeated me in a couple of drawish endgames.  So this would normally be a winning move.  But this however is a mistake because in this particular position white doesn't have to sac his R.  Instead he can and will win back a pawn with 49.Rxb2.  And there's nothing that black can do about that.
643,14,64,h5,b'6k1/5p2/6p1/7p/5P2/3K4/1R4PP/2r5 w - h6',So black comes up with another plan.  The for connecting her remaining pawns is to keep them protected so that one of them can promote.  Like before normally that would work but it won't in this position.
644,14,65,5h4,b'6k1/5p2/6p1/7p/5P1P/3K4/1R4P1/2r5 b - h3',! Best in my opinion was 50.g3 for the exact same reason.  But this move is almost as good because it prevents black's h pawn from advancing any further so that it can't promote.
645,14,66,5f5,b'6k1/8/6p1/5p1p/5P1P/3K4/1R4P1/2r5 w - f6',! And white has the same idea.
646,14,67,5Kd4,b'6k1/8/6p1/5p1p/3K1P1P/8/1R4P1/2r5 b - -',I'm not exactly sure why white played this.  He might however have been trying to use his K as a weapon and there's nothing wrong with it.  But in that case 51.Kd2 would have been the best way to do that as it attacks black's R in a powerful way.  
647,14,68,5Kf7,b'8/5k2/6p1/5p1p/3K1P1P/8/1R4P1/2r5 w - -',Like before I don't know why black this.  Perhaps to achieve the opposition.  Either way this is a drawn position and if I were black I would've went from preventing the by repetition to offering a draw.  And if anyone offered it to me I would've accepted the offer.
648,14,69,5Rb7+,b'8/1R3k2/6p1/5p1p/3K1P1P/8/6P1/2r5 b - -',I don't know why but at this point black resigned.  However this wasn't necessary because as noted above it is a drawn position.  Aside from that both ivyiv and chicoboy both played well but there's some for black and even more for white to learn as this particular game could've gone either way.  And what you're about to learn are the morals of this story.  First remember don't give things away and don't leave anything en-prise.  For instance black left her piece hanging with 16...c4.  Now had white played 17.Qxd5! as opposed to 17.Qxc4 chicoboy would've had a winning advantage as he would be up two points ahead as opposed to a pawn down.  And black would've won had she played 29...Ra8!! as opposed to 29...Qc7 because she was a pawn ahead.  In addition that extra pawn was the real danger.  Plus her b and a pawns were connected.  So a R right on top of that would've won a lot of material.  Second @chicoboy: unless your in a lost position where you try anything to stay in and hope for counter play so for a swindle in general unsound aggression is not good.  When you threaten an immediate mate it's a good idea to ascertain that the threat is difficult to drive off and not easy.  Basically as difficult as the opponent having to sac material in order to avoid mate.  Otherwise you will wind up with problems once your opponent sees the threat and reacts to it.  The perfect example was 11.Qxf5!? as once black responded you fell behind in development allowing black to complete it much quicker whereas it took you a lot longer to catch up.  Remembering these lessons will help you to become a better player.

Here is a game which ended in a Low Draw for Yours Truly.  I got greedy in the middlegame with some pawn grabbing that backfired on me.  Under normal circumstances 3 pawns for the piece is enough compo. and indeed the material count is zero.  However if the extra piece is a bishop and there is a pair of them and you have a knight then heaven help you!  I found myself in that very position and thankfully Heaven did save me 10 rating points but boy it was a struggle.  So how did all this happen? Well read on ......."

Thierry decided not to play out the 50 move rule and he mentioned the fact that he thought the game was drawn in the chat.  I therefore hit the Offer Draw button and thankfully he accepted.  Well my next annotation is coming up soon and that will certainly be worth waiting for!
690,16,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"I adore Alekhine's defense - this may be because it is an opening one is told repeatedly not to play and its naysayers have a ver serious point. Unlike others of my pet openings (specifically Reti and the Dutch) - which are unpopular but still played at the grandmaster level - this one is specifically considered sub-standard and many theoretical articles on the subject will say that Nf6 is not a serious reply to 1.e4. 

Nonetheless I have found that it is in fact quite playable *if* you play it often and prepare well. The biggest problem with Alekhine's in my opinion is not the tempo loss from 2.e5 Nd5 but the sheer instability of the structure. Simply stated you have to memorize variations - a lot of variations - because so many moves are playable for white and several of them lead to fundamentally different structures with a TON of tactical traps that either player can fall in to. The plus side to this memorization chore is that Alekhine is rare at all levels of play and if you prepare you will reach very sharp very tactical positions which you know and your opponent does not - the result is that your opponent is busy calculating while you're still playing on book. 

This particular game is one I played against someone who usually plays more precisely than I do on the whole - he is consistently 100+ points higher rated and a dedicated e4 player. The first time I used Alekhine's defense against him he played 2.d3 and went on to win after squeezing out a middle game advantage (and I played a howling blunder at the end...oops). After that loss I developed a refined system for 2.d3 and this game is I think a beautiful example of that preparation coming to fruition. "
691,16,1,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"?

This variation is much better for black I think - d3 cuts off the light square bishop whose job it is to hold up the squares weakened in the initial pawn advance. Nc3 is OK if you want to avoid some of the theory (though on gameknot the 'main line' of Alekhine - e4 Nf3 e5 Nd5 c5 Nb6 d4 d6 Nf3 Nc6 - is hardly ever played so I have lines memorized for d3 f3 and Nc3 that I actually know *better* than what grandmasters consider the main line). In general I think this move is typically played out of confusion - the opponent wants an e4 e5 position so (s)he wastes a tempo pushing a pawn in order to encourage me to play e5 and transpose......however I will never oblige - this is Sparta!!!"
692,16,2,Bxb6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1Bn5/8/2P5/3P4/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',"?

My pawns will be doubled - this is true (and *never* resolved in this game) but one of the concessions made in the 2. d3 variation is that black will usually be able to get her hands on the d4 square and use it to stage an attack. If you're keeping score the pawns have advanced (leaving weak squares behind them) the f1 bishop is controlling a pitiful ONE square and the c1 bishop has been traded for a knight whose main job is to play decoy dummy. Once the dark square bishop is removed I have two pieces pointing at that lovely d4 square - no pawns can protect it and Nf3 is the only move that even pretends to keep it under control.

This is going to be a difficult game for white...."

I feel like Nf3 should have been played - pin be damned. This is a time to cut your losses get d4 under control and stop me from using the square as a base of operations. "

This attack serves no purpose as the tempo gain of forcing me to move the queen is totally offset by her ability to exploit the dark squares - she's only too happy to move deeper in to white's territory! The e4 square is great for knight if you can keep it there but I also have an unused f pawn itching to jab from f5. All in all this move again does not address the real problem: I'm fixed on d4 and until you can kick me off of it you'r'e going to have a difficult game"

1118,18,23,Kf5,b'8/8/8/pp1p1k2/5P1p/P1P1K2P/8/8 w - -',38. ..... Kf5 - I now realise that if Kd4 Henry will be able to have a couple of white p(r)awn crackers on the kingside and get a reunion with Glenda before Chris has had a chance to crown one of his queenside pawns.
1119,18,24,3Kf3,b'8/8/8/pp1p1k2/5P1p/P1P2K1P/8/8 b - -',39. Kf3 - it looks as though I am now in a zugzwang.  However .......
1120,18,25,3d4,b'8/8/8/pp3k2/3p1P1p/P1P2K1P/8/8 w - -',39. ...... d4!! - pawn sac.

1122,18,27,axb4,b'8/8/8/5k2/1p1P1P1p/5K1P/8/8 w - -',41. ..... axb4 - and a passer on the queenside where it matters most!

1125,18,30,Ke5,b'8/8/8/4k3/7p/1pK4P/8/8 w - -',46. ..... Ke5 - I was remembering another endgame with Chris in which I left King Chris to hoover up my queenside pawns in order to crown a kingside pawn.  My very first game with him in fact!  Poor Chris is gonna get a real case of Deja Vu here!
1126,18,31,Kg3,b'8/8/8/8/7p/2K3kP/8/8 w - -',48. ..... Kg3.  There is absolutely no way King Chris can prevent Henry from consuming the last white pawn on the board and preventing my solitary black pawn from reaching Glendadom a few moves later.  Chris waved the white flag a few moves later.  This was a very tricky king and pawn ending which could have gone either way but thankfully for me it went my way.  Next up for discussion will be an endgame involving K & R v K B and R but that is gonna wait until next time.  See you later!  Kind regards - Joanne

1133,19,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I respond with the Scotch Relfsson Gambit which I usually play in the Scotch.
1134,19,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As expected white responds with the Scotch game.
1135,19,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black goes ahead with the Scotch Ghulam Kassim variation.
1136,19,8,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',As I expected the Scotch continues.
1137,19,9,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black continues the Scotch. 
1138,19,10,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',The Scotch ends. So with the traditional game openings over with anything can happen at this point.
1139,19,11,c5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq c6',White attacks the queen.
1140,19,12,Qa4+,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/Q3P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Not what I totally expected but this can easily be countered.
1141,19,13,f6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b2pp/3p1p2/2p5/4P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Based on computer analysis: Mistake. Best: Bc6. I can see why. The b7 the pawn was completely unprotected so white could gain a slight advantage here both in points and in position.
1142,19,14,Bb5,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b2pp/3p1p2/1Bp5/4P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Fortunately for black white instead responds with Bb5. The computer analysis sees this as a mistake of course.
1143,19,15,Bxb5,b'r2qkbnr/pp4pp/3p1p2/1bp5/4P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I decide to except a swap although this will put me in check again.

There was no need for this for it takes away a somewhat strong piece from white and only a measly pawn for black. The computer analysis of course views this as a mistake. Along with that the computer analysis said that black had a advantage until now of course.
1155,19,27,1axb6,b'1k1r2nr/3qb2p/1p1p1p2/6p1/4P3/2NQ2P1/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',I take as expected.

1183,19,55,3Bxh2,b'1k1r4/2q4p/1p6/8/R7/3Q4/PPP4b/2K5 w - -',I take the h2 pawn. The computer sees this as a blunder and says Bf4+ was the best move and for good reason. If I played that white's queen was gone. 31. Bf4+ and then either 32. Rxf4 Rxd3 or 32. Kb1 Rxd3. Either way white's queen would of been lost and checkmate would of been right around the corner. I missed an opportunity but the next one was right around the corner.

More common is 1.d4 as it can lead to different variations like the QG.  So 1.d4 d5 2.e5.  Or the King's pawn with 1.e5.  But what you don't typically see however is a pawn that only advances one square.  Usually I don't emphasize it because this is a central pawn.  The only thing however is that it's not studied by top players.  Now Jack Stockel has advised me to play opening that are studied and analyzed by masters and grandmasters and this point is indirectly implied in the ""Deeper Chess Theory Club""."
1220,22,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And my comment with this move is the same about 1.d3.

But he's also coordinating those pieces which should make it easier to control the center.  And that's because as GM Susan Polgar emphasized in using openings to think like a GM while developing you're pieces have to be coordinated to control the center.
1224,22,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/8/2NP1N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Same thing.

Mainly Material balance but also space.  The problem here is that with this move is that white creates a weakness for himself in which black can exploit with 4...e5.  If this happens not only would white lose tempii given that his DSB would be attacked.  But that would give black better control of the center because that move would develop a center pawn.  And remember: in the opening the most important files are d and e as that's how you control the center.
1226,22,7,Bf5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/5b2/5B2/2NP1N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',?! the problem with this move is the same before.  But this time white will take advantage of it.  But will he however find the right response?  That is the move that I would play?

But I would have 5.e5 because that gains tempii at the same time as controlling the center.  And with that he would have had a slight advantage.  But now things are still even.
1228,22,9,g6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2np1np1/5b2/5B2/2NP1NP1/PPP1PP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',She is also getting ready to fianchetto her B.  The only thing is that archduke_piccolo told me that trying to fianchetto anything usually takes more time by an extra move when you could already use that move to bring something into play.  That's in general so I usually don't do that.  This time it's not a problem because the center pawns unfortunately have not yet been developed on either side.
1229,22,10,e4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2np1np1/5b2/4PB2/2NP1NP1/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq e3',Now this is a good developing move.  And as noted this is what I would've played a move earlier.  But it makes no difference the results are the same.  With the idea of space and center he used to that tempii to achieve that.  So he has better control of the center which gives him a slight edge at this point.
1230,22,11,Ng5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2np1np1/6N1/4PBb1/2NP2P1/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"?? This however is serious blunder.  What Jason forgot is that because black retreated with 6...Bg4 his N was indirectly to the Q.  So ""almost anything was better then this move"" as this move loses a Q for a B.  Plus white's K is vulnerable to exposure because after 8.Kxd1 he can no longer castle which is also part of the third thing on that checklist. And now with best play black should win.  But in my mind white does the right thing by not resigning because there is just one question which remains to be seen.  Can black keep her advantage? "

Unfortunately this doesn't due to one fact.  And as you get more experience it doesn't matter as much but @Erika: Remember that a Knight on the rim is dim.  Meaning that it should not be on the endfiles.  Otherwise the opponent has more opportunities to attack it whereas there's less room for the N to escape.  Plus it makes the N worth less.

This move is actually better and that's because the most important concept in my opinion is material relationship.  While they're all important this one in particular outweighs everything as it's the thing that makes or breaks a game.  By doing what white did he avoided an exchange.  That's an important strategy because when you're behind it's more often then not a bad idea to exchange.  It's well known that people like to exchange when ahead as it gives the opponent less to defend.  Jason saw that and her plan and his response to the threat was good.

BTW @Eirka and Jason: chess terms are very important since chess is also a language.  Now fianchetto=putting your B on the longest diagnol.  That's the case in this position since the diagnol of black's DSB extends from h8 all the way to a1.

And although he can't castle white just completed his development and there is a way to make for the loss of castling.  But a lot of thinking however is required to do so.  It seems simple of just lifting the K up moving the R directly right and bringing the K back to d1.  However there's way more to it then meets the eye.

In order for it to work his other R would have to be on c1.  And more often then not there are ways out of it so it isn't really a fork in that case.  And the problem here is that by moving the N white just create another weakness which his opponent will take advantage of.  He left his b pawn enprise vulnerable to attack and black will take it winning another pawn and adding to her advantage.

But and while that's part of the strategical aspects as talked about earlier it's not the best move.  When we count material relationship white's best response was either 13.Rxb2 or 13.Nxb4.  Both moves win back a piece and lose some of black's advantage.
1240,22,21,1Ng3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3N2N1/1n2P1P1/3PB1nB/PbP2P1P/1R1K3R w - -',?? Best outpost for black was 13...Ng7.  And while I generally don't like this because it creates a structural disadvantage around the K it was the only sure way to protect her N.  So now white has one more way to get back some compensation and win material.
1241,22,22,1Rg1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3N2N1/1n2P1P1/3PB1nB/PbP2P1P/1R1K2R1 b - -',And he still could've taken back but instead attacks the N.  You have to base things on the position usually material like winning or losing it is more important the tempii.  But once in a while tempo is more important.  This however is not one of those times.  Now black has no way to prevent white from a winning back a piece.  So now some of Erika's advantage is gone.
1242,22,23,Nxa2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3N2N1/4P1P1/3PB2B/nbP1KP1P/1R4R1 w - -',?? I understand this move very well as it's the kind of thing that I used to do.  Black thought that she had advantage and the only thing on her mind is to exploit white's weakness.  Yes that's important to think about and apply as it's part of thinking ahead.  But just as important is calculating accurately.  And unfortunately black miscalculated because she overlooked Jason's R.  This makes a difference space and material relationship btw because white can and will take blacks DSB with 16.Rxb2.  So now in addition to compensation she lost a piece for a P.  And with that little by little white's starting to regain his advantage believe it or not.  So in the short term this move is a blunder.  But in the long term it's also an error because of what's about to come.
1243,22,24,Nc3+,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3N2N1/4P1P1/2nPB2B/1RP1KP1P/6R1 w - -',The idea was to check.  But now you have to ask yourself two questions.  First is this check helpful or harmful.  Second is it serious or just a nuicanse.  This check was a nuicanse.  But after the this move black's N was trapped another reason why in the long term 15...Nxa2 was a blunder.  Now if white finds the right response he should win it.  And despite being a Q behind if this happens all of black's advantage will be gone and in fact will have a slight edge as he'll be slightly ahead paradoxically. 
1244,22,25,1Kd2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3N2N1/4P1P1/2nPB2B/1RPK1P1P/6R1 b - -',Unfortunately black does not however find the right response.  17.Nxc3 was best as this is the move that would've given white the advantage.  With this choice it becomes an even exchange and white is still behind.
1245,22,26,c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2pp2p1/3P2N1/6P1/3PB2B/1RPK1P1P/6R1 w - -',Given that she's still ahead black intends to exchange.
1246,22,27,1Bd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2pp2p1/3P2N1/3B2P1/3P3B/1RPK1P1P/6R1 b - -',? I don't know why he played this.  In this case white had to exchange with 19.dxc6 and there was no way out of it.  Sine white had doubled pawns there was no way to advance it for protection which is what I did in a recent game against him.  This is the disadvantage of having doubled pawns it's about pawn structures.  And two pawns on one file weakens that.  So with this move black is going to win another pawn for free.
1247,22,28,2Rg3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/3B2P1/3P2RB/1RPK1P1P/8 b - -',I understand this move.  It get's white's last piece out and achieves mobilization.  While there's nothing wrong with this move I would've preferred 20.Rb1 doubling his R's.  And that's because while not in this position it's good practice because in general doubled rooks are very dangerous that can pose immediate mating threats even when you're behind.  However I would've recaptured immediately with 20.Rxb7.  However that move will be played sooner or later.
1248,22,29,2Qa5+,b'r4rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/q2p2N1/3B2P1/3P2RB/1RPK1P1P/8 w - -',Again you have to ask yourself it is a good or harmful check.  And if it's a nuicanse or serious.  I think this check was harmful because white can and will get out of it.  And he'll gain some needed tempii to get out of it.  Note: Even if we're not in the beginning stages tempii is still very important.  In fact it's usually most important in the endgame.
1249,22,30,Qc5,b'r4rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2qp2N1/6P1/2BP2RB/1RPK1P1P/8 w - -',! Remember when I said that white could immediately recapture that pawn.  Well with this move it's now too little too late because once white takes black recaptures with 22...Qxf2+.  However anything can change drastically so stay tuned.
1250,22,31,Qg1+,b'r4rk1/pR2pp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/2BP2RB/2P4P/2K3q1 w - -',?? But this is a very serious blunder which I think I know why black however moved here.  She probably thought that this move was an automatic back rank mate but miscalculated and overlooked white's R which is about to do some serious damage.  Best was 23...Qxh2 gaining back even more of the advantage that she lost.  Had black played that she probably would've won in the long run.  With this move however black not only loses her advantage but white now has a winning advantage.  Here's the thing @reachforgoals:  if there were three pawns surrounding the K so in addition to c2 b2 and d2 it would be mate.  However the K can escape.  And to make matters even worse white can and will win back a Q.  So before moving one thing that ties into material relationship is calculating and asking yourself if there's anything you're missing.  Then analyzing to figure out if there's anything your opponent can do about it and if you're plan will work or be counterproductive.  Meaning: That it does the opposite of what you achieve and/or if it will cause damage.  This is a perfect example. 
1251,22,32,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pR2pp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/2BP3B/2P4P/2K3R1 w - -',Given that she's now behind black tries to compensate.  And she does with the second checklist by posing a direct threat.  The idea though basing on the structures is that she wants to win white's DSB.
1252,22,33,2Rf1,b'2r2rk1/pR2pp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/2BP3B/2P4P/2K2R2 b - -',?? This time I don't know why white moved there but he overlooked the threat.  Best was to retreat his attacked but instead left it hanging.  Therefore black is going to win something back.  
1253,22,34,2Rxe7,b'5rk1/p3Rp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/2rP3B/2P4P/2K2R2 b - -',"And despite white getting a pawn in exchange there's something important for both players to remember.  So I am not basing on who's ahead or not at the moment.  The important concept and strategy in many cases and it's a well known fact btw.  But pieces are worth more then pawns.  While not completely true if it's an even exchange one way to remember is as elyhim would say ""Exchange pawns not pieces.""  "
1254,22,35,2Ra3,b'5rk1/p3Rp1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/r2P3B/2P4P/2K2R2 w - -',"Understandable and actually this is very similar to what I would've done.  The idea here is that based on the positional aspects this time this move does protect black's a7 pawn.  The idea being and what normally happens is that this kind of move prevents the immediate loss of another pawn.  But in this position that is not the case because ""There's always another way of doing something.""  And here white is going to win a pawn.  That's because when we look after 27.Rfx7 even when black does take bake white has his rooks connected+ his g5 N whereas black doesn't.  So even if and when black were to recapture with ...Rxf7 with the rook nearby and the N on g5 white then quick plays Rxf7.  Now had the R's not been side by side and the N not where it is white would not dare to take the pawn or he's lose a R in exchange."
1255,22,36,Ra1+,b'5rk1/p3RR1p/3p2p1/3p2N1/6P1/3P3B/2P4P/r1K5 w - -',The idea here is that once white gets out of check black would win back a R and everything would henceforth be even after 28...Rxf7.  But that is not the case because of what I mentioned above.
1256,22,37,Kg7,b'8/p3RNkp/3p2p1/3p4/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/r7 w - -',? This time I have no idea why black played this.  Best however was 29...Ra6 protecting the d6 pawn.  But with this move however black is going to lose another pawn with a discover check.  Note: @reachforgoals and hiredgun112: a discover check occurs when you have a position like but you get put in check by removing a defender.  Meaning: moving pawn or piece that allows another piece right behind to put the player in check.  One example will occur when white plays 30.Nxd6+
1257,22,38,Kf8,b'5k2/p3R2p/3N2p1/3p4/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/r7 w - -',? I understand what black was trying to accomplish as it's how I used to think.  Since black's now far behind the idea was to pressure white so that he'll blunder.  By doing this black would win back a piece the R.  In which case black would've equalized.  @reachforgoals: the problem here and in general is that the plan doesn't work and it won't in this case either.  White has ways out of it and in fact with this move he is going to win another pawn.  So what's important to remember is material relationship what's being threatened calculation and strategies.  And this is even more of a reason why applying that 7 point checklist is very important. 
1258,22,39,Ra6,b'5k2/p6R/r2N2p1/3p4/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/8 w - -',Trying to win white's N.
1259,22,40,3Nf7,b'5k2/p4N1R/r5p1/3p4/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/8 b - -',But as we know it's about asking yourself what being threatened which white just did.
1260,22,41,3Kg8,b'6k1/p4N1R/r5p1/3p4/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/8 w - -',I don't know what this move accomplishes.  
1261,22,42,3Ng5,b'6k1/p6R/r5p1/3p2N1/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/8 b - -',My guess is that white is trying to find a mating sequence against black.  The question here is how can he do it?  If his LSB weren't blocked by his g pawn it would all make sense.
1262,22,43,3Rf6,b'6k1/p6R/5rp1/3p2N1/6P1/3P3B/2PK3P/8 w - -',Black still wants counter play so she wants and is planning to put her opponent in check with 33...Rf2+ after which she'll win back a pawn.
1263,22,44,3c4,b'6k1/p6R/5rp1/3p2N1/2P3P1/3P3B/3K3P/8 b - c3',But this is a perfect example of thinking ahead which is what I'm trying to get reachforgoals to do.  He sees the threat and moves here to prevent that from happening.
1264,22,45,3dxc4,b'6k1/p6R/5rp1/6N1/2p3P1/3P3B/3K3P/8 w - -',So black takes.
1265,22,46,3d4,b'6k1/p6R/5rp1/6N1/2pP2P1/7B/3K3P/8 b - -',"Normally this isn't bad but this move can mess up the pawn structure.  And despite being ahead with a winning advantage white must be careful in order to avoid throwing that away.  Remember: ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning position be very careful and don't underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and losing the game.""  The reason that I'm emphasizing that right now is because while it might not appear so black's a pawn is very dangerous.  So white has to do something in order to prevent black from getting a passed pawn.  Plus while it doesn't matter here in general if there black had more then just her c pawn surrounding the d pawn and white played this black would be able to just continue advancing the d pawn so she wouldn't have to take another.  If that were the case then the d pawn would have potential something that one must be very careful about as that blends in with part of the concepts and theories as well."
1266,22,47,3c3+,b'6k1/p6R/5rp1/6N1/3P2P1/2p4B/3K3P/8 w - -',? So black check's with the idea that she can promote her c pawn.  But as noted above because black does not have any pawns surrounding the c file she will not achieve her goals.  In fact this move is another mistake because it gives away another pawn.
1267,22,48,a5,b'6k1/7R/5rp1/p5N1/3P2P1/2K4B/7P/8 w - a6',So now she's trying to promote her a pawn.
1268,22,49,3Bg2,b'6k1/7R/5rp1/p5N1/3P2P1/2K5/6BP/8 b - -',Don't why he played this but better was 37.Kb3 to stop the promotion.  The only thing is that black could protect and get a passed pawn 37...Ra6.  So to prevent all of that best was 37.Bf1. 
1269,22,50,3a4,b'6k1/7R/5rp1/6N1/p2P2P1/2K5/6BP/8 w - -',Still trying to promote.
1270,22,51,3Bd5+,b'6k1/7R/5rp1/3B2N1/p2P2P1/2K5/7P/8 b - -',But white reacts by placing black in check.  Let's see what else he has in mind.
1271,22,52,3Kf8,b'5k2/7R/5rp1/3B2N1/p2P2P1/2K5/7P/8 w - -',Indirectly forced as the only other choice would've been 38...Rf7?? but that would lose a R. 
1272,22,53,3Kb2,b'5k2/7R/5rp1/3B2N1/p2P2P1/8/1K5P/8 b - -',! Very smart move.  Now that we're in the endgame the K's become very powerful weapons.  Believe it or not almost as much so as the Q.  And this will certainly prevent black from promoting her a pawn.
1273,22,54,3a3+,b'5k2/7R/5rp1/3B2N1/3P2P1/p7/1K5P/8 w - -',? Still wanting to promote but this time the check was harmful.  Best might have been 39...Ra6 in which case the a pawn would still be very dangerous.  But this move loses yet another pawn.
1274,22,55,Ra6+,b'5k2/7R/r5p1/3B2N1/3P2P1/K7/7P/8 w - -',Nuicanse yet understandable check.  When I'm faced with a position like this I'd do anything to stay in.  Now at this point I would resign in this position given that any hope of counterplay would be gone.  But as we're about to see even in a position with no chance of that happening it's still better to stay in as we will see later on.
1275,22,56,Rb6+,b'5k2/7R/1r4p1/3B2N1/1K1P2P1/8/7P/8 w - -',Still doing anything to pressure Jason.
1276,22,57,4Kc5,b'5k2/7R/1r4p1/2KB2N1/3P2P1/8/7P/8 b - -',But now white put's a squeeze on black.
1277,22,58,4Rb7,b'5k2/1r5R/6p1/2KB2N1/3P2P1/8/7P/8 w - -',?? Serious blunder.  Black either should have retreated to the first or second rank.  With this she's going to lose another R without much left.
1278,22,59,4Bd5+,b'6k1/7R/6p1/2KB2N1/3P2P1/8/7P/8 b - -',It might look that good and it seems like the move doesn't accomplish.  While that might seem so the plan though is very good and shows that white is thinking ahead.  The idea is to get black in a mating net.  This would normally work but there is one way out of this.
1279,22,60,4Kf8,b'5k2/7R/6p1/2KB2N1/3P2P1/8/7P/8 w - -',Directly forced this time.
1280,22,61,4Rd7,b'5k2/3R4/6p1/2KB2N1/3P2P1/8/7P/8 b - -',Don't know why white played.    But I'm not going to annotate every move as we already went into a lot of theory and concepts.  In fact I'm only planning to annotate one more before the very end. Plus despite being far behind black is not going to lose her remaining pawn.  PS white is not going to place black in any more checks.  And remember when I said that I would've resigned.  Well white miscalculates so this game is going to end in a draw.  Proof of why it's actually better to stay in the game as opposed to resign.
1281,22,62,4d5,b'5k2/3R4/4B1p1/2KP2N1/6P1/8/7P/8 b - -',?? This might seem fine as you may ask ok what else could white have done and is any move better then the other.  Well the thing is that this a super blunder despite not losing material.  The reason here is that Jason missed an immediate mate in 3.  With this move however the game is going to end in a draw as black can now find different ways and strategies to force a stalemate as opposed to a checkmate.
1282,22,63,Kf8,b'2K2k2/7R/3PB1p1/6N1/6P1/8/7P/8 w - -', 
1283,22,64,5d7,b'2K2k2/3P3R/4B1p1/6N1/6P1/8/7P/8 b - -',There is a lot for both players to learn from this game as it could have gone either way this game had more twists and turns then any other game that I've annotated before.  The main lessons are first apply the concepts strategies tactics positional aspects theory and basics into your games.  Second thinking ahead is important but also calculating.  Third which blends in with the third concept is not only development but developing in the right spot to for center control since controlling the center is extremely important.  For instance white tried to take advantage of black's weakness by attempting to put pressure on her K with 7.Ng5.  But what Jason forgot was that his N was indirectly pinned to the Q.  So by moving it he lost a Q for a B.  Later on after losing some advantage black miscalculated by playing 23...Qg1+ which allowed white to win back the Q and handed the advantage back to white.  Whereas 23...Qxh2 would have given black more of her advantage back so she would've had almost as much as earlier.  And @Jason and Erika: In the beginning despite developing your B's you them in a place where both could be chased and that actually happened with black.  Afterwhich white chased and had a slight edge before any blunders as he had better control of the center.  Now the main problem is that some of the mistakes that I've seen have been reoccurring and when this happens you don't learn from the first time.  That's another reason why I really decided to go into depth and get both of you into the big picture which is theory as well as everything that goes into the game.  Now if you can remember these lessons you both will become much stronger players.

The game was still quite playable but to be honest I was laughing at myself at this point. I congratulate Mr. Hernandez and promise him a rematch soon. I might even continue with this game at this position just to show that the game is still playable. Oh and if you're wondering why Mr. Hernandez's rating is so low? He had a bad tournament. He only won one game and drew one against some low rated players.

Basically at around the 45th move my opponent (who've I've redacted the name in order to avoid the ""naming and shaming game"" though I'm happy to edit it back if the accuser continues on) accused me of using a computer. I don't have the exact logs which were deleted by him but the conversation went something like this:
xxx: Your computer is very fast.
xxx: That's right no response.
me: Wait what?
me: You think I'm cheating?
me: Why?
xxx: Don't lie only weak players use computers.
me: I'm not cheating.
xxx: Liar.
me: Can you explain to me why you think I'm cheating.

At this point my opponent deleted the chat even after I asked him for an explanation as I wanted to sort it out with him. So there was nothing left to do but block him.

Anyway I'm commenting this game and I want to know from people whether my game looks like a computer cause I sure as hell don't see it."

I know this might sound pedantic but I forgot the two basic rules in correspondence chess: One never play when you're stressed and two it's just a game in the end.

1835,33,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the Alekhine's Defense. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4 d4 e5 and f4. It's an aggressive choice by my opponent.

I am really chuffed that a mating attack of mine against a former Expert has been so successful and I hope there will be more of these to come!  For now read and enjoy - Kind regards - Joanne
1890,35,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Here I'm white playing the sicilian in a blitz game.
1891,35,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Well Nc3 could could be fine but I have a huge preference on open lines and attack. A lot of players on gameknot do Bc4 but I don't think it's that great because there is too much counterplay after that.
1892,35,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! There is a lot of good possibilities with the sicilian in the opening. Most of the time people continue with Nc3 or Nb5 here but since it's rare that I come to that line I wanted to try Bc4. Bc4 was not the best option here since e6 blocks the way to the king and sometime there is a lot of counterplay with Na5 or a6+b5. I think however that it can be useful later in the game.
1893,35,3,Bb4+,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bBNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?! It give too much of counterplay and tempo for white. Ne6 would have been a better option. 
1894,35,4,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bBNP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I didn't wanted to do Nc3 because after Bxc3 bxc3 my pawn structure would have looked bad. It's true that I would have gained some open lines and the bishop but I don't think it was an enough compensation. Bd2 could have been a nice possibility giving me some nice tempo. c3 give the possibility to continue with b4 and a4 later and to secure the center.
1895,35,5,Nxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/2BnP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',? Very bad idea. Black waste again some tempo and lose the center.
1896,35,6,a6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb2p3/8/2BPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! Black should have done Ne7 here to be able to castle quickly.
1897,35,7,1d5,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb2p3/3P4/2B1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Trying to take profit of my greater development.
1898,35,8,1exd5,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb6/3p4/2B1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! Ne7 would have been probably better.
1899,35,9,1exd5,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb6/3P4/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Thinking about to do Re1+.
1900,35,10,1Qf6,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb3q2/3P4/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! I think d6 was mandatory here.
1901,35,11,1d6,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb1P1q2/8/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',!! Now black will have an hard time to continue his development.
1902,35,12,1Bd4,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/p2P1q2/8/2Bb4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Giving the possibility to capture the d pawn and to do b5.
1903,35,13,1Ne4,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/p2P1q2/8/2BbN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',? Nd4 and the game would have been practically over with the threat of Qxd4. Well I was thinking about something bigger.
1904,35,14,Bxf2+,b'r1b2knr/1p1p1ppp/p2P4/4q1N1/2B5/8/PP3bPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',! This sac took me by surprise probably the only way for black to continue playing.
1905,35,15,1b3,b'r1b2knr/1p1p1ppp/p2P4/6N1/2q5/1P2R3/P4KPP/R1BQ4 b - -',! Giving some accesses for my bishop.
1906,35,16,1Qf4+,b'r1b2knr/1p1p1ppp/p2P4/6N1/5q2/1P2R3/P4KPP/R1BQ4 w - -',? Very bad mistake.
1907,35,17,2Qe2,b'r1b2k1r/1p1p1ppp/p2P1n2/6N1/7q/1P3R2/P3Q1PP/R1B3K1 b - -',Threating Qe7+ then Qxf7#.
1908,35,18,2a4,b'r1b2k1r/1p1p1ppp/p2q1n2/6N1/P7/1P3R2/4Q1PP/R1B4K b - a3',! The queen must move to not get pinned by the bishop.
1909,35,19,2Rd1,b'r1b2k1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/6N1/P2q4/BP3R2/4Q1PP/3R3K b - -',The fun is over.
1910,35,20,2Rf8#,b'r1b1kRnr/1p4p1/p2Q3p/6N1/P7/BP6/6PP/7K b - -',Mated.
1911,36,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pn4/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',When seen against White's 11th move B-Q3 this seems to be a loss of tempo but if White plays 7 B-Q3 Black need not exchange on QB6. 
1912,36,1,Nxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2BP4/2n1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black should have delayed this exchange as long as possible.
1913,36,2,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2BP4/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',After 9 BPxP B-N5 ch 10 B-Q2 BxB ch 11 QcB O-O 12 O-O P-QN3 Black has a very comfortable game.
1914,36,3,1Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/8/3P4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',A better move was 11 Q-K2. 
1915,36,4,g6,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bp1p/1pn1p1p1/8/3P4/2PB1N2/P1Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The continuation 12... P-KR3? 13 Q-K2 B-N2 14 Q-K4 costs Black a Pawn.
1916,36,5,1Bb5,b'r1bqr1k1/p3bp1p/1pn1p1pB/1B6/3P4/2P2N2/P1Q2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',With this move White achieves the advance P-QB4 thus preventing the blockade of his hanging Pawns but at the cost of exchanging his very active Bishop.
1917,36,6,1Rac1,b'b1rqr1k1/4bp1p/pp2p1pB/4N3/2PP4/8/PQ3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',White now has only slight prospects of an attack against Black's King and must keep his hanging Pawns covered.
1918,36,7,1b5,b'b1rqr1k1/4bp1p/p3p1pB/1p2N3/2PP4/8/PQ3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',This decides the game strategically. 
1919,36,8,Qd5,b'b1r1r1k1/4bp1p/p3p1pB/1pPqN3/3P4/8/PQ3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',A better continuation is 20... B-Q4 after which Black can post his Q on QN2 and use his Q-side majority.
1920,36,9,f6,b'b1r1r1k1/4b2p/p3pppB/1pPqN3/3P4/5P2/PQ4PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black wants to cut off the B on his KR3 but there is little logic in this plan. His two B's and blockade of the Q pawn give him a positional advantage therefore it was unjustifiable to allow tactical complications.
1921,36,10,2h4,b'b1rr2k1/4b2p/p1q1pp1B/1pP3p1/3P3P/4NP2/PQ4P1/2RR2K1 b - h3',Black's faulty play on the 21st move already makes itself felt although he still has the better position.
1922,36,11,Rd5,b'b1r3k1/7p/p3pbqB/1pPr2p1/3P2N1/5P2/PQ4P1/3RR1K1 w - -',A blunder that leads to a quick loss. After 29...B-KR1 or even 29... B-Q4 the position remains complicated but in my opinion Black has the better prospects.
1923,36,12,3Qxd4,b'b1r3k1/7p/p3R1qB/1pPr2p1/3Q2N1/5P2/P5P1/3R2K1 b - -',Black had overlooked this move. If 31... RxQ 32 RxQ ch he loses a piece and after 31... QxR??? 32 Q-N7 mate. So Black resigns.

I have been thinking more about the thread that Coach Ion started about Pawn Majorities in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Club.  I have two perfect examples of play between one of my fellow Club Members Patzerblitzer (Chris) a Class B Player who is in Master Freddy (Easy19's) mentoring group C.  In both games Chris played the opening and the middlegame very well but alas for him it all went awry in the endgame.  Why did this happen?  Well somehow I managed to utilse pawn majorities in the endgame to my advantage and sadly this meant that it did not work out for Chris.  So here is the first of these two games and Chris lurves to kick off with 1. d4 and I usually follow suit with d5."
2026,38,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. e3 - opening up a line for his lsb.
2027,38,2,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ...... Bf5 - development and hitting out at c2.
2028,38,3,f4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',3. f4 - hmm this is becoming a Stonewall.
2029,38,4,Nf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nf3 - both sides develop their king knights.
2030,38,5,Qxd3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/3QPN2/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',6. Qxd3 - bishop trade.

2032,38,7,Ne4,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PnP2/1N1QPN2/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',9. ...... Ne4 - time for a little equine entrenchment.
2033,38,8,Ndf6,b'r3k2r/ppq1bppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PPnP2/3QPN2/PP1N2PP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',11. ..... Ndf6 - bolsters this entrenched knight.

2035,38,10,Nfe4,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2p1p3/2Pp4/3PnP2/3QPNnP/PP1N2P1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',14. .... Nfe4 - both steeds back each other up.  I try and put a choke on Chris' position but can I make further progress?  We shall see.
2036,38,11,f5,b'r4rk1/ppq1b1pp/2p1p3/2Pp1p2/3PnP2/3QPNnP/PP4P1/R1B1RNK1 w - f6',15. ...... f5 - with the idea of a rook lift to f6/g6/h6.

2038,38,13,Bf6,b'r5k1/ppq3pp/2p1pb1r/2PpNp2/3PnP2/3QP2P/PP1B2PK/R5R1 w - -',20. .... Bf6 - hmm maybe Bh4 might have been better.  You the Inquest Jury decide!

2043,38,18,2Rxg4,b'6rk/pp2q2p/2p1p2r/2PpP1p1/1B1Pn1R1/4P2P/PP2Q2K/5R2 b - -',27. Rxg4 - pawn trade.

I think you have guessed it.  It is a typical jstevens1 ploy - when there is pressure trade trade trade!
2045,38,20,3Qxf1,b'8/pp2q1kp/2p1p3/2PpP1pr/3Pn1R1/4P2P/PP4K1/4BQ2 b - -',32. Qxf1 - this rook trade now only leaves the Witch on the f file.  Next comes a queen trade.
2046,38,21,h6,b'8/pp3k2/2p1p2p/2PpP1pr/3Pn1RP/4P3/PP4K1/4B3 w - -',34. ...... h6 - bolsters my g5 pawn.
2047,38,22,hxg5,b'8/pp3k2/2p1p3/2PpP1p1/3Pn3/4P3/PP4K1/4B3 w - -',36. ...... hxg5 - over the last few moves my mits have been hovering over the Offer Draw button.  However after the recent trades I now consider myself effectively a pawn up.  I remembered my Expert Lesson in Pawn endings from Paolo about 5 years back when material was even but one side was left with doubletons.  That time it was me and I learned never to trade down to a pure king ending with the doubleton.  In this case it is Chris with the doubleton and if he exchanges down to that king ending well .......
2048,38,23,Kh6,b'8/pp6/2p1p2k/2PpP1p1/3Pn1K1/4P3/PP6/4B3 w - -',38. ...... Kh6 - trying to keep the opposition and put Chris in a zugzwang.  However he does still have a strong dsb so it might well come down to the 50 move rule before I agree a draw.
2049,38,24,Kg6,b'8/1p6/p1p1p1k1/2PpP1p1/3Pn1K1/PP2P3/8/4B3 w - -',40. ...... Kg6 - now it is I who must avoid the zugzwang.  My knight has no moves!
2050,38,25,4b4,b'8/1p6/p1p1p1k1/2PpP1p1/1P1Pn1K1/P3P3/8/4B3 b - -',41. b4 - not a good idea - now it is Chris' bishop who is suddenly left with no moves.  What a conundrum!
2051,38,26,4Kh6,b'8/1p6/p1p1p2k/2PpP1p1/1P1Pn1K1/P3P3/8/4B3 w - -',41. ..... Kh6 - but at least Henry does!
2052,38,27,Kh5,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP1pk/1P1Pn3/P3P2K/8/4B3 w - -',42. ..... Kh5 - so after Chris has been forced to retreat his king Henry moves onwards and upwards.
2053,38,28,g4,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP2k/1P1Pn1p1/P3P3/6K1/4B3 w - -',43. ...... g4 - suddenly I have this passed pawn just 3 squares from Glendadom wow and double wow!
2054,38,29,4Bg3,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP2k/1P1Pn1p1/P3P1B1/6K1/8 b - -',44. Bg3 - om om om uh oh Chris!  I now have a chance to exchange into a king and pawn ending but will my ravenous sea food loving king find any juicy p(r)awns?  We shall see.
2055,38,30,Kg5,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP1k1/1P1P2p1/P3P1K1/8/8 w - -',45. ..... Kg5 - the importance of the opposition can be worth an extra queen in the ending!  Now King Chris must retreat.
2056,38,31,Kh4,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP3/1P1P2pk/P3P3/6K1/8 w - -',46. ..... Kh4 - and Henry puts the squeeze on!
2057,38,32,g3,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P3k/4P1p1/6K1/8 w - -',47. ..... g3 - now only 2 squares to reach utopia!
2058,38,33,g2+,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P4/4P2k/6p1/7K w - -',49. ...... g2+ - my pawn forces King Chris into a stalemate position.  The pawn on g2 will be consumed by King Chris but look at all those lurvely juicy white p(r)awns!  Henry is in for a feast!
2059,38,34,5b5,b'8/1p6/p1p1p3/1PPpP3/P2P4/4P1k1/6p1/6K1 b - -',51. b5 - hoping to push one of his queenside pawns to promotion.  However after a long analysis I now set up some conditional moves.  Never you fear Henry is just about to have the time of his life!
2060,38,35,bxc6,b'8/8/p1p1p3/2PpP3/P2P4/4Pk2/6p1/6K1 w - -',52. ...... bxc6 - the Joblock works to deadly effect.  Chris is absolutely starved of any counterplay whatsoever on the queenside.
2061,38,36,Kxe3,b'8/8/p1p1p3/P1PpP3/3P4/4k3/6p1/6K1 w - -',53. ..... Kxe3 - gobble!
2062,38,37,Kxd4,b'8/8/p1p1p3/P1PpP3/3k4/8/6K1/8 w - -',54. ...... Kxd4 gobble!
2063,38,38,Kxe5,b'8/8/p1p1p3/P1Ppk3/8/5K2/8/8 w - -',55. ..... Kxe5 - yum yum!  It ain't over yet!
2064,38,39,d4+,b'8/8/p1p1p3/P1P1k3/3p4/4K3/8/8 w - -',56. ..... d4+ now the white pawns on c5 and a5 are absolute sitting ducks!
2065,38,40,e5,b'8/8/p1p5/P1Pkp3/3p4/8/2K5/8 w - -',58. ...... e5 - it is gonna be a black pawn race to Glendadom!
2066,38,41,e4+,b'8/8/p1p5/P1Pk4/3pp3/3K4/8/8 w - -',59........ e4+ - King Chris is driven back.
2067,38,42,Kxc5,b'8/8/p1p5/P1k5/3pp3/8/2K5/8 w - -',60. ...... Kxc5 - after Henry devours yet another pawn Chris waves the white flag.  Commiserations Chris.  I think you were in this game until your decision to exchange down to a pure K & P ending.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow I will have part 2 ready for you very shortly.  Until then bye for now - Joanne

I assume 6.Qxf6 7. Qxg4 but then I realise he can move Qxf2 ouch.  check and capture the bishop on f1 and I've opened up a can of worms.  But after further analysis I realise I have an escape route around the back d2 -c3-b3 then when he cant check me he becomes vulnerable.  My queen can move to c8 and capture g7 depending on what he does.  Even retreating his queen at some point I believe I can still have a small material advantage. Castling I can move my dark squared bishop to h6 to give him problems. The trouble is though am I leaving my king out in the open too much??  Will I set myself up for a fall.  He's still not made his move so I will have another look when he captures my knight with the queen should that be what he does.

2080,39,12,Kd2,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4P1Q1/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B2qNR b kq -',I want him now to go f2 preferably but Qf6 would be acceptable.  Should he castle I will have to possibly move to c3 without being forced
2081,39,13,Bxg1,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P1Q1/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B2qbR w kq -',I wasn't expecting that. I didn't come across it when analysing that could cause problems.
2082,39,14,1Rxg1,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P1Q1/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B2qR1 b kq -',I nearly missed this and immediately put my queen on c8.  I figured out in the end that my rook was lost and it would possibly be rook for rook but this way I get his bishop as well. 
2083,39,15,1Qc8+,b'rnQ1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B3q1 b kq -',here is the check
2084,39,16,1Ke7,b'rnQ4r/ppp1kppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B3q1 w - -',Qxb2 I thought was an option until I saw he could movie his knight.
2085,39,17,1Qxh8,b'rn5Q/ppp1kppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PPK2PP/R1B3q1 b - -',So i'll take the rook
2086,39,18,1Qxg2+,b'rn5Q/ppp1kppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PPK2qP/R1B5 w - -',check
2087,39,19,Qg6,b'rn5Q/ppp1kppp/3p2q1/4p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 w - -',Hmmm I was hoping he captured h2 then I would have checked him Bc5 then hopefully Ke6 Qe8# or f6 Qxg7 then see what happens.
2088,39,20,1Qc8,b'rnQ5/ppp1kppp/3p2q1/4p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 b - -',This move is to capture b7 then a8 I cant see an escape for the rook.
2089,39,21,1c5,b'rnQ5/pp2kppp/3p2q1/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 w - c6',This confused me.  He must know I would go Qxb7 what is this for. It also opens up the check.  
2090,39,22,1Qxb7+,b'rn6/pQ2kppp/3p2q1/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 b - -',I looked up everywhere and I cant see a way for him to get anywhere near my king so this seems safe.
2091,39,23,1Ke6,b'rn6/pQ3ppp/3pk1q1/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 w - -',He's on e6 I wonder if there is a way to mate him here as he cant move to d5 or f5
2092,39,24,1Qxa8,b'Qn6/p4ppp/3pk1q1/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 b - -',Rook capture at the minute will be ok for now.  Nc6 I capture.  Na6 Qc8+ Qxa6 capture. Nd7 Qe8+ Kf6 Qxd7 capture.
2093,39,25,1Qxd7,b'8/p2Q1ppp/3p1kq1/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP4P/R1B5 b - -',All as predicted
2094,39,26,1Qg2,b'8/p2Q1ppp/3p1k2/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP3qP/R1B5 w - -',I hadn't spotted it until now but.......
2095,39,27,1Qxd6#,b'8/p4ppp/3Q1k2/2p1p3/4P3/P1KP4/1PP3qP/R1B5 b - -',CHECKMATE!!!!
