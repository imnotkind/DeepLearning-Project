0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Pretty standard opening.  You know how it goes.
1,0,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This was a little unusual.  I more commonly see either Bc4 (usually leading to the Italian Game or sometimes the 2 knights defense) or Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez).  Black's most popular responses are Nf6 and Bc5 although crazier responses like f5 might be effective against some.
2,0,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I don't like the positions arising for black after Bc5 so I went with Nf6.
3,0,3,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',The scotch four knights!  I know I've seen this before somewhere... Morphy used this to destroy Paulsen with the black pieces.  http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1259998
4,0,4,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I decide to play a little differently.  My idea is to pin the Nc3 castle kingside and aim my pieces at his kingside.  I may end up with doubled pawns on the queenside but that shouldn't be as important as my attack!
5,0,5,Nxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As expected.  NxN followed by QxN doesn't look promising for black as white will control too much space.
6,0,6,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Pinning the knight as planned.
7,0,7,Nxc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Giving me the doubled pawns and a choice of how to do it.
8,0,8,bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Far superior to dxc6 as that allows white to get the queens off; if white can make it to an endgame my doubled pawns will prove a weakness!
9,0,9,Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Simple standard development plus this protects the e4 pawn which could have been taken otherwise.  (Note that for example 7. Bc4 Nxe4 8. Qe2 Qe7 9. f3 can be met by a knight retreat while 9. Bd2 can be met with 9. ...Bxc3 leaving black up a pawn.)
10,0,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Not allowing any thoughts of a pin down the e-file anyway.
11,0,11,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Likewise and breaking the pin on the c3 knight.
12,0,12,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - d6',An aggressive move gaining space for black while also offering to undouble his pawns opening the c8 bishop's route to the kingside and staking a claim to the center.  All this is book so far.
13,0,13,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is an unusual (but not unsound) move; but I've definitely got to do something about this pin.  e5 if played here instead would be met by Ng4 but now if white plays e5 unimpeded my knight is in for a world of hurt!
14,0,14,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2pp1/2p2n1p/3p2B1/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I thought this was the best way to break the pin although 9. ...Bxc3 10. bxc3 dxe4 would have been another way to do it.
15,0,15,1Bxf6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2pp1/2p2B1p/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',?!  A surprise from white -- I had expected Bh4 provoking further weaknesses in black's kingside.  As it is I'm happy to get such a good square for my queen and to win the two bishops so easily!
16,0,16,1Qxf6,b'r1b2rk1/p1p2pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Natch.
17,0,17,1Na4,b'r1b2rk1/p1p2pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/Nb2P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? This move by white threatening nothing and moving the knight far away from the center gives black a clear plan of attack.  Aim the bishops at the kingside connect the rooks lift one onto either the 5th or 6th rank and try for a mate on the kingside.
18,0,18,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/p1pb1pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/Nb2P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Connecting the rooks and allowing the possibility to double down the e-file or b-file.
19,0,19,1Qe2,b'r4rk1/p1pb1pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/Nb2P3/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',?! White doesn't realize the danger that's coming.  I thought Qf3 was best here trying to exchange the queens where black doesn't have much to attack with but is better heading into an endgame.
20,0,20,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/Nb2P3/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Unfortunately white's last move also put his queen onto the half-open e-file.  White's queen probably isn't too happy about black's move here either.
21,0,21,1c3,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2p2q1p/3p4/Nb2P3/2PB4/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I assume this was the point behind 11. Na4 but who does this really help?  White's Na4 now has nowhere to retreat to if black plays c5 and kicking the bishop out of b4 just invites it to harass... white's king!
22,0,22,1Bd6,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb1q1p/3p4/N3P3/2PB4/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',The best square for the bishop.  White must now address the threats of dxe4 and c5.
23,0,23,1Qc2,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb1q1p/3p4/N3P3/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',At least this gets the queen out of the way and protects the a4 knight.  White can play dxe4 but there is a better move...
24,0,24,1Qh4,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/3p4/N3P2q/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',!  A very good in-between move; threatening mate on h2 and pretty much forcing white to weaken his kingside by moving a kingside pawn.
25,0,25,1h3,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/3p4/N3P2q/2PB3P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',"I had expected g3 and had even gone so far as to prepare a (not forced) line 15. g3 Qh5 16. Be2 Qe5 17. Rf-e1 Bh3 18. exd5 Qxd5 19. f3 Bc5  20. Nxc5 Qxc5  21. Kh1 Qf2 22. Rg1 Rxe2 and black wins.

Instead black has to come up with another line."
26,0,26,1dxe4,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/8/N3p2q/2PB3P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',This is a good way to go as it forces the Bd3 to move and allows a rook lift to the kingside.
27,0,27,1Bc4,b'r3r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/8/N1B1p2q/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Preventing the rook from using e6 and also pinning the f7 pawn.  This move also has the drawback of allowing e3 to discover an attack on the bishop which proves an important tactic in some lines.
28,0,28,1Re5,b'r5k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/4r3/N1B1p2q/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',If Re6 is out Re5 will have to do.  Rg5 and Rh5 both look threatening for black.
29,0,29,1Rae1,b'r5k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/4r3/N1B1p2q/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/4RRK1 b - -',I don't know whether this is the wrong rook or not but it's definitely the right square as it prevents the Re5 from moving for the time being.
30,0,30,1Rae8,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/4r3/N1B1p2q/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/4RRK1 w - -',"But the response is easy to find.  Let's take stock now; black has two bishops two rooks and a queen all actively ready to attack white's king.  White has two rooks boxing the king's escape route a knight off-side (that at least prevents Bc5) and a queen and bishop a long way from the defense of the white king.  

Where did he go wrong?  I'm going to blame the faulty plan of white's 10th-13th moves which allowed black to build up the attack he has now.

Now it's up to white to do something to try to stop black's attack!"
31,0,31,1Re3,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/4r3/N1B1p2q/2P1R2P/PPQ2PP1/5RK1 b - -',Probably the best move in the position as it prevents the e-pawn from advancing and also prevents black from playing Bxh3 winning.
32,0,32,1Rg5,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/6r1/N1B1p2q/2P1R2P/PPQ2PP1/5RK1 w - -',Renewing the threat of Bxh3 as after Rxh3 black plays Qxh3 and white cannot recapture due to the pin on the g2 pawn.
33,0,33,1Kh1,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2pb3p/6r1/N1B1p2q/2P1R2P/PPQ2PP1/5R1K b - -',The white king runs for his life but there is nowhere to hide for long!
34,0,34,1Bf4,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2p4p/6r1/N1B1pb1q/2P1R2P/PPQ2PP1/5R1K w - -',"!  This move forces the action and black had to work out that no matter what white does there's no defense against the attack.

If 19. g3 Qxh3 wins; if 19. Rxe4 Rxe4 20. Qxe4 Rxg2! wins (after 21. Qxg2 Bxh3) and if 19. Bxf7  Kxf7 is just fine for black."
35,0,35,2Rxe4,b'4r1k1/p1pb1pp1/2p4p/6r1/N1B1Rb1q/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/5R1K b - -',I'm excited now because 20. Rxe4 Rxe4 21. Qxe4 Rxg2! is so pretty...
36,0,36,2Qd3,b'6k1/p1pb1pp1/2p4p/6r1/N1B1rb1q/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/5R1K b - -',"Ah!  And now white realizes that Qxe4 loses but now he's just down a rook for nothing.

At this point I decided that the best way to win was to just get white's pieces off the board..."
37,0,37,2Rxc4,b'6k1/p1pb1pp1/2p4p/6r1/N1r2b1q/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/5R1K w - -',"And this move seals the win as Qxc4 is met by Bxh3 winning the house and Qxd7 is met by Rxa4 winning another piece.

White resigns (0-1) and it goes to show that doubled pawns are only a weakness if you get to exploit it -- more space and better development are often worth doubled pawns!  Hope you enjoyed it.

38,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game is a stark example of what can happen when a player goes after material to the neglect of all piece development.
39,1,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',I don't normally play the King's Gambit but was in the mood for something particularly aggressive...
40,1,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I have played this line a few times and it has led to the Muzio Gambit. I haven't had a lot of success with it although gothicgirl has beaten me with it many a time.
41,1,3,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2p5/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',In addition to taking away the queen's knight's most natural developing square Black's move seems rather slow. White's rapid development gives him sufficient compensation for the pawn. Shredder recommends either 5...Nc6 or 5...g4.
42,1,4,Qb6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pbp/1qp5/8/2BPPpp1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQNRK1 w kq -',Black is already a pawn up; he does not need to go pawn hunting when he has almost no development. His light squared bishop is locked in and his queen's bishop has no available squares other than a6. I had expected Black to try to disrupt my kingside with 7...f3 or possibly to give the pawn back with the rapidly developing 7...d5.
43,1,5,d5,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3pbp/1qp5/3p4/2BPPpp1/2P5/PP4PP/RNBQNRK1 w kq d6',This would have been stronger the previous move.
44,1,6,exd5,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3pbp/1qp5/3P4/2BP1pp1/2P5/PP4PP/RNBQNRK1 b kq -',With little hope of Black castling anytime soon the e-file looks deadly.
45,1,7,1Bxf4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3pbp/1q6/2pP4/2BP1Bp1/2P5/PP4PP/RN1QNRK1 b kq -',Of course 10.dxc5?? Qxc5  would lose the bishop on c4. This move which puts control of the f-file in White's hands is much superior. The pawn on b2 is of no consequence - White is playing for mate.
46,1,8,1d6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3pbp/3P4/2p5/2BP1Bp1/2P5/Pq4PP/RN1QNRK1 b kq -',White could have held onto the rook with 11.Nc2 and in fact that is what my computer recommends. 
47,1,9,Qb2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3pbp/3P4/2p5/2BP1Bp1/2P5/PqN3PP/1N1Q1RK1 w kq -',Other than his nearly trapped queen Black's only developed piece is his bishop on g7 and even that piece scope is limited by the well defended pawn on d4. Compare White's queen two bishops and rook all of which actively participate in the attack.
48,1,10,1Bg5,b'rnb2knr/pp3pbp/3P4/2p3B1/2BP2p1/2P5/PqN1Q1PP/1N3RK1 b - -',Here my computer gives a beautiful line that I missed involving a queen sacrifice. 14.d7 Bxd4  15.Nxd4 Bxd7  16.Bd6  Kg7 17.Qe5  f6 18.Qg5 !! fxg5 19.Bf8  Kg6 20.Bf7.

50,1,12,1Bxf6,b'rnb2knr/pp4bp/3P1B2/2p5/2BP2p1/2P5/PqN1Q1PP/1N3RK1 b - -',This pawn was White's last obstacle to mate.
51,1,13,Nxf6,b'rnb2k1r/pp5p/3P1n2/2p5/2BP2p1/2P5/PqN1Q1PP/1N4K1 w - -',Black is the equivalent of an entire queen up in material but of course this does not matter with mate on the board!

53,2,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Kasparov's favorite reply to 1.e4. The Sicilian is a dynamic system which rightfully portrays Kasparov's characteristic style a mixture of positional subtlety and ruthless aggression. Always willing to complicate even at the cost of material yet ever patient always waiting for the right moment to strike. If necessary improving his position or playing defensive then continuing his attack when he feels he is secure.
54,2,1,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In the Open Sicilian White allows Black to trade off the c-pawn for the d-pawn opening the c-file. In return white has a spacial and development advantage over black but only slight. You can see that the position is already unbalanced with the first move. Unbalanced openings are less drawish since they allow chances for both sides and are risky.
55,2,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Garry has played the Dragon a couple of times but he mostly plays the Najdorf transposing into somehting of a Scheveningen  of sorts with ..e6. He also varies with ..e5 but not in most cases. The early ..a6 prevents the simplification move Bb5 and also prepares ..b5.
56,2,3,Bb7,b'rn2kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/P1N1B3/1PPQBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',..Bd7 is another popular option. Garry wants d7 for his knight later on when white will eventually push his pawn to g5 driving off the knight.
57,2,4,1O-O-O,b'r3kb1r/1bq2ppp/p1nppn2/1p6/3NP3/P1N1BP2/1PPQB1PP/2KR3R b kq -',Adams decides to play the English Attack. I personally along with many other top GM's use this system as my main weapon against the Najdorf. This is a strong system which consists of the same setup as the Yugoslav Attack against the Dragon. Here the pawn is placed on f3 to prevent ng4 harassing the bishop on e3. The bishop on e2 holds the f3 pawn in order to start the pawn storm g4 h5 etc. The pawn storm  does not only serve as an attack on he Black king. White wants to eventually push to g6 and remove the pawn from f7 softening e6 a key pawn in Black's chain. Black has some good chances as well. His attack can come from any moment and quite dangerously at that. We can safely say that the position is in some type of dynamic equality.
58,2,5,1b4,b'r3kb1r/1bq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/1p1NP3/P1N1BP2/1PPQB1PP/2KR3R w kq -',Opening the b-file for black. The b-file is a much better weapon for black than the c-file as it is harder to defend. Here both the b and c-files are wide open for Black's use. Kasparov utilizes this well.

62,2,9,O-O,b'1r3rk1/1bq1bppp/p2pp3/2n3PP/1n1NP3/2N1BP2/1PPQB3/1K1R3R w - -',Black castles later than usual. In most cases castling early is a priority. Sometimes it can be delayed until the moment when the king's safety is in jeopardy. Garry waits for that moment. He probably felt that White's pawn storm needed attention and rightfully so.
63,2,10,Bf6,b'1r3rk1/1bq2ppp/p2ppbP1/2n4P/1n1NP3/2N1BP2/1PPQB3/1K1R3R w - -',Black has his bishop on the long diagonal and at the same time he avoids the risky Dragon pawn structure which would make White's pawn storm even more dangerous.
64,2,11,Kxh7,b'br3r2/2q2ppk/p2pp3/2n1b1BP/1n1NP3/2N2P2/1PPQB3/1K4RR w - -',Black sees no threats following either gxf7 or gxh7. His king may look exposed but in actuality there is no immediate danger to his king and Garry knows that his attack is much stronger at the moment. Garry is a mighty calculator. Just because his situation looks threatening doesn't mean it is. Kasparov did not see any concrete threats in his calculations and so does not worry about his defenses. If 22.h6 ..g6 and Black's defenses hold. The king cannot be driven from h7 even with a rook sacrifice on g6. 
65,2,12,Nxc2,b'br3r2/2q2ppk/p2pp3/2n1b1BP/4P3/1NN2P2/1PnQB3/1K4RR w - -',! White would be ill-advised to take the knight. 23.Qxc2 or 23.Kxc2 ..Rxb3 and Black threatens among other things ..Bxc3 ..Rfb8 ..Qb6/a5 etc.

77,4,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Right. Black has opened his Queen up for both directions but the real threat is d5 to try and gain control of the centre.
78,4,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Develop.
79,4,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I'm glad he did this remember Rule #5? Bishop stronger than Knights in the endgame. Now Black probably really doesn't want to take my knight here. I wouldn't. This is a tactic to get me to push him away with my Queen-side pawns(4. a3  Ba5  5. b4 Bb6) which would force me to castle King-side having destroyed my Queen-side pawn structure  and giving his bishop an attack on f2. That is what I would do anyway. If he does take it he is breaking Rule #5 anyway so that will ultimately be to my advantage.
80,4,6,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Now if he takes my Knight here I can keep my pawn structure and my bishop will be in a position to attack Black on his King-side which at this stage is probably going to be the side he wants to castle on.
81,4,7,d5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq d6',Ok the pawn push. Now he is trying to control the centre. I can't take here as he has 2 pawns and his Queen on it so I will just push on.
82,4,8,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Now I have the ability to develop Nf3 and then possibly later on chase his queen with my bishop but not yet. Also because my pawn is now on e5 It has become somewhat of a priority for me. His Knight can only develop to two squares Nh6 which is very bad (Rule #3) or Ne7 which isn't much better. Ne7 means e will probably push the f7 pawn 1 or 2 squares on the next turn or castle. His alternative is to push the pawn 1 or 2 squares now. of course 2 squares and I En passen his ass.
83,4,9,h6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Well he is trying to preempt my bishop move but this is really a no meaning move. I have two pieces to his one developed so he really should be developing. If I had already brought my Nf3 then I would expect him to play it in response.
84,4,10,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I'm going to do it anyway. 3-1 in development.
85,4,11,a6,b'rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This was another no meaning move. What black is trying to do here is give his bishop a place to retreat to (Ba7) If/when I decide to chase him. Nothing to do with my f1 Bishop as I already cannot move beyond d3. Black is assuming that I am planning on castling King-side. Note: I prefer my opponent to castle first so that I can plan his demise.
86,4,12,Bd3,b'rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',4-1 in the development stage. Ready to castle king-side (only if I have to). Black is so far behind in development now it's gonna take a miracle for him to beat me at this stage.
87,4,13,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2ppP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"Mmmm. Let's see. If I take the pawn @c5 black gets what he wants in two moves instead of three
8. d4xc5   Bxc5 then he can retreat to a7 and give my f2 pawn pressure (no real meaning at the moment as he has nothing to back it up with).
But seeing as how I am vindictive I will make him work for it with...."

92,4,18,1Ne4,b'rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/b1P1P3/3pN3/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now black is getting into trouble. The big threat from white is Nd6 . If he does Bxd2  I take with my Queen and then I can castle either side.
93,4,19,1Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1n1p2p/b1P1P3/3pN3/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Don't know why he develops the Knight now as I can't take his Bishop with mine he has his Queen on it which would put me in check I would take with my Queen Queen-swap and I would have to take with my Knight which would be detrimental to my development. Best to push his Bishop away...
94,4,20,Bc7,b'r1bqk1nr/1pb2pp1/p1n1p2p/2P1P3/1P1pN3/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Ah I see. A double attack on my e5 pawn. He was thinking ahead but he wasn't looking from both sides of the board
95,4,21,1Nd6+,b'r1bqk1nr/1pb2pp1/p1nNp2p/2P1P3/1P1p4/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Time to disrupt. Black has two options move the King or do a swap. Either result is good for White. If he swaps Knight for Bishop good for me (rule #5) and I will have a passed pawn ( rule #9) and still be a point ahead.
96,4,22,1Kd7,b'r1bq2nr/1pbk1pp1/p1nNp2p/2P1P3/1P1p4/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Not what I would have done. I was looking to pick up his Bishop on c8 but he is throwing away his Rook on h8.....I just can't resist the temptation.
97,4,23,Qe7,b'r1b3nr/1pbkqNp1/p1n1p2p/2P1P3/1P1p4/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Better move for black would have been Qe8 effectively trapping my Knight after my next move. Instead he is allowing me to bring it back into play and attack his Queen.
98,4,24,1Nxh8,b'r1b3nN/1pbkq1p1/p1n1p2p/2P1P3/1P1p4/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Yummy!  7 with 4-3 development and a disrupted King. I can taste the victory already

Either way I'm not gonna stick around to find out especially when he keeps giving me forks to jump on
100,4,26,1Ng6,b'r1b3n1/1p1kq1p1/p1n1p1Np/2P1b3/1P1p4/P2B1N2/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Yummy!

102,4,28,1Nfxe5+,b'r1b1q1n1/1p1k2p1/p1n1p1Np/2P1N3/1P1p4/P2B4/2PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -', Danger Will Robins Danger!

I am attacking f7 looking for the Queen swap. This is to my advantage. Elimination is now my game (rule #7)
105,4,31,1Nf6,b'r1b1q3/1pk3p1/p3pn1p/2P1N3/1P1p4/P2B1Q2/2PB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Alright he seen it. but I have other options available.
106,4,32,1c6,b'r1b1q3/1pk3p1/p1P1pn1p/4N3/1P1p4/P2B1Q2/2PB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Like this. If we swap off I will still be  6 and I will castle King-side.
107,4,33,1Nd5,b'r1b1q3/1pk3p1/p1P1p2p/3nN3/1P1p4/P2B1Q2/2PB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Not what I was expecting. Let's chase his Queen around and see if he makes a mistake.

112,4,38,2Qxf4+,b'r1bq4/1pk2Np1/2P1p1Bp/p7/1P1p1Q2/P7/2P2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I would have taken the Queen but (Rule #16) there was a better alternative. Black cannot even put his Queen in front as it will still be free.
113,4,39,2e5,b'r1bq4/1pk2Np1/2P3Bp/p3p3/1P1p1Q2/P7/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now he is just giving me material.
114,4,40,Kb6,b'r1bq4/1p3Np1/1kP3Bp/p3Q3/1P1p4/P7/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Finally he does what he should have done on move 21.

131,5,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Usually my opponent wouldn't play this they usually go for Bc4 and try and set up for the four move mate or King's Gambit. I will see If I can find an example for you later.
132,5,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And now for some development (rule #2) As Black steal the advantage from white.
133,5,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I would say from here he wants to castle King-side but too early to tell for sure yet. Best to play it cool and keep developing.

138,5,9,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1p1p/2n1pnp1/2p5/2P1P3/2N3PB/PP1P1P1P/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I am going to set up for the Kings Indian Panno Variation.

But that means my Knight would have to move to h5 to back up the Bishop (Rule #3) bad for me. Instead I will avoid the confrontation for now and see what white plays
144,5,15,Ne5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/4pnp1/4n3/2PNP3/2N3PB/PP3P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Mmmm Yummy looking pawn @c4. Notice I attack toward the side I think he is most likely going to castle on

It can get hairy if he castles opposite and starts pushing pawns on my King-side but it is going to take a lot of moves before white can even attempt that.

My two wins so far have been relatively easy and I realize that this game will be for real. My opponent an actual adult is rated almost 100 points higher than me and I really need to beat him. I tell myself that since I have the white pieces I should play with purpose and go for the throat. My buddy who played this guy earlier and won tells me that I should stick with the Queen's Gambit. He seems to think that holds the most promise for me. I've been playing 1. Nf3 a lot lately with really good results and am hesitant to rock my own boat. Many times 1. Nf3 can transpose into QG lines but the Reti has been yielding me many good results over the last 4 months or so. I'm totally tortured as to what to open with. As my opponent and I shake hands I still don't know what to play. He hits the clock to start the game and I spend about 5 minutes on my first move. I'm finally reminded of the axiom my dad has said to me many times before - ""Dance with the one that brung ya"" and play 1. Nf3."

213,6,42,2Qd1,b'2q5/pr3r1k/3R2pp/5b2/1p6/6P1/PR3P1P/2BQ2K1 b - -',All right - opposite colored bishops and a wide open board. I give black the edge here as he has 2 to 1 pawns on the queenside and my bishop must be protected while it is still on c1.
214,6,43,2Rfd7,b'2q5/pr1r3k/3R2pp/5b2/1p6/6P1/PR3P1P/2BQ2K1 w - -',Encouraging a rook exchange which IMHO would only strengthen his 2-1 pawn advantage on the queenside.

217,6,46,3Rd2,b'2q5/pr5k/6pp/5b2/8/1p4P1/P2R1P1P/2BQ2K1 b - -',..... I just retreat to protect a2 and b2. My opponent is spending a lot of time in this position and after about 15 minutes I sense that I am not going to be able to hold him off if he plays a5. I offered him a draw only when I saw him shaking his head in frustration a few times as he attempted to clear his head and started re-calculating. He eventually declined and played.......
218,6,47,3Bc2,b'2q5/pr5k/6pp/8/8/1p4P1/P1bR1P1P/2BQ2K1 w - -',...which allowed me to play......
219,6,48,3Qe2,b'2q5/pr5k/6pp/8/8/1p4P1/P1bRQP1P/2B3K1 b - -',....which further reinforces the 2nd rank and c2 in particular. He can't play b2 as I take his bishop and if he then promotes I take his queen on c8 while still protecting my own bishop.
220,6,49,3Bd3,b'2q5/pr5k/6pp/8/8/1p1b2P1/P2RQP1P/2B3K1 w - -',Reopening the line against my bishop and forcing me back to d1.
221,6,50,bxa2,b'2q5/pr5k/6pp/8/8/3b2P1/p2R1P1P/2BQ2K1 w - -',He knows I'll take his bishop if he doesn't establish a new threat so he eliminates my last queenside pawn.
222,6,51,Qxc1,b'8/pr5k/6pp/8/8/3b2P1/R4P1P/2qQ2K1 w - -',?? Black folds and launches a speculative sac which I immediately identify as incorrect. He sees QxQ followed by Rb1 but fails to identify that I'll simply take his rook he takes back with his bishop then I take on a with a check tempo and a winning endgame.
223,6,52,3Qxc1,b'8/pr5k/6pp/8/8/3b2P1/R4P1P/2Q3K1 b - -',This game has taken my emotions from one end of the spectrum to the other. I was even then down then even then slightly better then in dire fear of losing then hoping for a draw then worse then clearly winning. Black continues with his faulty plan.
224,6,53,3Rxa7+,b'8/R6k/6pp/8/8/6P1/5P1P/1b4K1 b - -',My oh my how things have changed. A lapse in judgement by my opponent has yielded me a nice finish. I'd rather be lucky than good any day:) Black is now forced to the 8th rank and my pawns are going to stay on dark squares. Now it's just a matter of getting my king up the board.
225,6,54,3f4,b'6k1/R7/6pp/8/5P2/6P1/7P/1b4K1 b - f3',Now my king can start his journey on the dark squares.

227,6,56,4Kf6,b'5k2/R7/5Kp1/7p/5Pb1/6P1/7P/8 b - -',...and black resigned. What a major break I caught! As I write this I still can't believe it. I finish the 2007 Space City open with 3.5 points and as I record my result I notice that the young lady who I need to win as well still hasn't finished her game. I go over to take a look and her game looks pretty even to me with lots of pieces left on the board for both sides and plenty of time left. I force myself to walk away as not to jinx her and mill around outside with the other smokers for about an hour. Then the door opens and I see her emerge from the playing hall with a big smile. She confirms her win and we exchange high fives. We split the combined 2nd and 3rd place cash and each walked away with $150. Overall a really good feeling:) I hope you have enjoyed these games:) - Thomas
228,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As round three of the Space City Open begins I find myself with 1 point out of 2 and in the middle of the early pack. My opponent this round is a 12 year old kid who I am totally unfamiliar with. He is rated 1237 but has already taken down the #3 guy in the section (a 1512) so I can't take him for granted like I almost did with my last opponent. I vow not to lose this game. I want to end this first day of the tourney with at least an even score. He opens with the popular 1. e4.
229,7,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',After several tournaments of experimenting with the Caro Kann I decide to return to my old favorite the Scandanavian.

232,7,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Which he does.

234,7,6,Bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2B5/2ppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! White starts swinging first and trades bishop for knight. I was expecting something a little more developmental such as d4.

I'm considering ways to assault his king immediately as most of his pieces are over on the queenside. The problem is I just don't have enough ammo. I'm thinking Nf4 with possibly some help from h5. However I didn't correctly analyze my position after he played......

249,7,21,1Qxc1,b'r3kb1r/p4ppp/4p3/2pnP3/1p1pN3/1P1P4/PBP2PPP/R1q1R1K1 w kq -',As my queen was threatened she obviously had to move. I decide (once again somewhat foolishly) to remove the queens from the board - but this allows his DSB to get back into the action. I just did him a favor. I start to lose some confidence in my position as my DSB isn't really doing much.

Option #1 - BxB NxB 0-0 Ne4 and we are equal but his knight is better. Option #2 - Rc8 BxB KxB Nd6 and he is permanently posted deep in my territory. Option #3 - f6 exf gxf Nf6  and there are just too many threats near my king. Once again I go smoke and curse this game......
251,7,23,1Bxg5,b'r3k2r/p4ppp/4p3/2pnP1b1/1p1pN3/1P1P4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w kq -',I choose what I considered to be the lesser of three evils. I'm convinced white will wind up with the better position.
252,7,24,2a3,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/4p3/2pnP1N1/1p1p4/PP1P4/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?! Whoa....maybe he didn't see how strong Ne4 was.
253,7,25,2a5,b'r4rk1/5ppp/4p3/p1pnP1N1/1p1p4/PP1P4/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - a6',21. axb axb and I can hold the position.
254,7,26,2Ne4,b'r4rk1/5ppp/4p3/p1pnP3/1p1pN3/PP1P4/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White re-establishes the threat on c5 with this powerfully placed knight.
255,7,27,2Ra2,b'r1r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p1pnP3/1p1pN3/PP1P4/R1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',White plans to double down the a file forcing my c8 rook to a8 and winning my c pawn.
256,7,28,2a4,b'r1r3k1/5ppp/4p3/2pnP3/pp1pN3/PP1P4/R1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I attempt to confuse the issue. As my knight can't get to c3 without hurting my pawn structure I encourage him to take on b4 to get my knight to b4 and looking for targets.
257,7,29,2Rea1,b'r1r3k1/5ppp/4p3/2pnP3/pp1pN3/PP1P4/R1P2PPP/R5K1 b - -',White sticks with his plan.
258,7,30,2f5,b'r1r3k1/6pp/4p3/2pnPp2/pp1pN3/PP1P4/R1P2PPP/R5K1 w - f6',A gamble. If I can kick him out of e4 I may be able to get some offense going thereby slowing down his potential attack. I can handle him taking e.p. as gxf is protected and f5 would follow. 
259,7,31,2Nd6,b'r1r3k1/6pp/3Np3/2pnPp2/pp1p4/PP1P4/R1P2PPP/R5K1 b - -',White evades the danger and jumps on a nice post which threatens my rook.
260,7,32,2Nc3,b'r1r3k1/6pp/3Np3/2p1Pp2/pp1p4/PPnP4/R1P2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Once again I confuse the issue. I may end up dropping a pawn but I feel that I'll have some good counterplay.
261,7,33,2Nxc8,b'r1N3k1/6pp/4p3/2p1Pp2/pp1p4/PPnP4/R1P2PPP/R5K1 b - -',"White says ""OK - prove it to me."""

264,7,36,2g3,b'2r3k1/6pp/4p3/4Pp2/Pppp4/P2P2P1/R1P2P1P/6K1 b - -',White stops any ideas of a back row mate.

267,7,39,Rc3,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/4Pp2/P2p4/R1rP2P1/5P1P/6K1 w - -',I can now win back the pawn.
268,7,40,3f4,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/4Pp2/P2p1P2/3r2P1/7P/R5K1 b - f3',I think white is envisioning a board minus both rooks and both passers (which we eventually get) and strives for the better advancement.
269,7,41,3Kg2,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/4Pp2/P2p1P2/2r3P1/6KP/R7 b - -',Continuing his plan to be better placed after rooks and passers come off.
270,7,42,3Kh3,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/4Pp2/P2p1P2/6PK/2r4P/R7 b - -',With his king now safe white digs in his heels for a king and pawn endgame.
271,7,43,h6,b'6k1/6p1/P3p2p/4Pp2/5P2/6PK/r2p3P/3R4 w - -',It's obvious that his passer is not of any concern so I prep g5 as I really want to keep any chance of winning alive.
272,7,44,3Kh4,b'6k1/6p1/P3p2p/4Pp2/5P1K/6P1/r2p3P/3R4 b - -',White sees my idea and puts a stop to it immediately.
273,7,45,3g6,b'6k1/8/P3p1pp/4Pp2/5P1K/6P1/r2p3P/3R4 w - -',I made this move with the thought that under no circumstances am I going to lose this game. If worse comes to worse I'll simply barricade myself into a nice little box that he can't penetrate and we will draw. I'm really tired by this point and my brain is fried. I have visions of margaritas dancing in my head but put them aside as I challenge myself not to blow this game after all of this thinking.
274,7,46,3h3,b'6k1/8/P3p1pp/4Pp2/5P1K/6PP/r2p4/3R4 b - -',White keeps winning chances alive for himself and preps g4.
275,7,47,3Kf7,b'8/5k2/P3p1pp/4Pp2/5P1K/6PP/r2p4/3R4 w - -',Once rooks and passers go all I see is barricading myself in this corner.
276,7,48,Ke7,b'8/r3k3/4p1pp/4Pp2/5P1K/6PP/3R4/8 w - -',With hopes of removing the rooks.
277,7,49,4Rd4,b'8/r3k3/4p1pp/4Pp2/3R1P1K/6PP/8/8 b - -',! Nice move. Any hope I had of play against his f pawn is now mute. Little does he realize I'll be happy with a draw right now:)
278,7,50,4Rd7,b'8/3rk3/4p1pp/4Pp2/3R1P1K/6PP/8/8 w - -',And I offer him a draw.
279,7,51,4Ra4,b'8/3rk3/4p1pp/4Pp2/R4P1K/6PP/8/8 b - -',White declines and most likely sees play along my back rank.
280,7,52,4Kf7,b'8/3r1k2/4p1pp/4Pp2/R4P1K/6PP/8/8 w - -',Puposefully showing my intent to draw.

283,7,55,4Kh5,b'8/3r2k1/4p2p/4Pp1K/5P2/R6P/8/8 b - -',Looking to get his rook to g6 if I don't prevent it.
284,7,56,Rg7,b'8/6rk/4p2p/4Pp1K/5P2/6RP/8/8 w - -',I'll remove the rooks if he doesn't and if he plays along the 3rd rank I'll simply play Re7.
285,7,57,5Kh4,b'8/8/4p1kp/4Pp2/5P1K/7P/8/8 b - -',And I gladly accept his draw offer. Whew!....this little monster sure took a lot out of me. At the end of day #1 I'm sitting at 1.5/3. It's going to take a big day #2 to secure any prize money but by this time of the night I'm really not thinking too much about that. My favorite restaurant in Huntsville closes in an hour and half and my friend and I both are finally going to get those margaritas we have been thinking of all day:)
286,8,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Welcome to my latest OTB foray. The Space City Open in Huntsville AL is one of the oldest and most successful OTB tourneys here in the back waters of Alabama. I talked a buddy of mine into going with me and we both wound up with pretty good results - I finished tied for 2nd place with 3.5/5 and he  finished 3/5. Luckily for me we didn't play each other as he is the stronger player. It did feel good scoring more than him though:) Due to my rating I naturally get paired the first round with the highest rated guy in the U1600 section. He is 1592 and I sense trouble right off the bat. I played this guy a few months ago at another tourney and he destroyed me. I know that this game is gonna be tough. It may sound defeatist but I will be more than happy to get out of this one with a draw. I play sensibly for the first few moves IMHO but allow him to unleash a marauding knight into my back yard that I just can't deal with. He opens 1. d4.
287,8,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I generally try to steer into Indian defenses which have themes that I am comfortable with.
288,8,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nf3 may be a little more common but this also plays quite nicely. White knows Bb4 is coming so he develops on the queenside first to prevent the check. I tell myself that I'm probably going to trade bishop for knight on c3 and then get in b6 to aim the other bishop at what I presume will be his castled position.
289,8,3,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',White develops his queen to a strong diagonal while protecting his knight.
290,8,4,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq c6',?! I've played this line many times before with mixed results. Sure there was 4...BxN 5. QxB but I want to claim some space before I play Nc6 while eliminating one of his central pawns.
291,8,5,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2b5/2P5/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Good play - and the kind of move that I am usually hesitant to play. White restricts his DSB but immediately answers the question of f2 defense. White will now most likely play his DSB to its long diagonal.
292,8,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2b5/2P5/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',I sense the chance to lead in development and deploy this knight to a strong square.
293,8,7,a3,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2b5/2P5/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',!? This move tortured me and put me into a long think. Is white being paranoid about me attacking his queen with Nb4? or is he planning on b4 with tempo to open up the long diagonal for his DSB?
294,8,8,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/2b5/2P5/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',?! Thinking that I had the time to set up the queenside the way I wanted I play a6 to prep b5 and to create an escape square for my DSB as well as preparing my own fianchetto. I really should have gone ahead and castled here. I'll most definitely pay for that lapse in judgement very soon.
295,8,9,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/2b5/2P5/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',White takes his time and catches up in development.

297,8,11,cxd5,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bP4/8/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Of course as white can't allow me to play d4.
298,8,12,Nxd5,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2bn4/8/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',?! Mistake. I should have taken with my e pawn. Now white can dictate my next move.
299,8,13,1Nxd5,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2bN4/8/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Forcing my queen to retake to protect my DSB.

303,8,17,1b5,b'r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1nqp3/1pb5/2B5/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq b6',......a typical Thomas attack which is all bark and no bite. Thinking I could force the issue on the queenside I totally disvalued the strength of his next move.
304,8,18,1Rd1,b'r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1nqp3/1pb5/2B5/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',! Nice. White shows good patience and I'm sure starts thinking of winning my DSB.
305,8,19,1Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/p1n1p3/1pb5/2B5/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 w kq -',? I need help. The kind of help you get on a couch. The kind that requires pills every day. 13...Qe7 and I still had some play. Now I drop a piece.
306,8,20,1Bxb5,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/p1n1p3/1Bb5/8/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',! The best tactics are the simple ones.

308,8,22,1b4,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/2n1p3/2Q5/1p6/P3PN2/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 w kq -',I try to appear confident. I try to appear in charge and act as if I had all of this already worked out in my head. It's really hard to pull off this acting job with tears rolling down my cheeks. I threaten a weak tactic of my own.
309,8,23,1Nd4,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/2n1p3/2Q5/1p1N4/P3P3/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',! Strong. I can't take it - I can only support my Nc6.
310,8,24,1Nb5,b'r3k2r/1bq2ppp/2n1p3/1NQ5/1p6/P3P3/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',! Stronger. My weak 13th is punished yet again.
311,8,25,1Qe7,b'r3k2r/1b2qppp/2n1p3/1NQ5/1p6/P3P3/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 w kq -',This is where I should have put my queen back on  move 13. The end is very near.
312,8,26,1Nd6+,b'r3k2r/1b2qppp/2nNp3/2Q5/1p6/P3P3/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',! Strongest. I now officially hate all horses.
313,8,27,1Nxb7,b'r4k1r/1N2qppp/2n1p3/2Q5/1p6/P3P3/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',...and I throw in the towel. I hadn't properly noticed that this knight now protects his queen. I'm down a piece and a pawn and my Rh8 is worthless. White will have no problem cleaning up. As it is the first round I cut my losses and decide not to waste my energy. The only real consolation that I have is that Richard winds up winning the section with a score of 4.5/5 and it's my buddy who nicks him for a legit draw in the last round. I also tell myself that every remaining game that I have will be against easier opponents. Such is life. Now I make my worst move of the tournament and go to Cracker Barrel and load up on enough starch to guarantee that I will fall asleep during the second round. My buddy calls me an idiot and I agree........
314,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is the game that earned me the dubious distinction/accusation of being a ""Romantic"" player.  Now that I look back on it although it was wide-open it was still fairly sound throughout.  This is simply an example of the advantage of playing white.  If you want to attack you can.  I started with the most popular opening e4."
315,9,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The beginning of the Sicilian.
316,9,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a quick attacking setup that allows for early bishop pressure on the queen's pawn.
317,9,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',By advancing the queen's pawn this opens the possibility for an early check.
318,9,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Which I decide to make.
319,9,5,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It's either this or Nd7.
320,9,6,Bxd7+,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I force the issue rather than playing Nc3 or Na3.
321,9,7,Qxd7,b'rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Nxd7 restricts the queen; Qxd7 allows more freedom but also places the queen in front of the king.  With the white bishop gone this isn't as dangerous as it could be.
322,9,8,O-O,b'rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White and black are under-developed but there are interesting opportunities for attack.  The king is still vulnerable and the b7 pawn is potentially weak.
323,9,9,Nf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black wants to castle quickly.
324,9,10,e5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',But with the knight at f3 and no other support the early e-attack is available.  You don't see this often but it caused all sorts of chaos.
325,9,11,dxe5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/5n2/2p1p3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',The pawn capture is fairly safe but in this scenario it allows white to put immediate pressure on the queen.  Moving the knight might have been better.
326,9,12,Nxe5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White is quite under-developed but causing all amounts of grief for black.
327,9,13,Qc7,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',The only problem with this is that the queen is at least on the short-term being marginalized.
328,9,14,Re1,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Why move?  Bolster the knight and see how black responds.
329,9,15,e6,b'rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Nc6 might have been better
330,9,16,c4,b'rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq c3',Opening up the possibility for a queen check and beginning to establish center control.
331,9,17,Bd6,b'rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',This is smart.  Creates a strong queen-bishop line while simultaneously developing the board and attacking the pesky knight.
332,9,18,1Qa4+,b'rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/Q1P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',Hello!  I think she forgot about this possibility.  If you have a chance to halt the castle it can often cause great pain for the opponent.
333,9,19,1Nbd7,b'r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/Q1P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq -',All of black's mid-level pieces are out and the king can castle in either direction if need be.  But the attack is not necessarily over.

Apparently all the aggressive ""romantic"" play stressed black into a beginner's blunder.  Black immediately resigned.  She was quite flustered.  I was right there the night before.  I know how embarrassing such moves are.  In any event this was my first tournament win and certainly memorable.  

With the benefit of hindsight I have to admit my play was surprisingly aggressive.  As I recall at the time I was anxious to try e4 ... Nf3 ... Bb5 and this game set itself up for such an opening.  Such an aggressive opening seems to have been infectious to my later play.  

But for the bad queen move this position shows a modest advantage to white albeit with the advanced knight and advanced rook.  Black would do well to repel such attacks and slowly develop the pawns while hopefully forcing the advanced pieces out of position.  White and black are both without bishops so the game becomes more ""vertical.""  

This game could have easily ended in a draw."

431,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I have just begun a switch over to playing the open sicilian for a year or two I've played the closed I've had reasonable results but it always feels like I'm wussing out of the main lines.  So here's my first attempt to tear down the najdorf.  I recommend skipping to move 15 when we leave 'book.'  Enjoy!
432,14,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The move that defines the najdorf and leaves white with two types of choices.  Black will usually play ...e5 if given the chance and white may choose to allow that with common moves such as Be3 Be2 or f3 (which typically transposes into 6.Be3) or white can prevent black with 6.Bc4 forcing black to block the dangerous a2-g8 diagonal with 6... e6 and white can prevent ...e5 with 6.Bg5 which is the move featured in this game.
433,14,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now if 6... e5 black will have a horribly weak d5 square due to the pin on the f6 knight.
434,14,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',So black sensibly controls the d5 square.  6... Nbd7 is a reasonable alternative that also avoids the weak doubled pawns that would happen after a move like 6...h6?! 7.Bxf6!
435,14,4,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',White's plan is an aggresive pawn storm on the kingside while castling queenside.  At the same time though black can activate and has far better pawn structure in an endgame (as is the case in most sicilians the sveshnikov being a notable exception).
436,14,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A common line but one I was happy to see as white can very quickly begin a pawn storm.  Other moves include (but are not limited to) Gelfand's favorite 7... Nbd7 the infamous poisoned pawn that usually follows 7... Qb6 (the poisoned pawn is when black grabs b2) Polugaevsky's line with a risky 7... b5 7... Nc6 and the tricky 7... Qc7 where if white follows with a standard plan of Qf3 and 0-0-0 black starts a very quick attack by marching the b pawn.  But these are all main lines outside of this game.
437,14,6,Qf3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',The standard move ...b5 can now be met by e5! forking rook and knight and white is prepared to castle queenside (which puts the rook on the same file as the black queen.
438,14,7,Qc7,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',So the black queen leaves the file to a square where it can potentially stare down the white king on c1.

The plans are clear black will conclude development if he gets the chance with ...Bb7 and then use the c file with moves like ...Rc8 and ...b4 to pry it open.  White goes kingside black has not castled yet but white can also blast open the center if necessary with one of his three levers (e5 f5 and g5).  The main plan here is to get the bishop out of the way of the g pawn so white plays:
441,14,10,1g5,b'r1b1k2r/2qn1ppp/p2ppb2/1p4P1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R b kq -',And white advances his pawn with tempo gaining even more kingside space.  While white may be filled with holes in a potential endgame surely he has excellent play for the moment and excellently placed pieces.
442,14,11,1Be7,b'r1b1k2r/2qnbppp/p2pp3/1p4P1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R w kq -',12... Bxd4 doesn't promise much to black white will play 13.Rxd4 followed by Bh3 and pressure on e6.
443,14,12,1f5,b'r1b1k2r/2qnbppp/p2pp3/1p3PP1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R b kq -',This pawn sac is theory and by far the most powerful move in the position.  White has huge pressure on the weak e6 square.  Black has two choices defend e6 with 13... Nc5 or grab the pawn and survive the ensuing complications.
444,14,13,1Bxg5+,b'r1b1k2r/2qn1ppp/p2pp3/1p3Pb1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R w kq -',My opponent grabs.  A reasonable choice but he will have difficulty relieving pressure on e6.

447,14,16,1Be3,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/p2pp3/1p2nP1Q/3NP3/2N1b3/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R w kq -',And we have finally left book.  Black's move threatens to exchange white's knight but it draws the bishop away from defensive duties.  I've seen 15... Bf6 recommended and Q to e7 or d8 seem to be the most popular moves.  But why is 15... Be3 worse?  That was the question posed to me and I think it's because the bishop becomes a target for white's pieces my queen will not be on h5 forever and when it returns to e2 it will do so with gain of tempo.  Also a knight on d5 will fork queen and bishop (again winning tempo) how can I make that happen?
448,14,17,1Nxe6,b'r1b1k2r/2q2ppp/p2pN3/1p2nP1Q/4P3/2N1b3/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R b kq -',But of course!  The f7 pawn is pinned and I now win the d5 square.

453,14,22,1g6,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p2pP1p1/1pqNn2Q/4P3/4b2B/PPP4P/1K1R3R w - -',This is where we leave the GK database and I feel it's almost a decisive mistake.  The position is extremely sharp and now black has holes on both f6 and e7 for my knight to hop into.  While I don't have a dark squared bishop to attack the dark squares my excellently placed knight seems sufficient my queen is attack but I can retreat with tempo against the misplaced e3 bishop.  My pawn on e6 allows me to play e7 or weaken the g6 pawn exf7 .  Also due to the opening I don't have f or g pawns stopping my rooks from aiming directly at his king.  What's better?  I'm not sure.  19... fxe6 20.Bxe6 Kh8 has a few games in the database and the following positions favor white which throws doubt on the entire 15... Be3 idea.
454,14,23,2Qe2,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p2pP1p1/1pqNn3/4P3/4b2B/PPP1Q2P/1K1R3R b - -',I retreat with tempo slightly sad that 20.Nf6  Kg7 21.Qxh7  Kxf6 leads to nothing as his king can escape to e7 (or if I check on h4 back to g7).  But still I gain tempo on the bishop with the threat of e7 Rfe8 Nf6  picking up an exchange.
455,14,24,2Bg5,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p2pP1p1/1pqNn1b1/4P3/7B/PPP1Q2P/1K1R3R w - -',This defends both weak dark squares (f6 and e7) but lets me develop against his bishop while lining up on the king.
456,14,25,2Rhg1,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p2pP1p1/1pqNn1b1/4P3/7B/PPP1Q2P/1K1R2R1 b - -',Naturally.

Be3 the bishop has proved a target for my pieces once again it moves to an unprotected square and it vacates the g file leaving only a pawn in front of my rook (and one of the pawn's defenders: the f7 pawn can be easily removed).  I expected my opponent to try to hunker down with either 21... h6 or 21... f6 (even 21... Bd8 where it's at least not going to lose more tempo seems an improvement) but both moves leave his position with many holes.  Here's a sample line: 21... f6 22.Rxg5!? fxg5 23.e7 Rfe8 23.b4! Qc4 (a lot of squares allow knight forks) 24.Qxc4 Nxc4 25.Nc7! Rab8 (actually 25...Kf7 is fine for black this line doesn't quite work but even without this line working white's got a great position instead I should probably improve with a move like 22.e7 Rfe8 and the rook lift 23.Rg3 where it has great potential and Rc3 is a nice threat)) 26.Nxe8 Rxe8 27.Be6  Kg7 28.Bxc4 bxc4 29.Rxd6 with an easily winning endgame.  There are too many holes in black's game and without the dark squared bishop to defend my attack is simple.  Following this concept later in the attack there will be a crossroads and the correct continuation will be the one that gets rid of the dark squared bishop.

461,14,30,2Rxg6+,b'r2b1rk1/5n1p/p2p2R1/1pqN3Q/4P3/7B/PPP4P/1K1R4 b - -',! This move looked very powerful but I admit I did not see the followup yet- it's more of an auto-sac .  I had a bail out move in mind in case I couldn't find a clearly winning followup.  Knowing that after 24.Rxg6 ! hxg6 25.Qxg6  Kh8 that I'd at least have the move 26.Rg1 made me much more confident.  26.Rg1 forces 26... Qxg1  27.Qxg1 and there's no way I'm going to lose.  His pieces are awkwardly placed and I still have an excellent unchallenged knight on d5.
462,14,31,Kh8,b'r2b1r1k/5n2/p2p2Q1/1pqN4/4P3/7B/PPP4P/1K1R4 w - -',"Here is the moment of decision.  I think there are probably many roads to Rome in this position but some precision is required as I have sacrificed a full rook and the attack isn't as automatic as it might first appear.  I already mentioned that 26.Rg1 was my bail out move in case I couldn't find better but my main idea was 26.Bf5 so here goes the analysis:

26.Bf5 Ng5 is forced it defends h7 and threatens to give back an exchange to get rid of my attacking bishop 27.h4 seems the only logical way to continue as I don't see queen checks helping 27... Qf2 is probably best as black must secure the h file and he can afford to give back a little material (27... Rxf5 28.exf5 Nh7 29.Rg1 is probably good for white by 28.hxg5! is even stronger threatening to use the h file and black is absolutely hosed).  28.hxg5 Qh4 and after 29.Qxd6 Bxg5 there's still a game.

So how should white continue the attack?  Black's defense is based around holding the g5 square for just long enough to stave off my attack.  So I have to get rid of that control... with tempo if possible."
463,14,32,2Nf6,b'r2b1r1k/5n2/p2p1NQ1/1pq5/4P3/7B/PPP4P/1K1R4 b - -',26.Nf6!  Due to the eminent mate threat on h7 black has no choice but to take the knight.  While the d5 knight might seem a better piece than the bishop the bishop has far more influence on the kingside as the knight takes two moves to really enter the attack.  With the bishop gone black's defense falls apart.
464,14,33,Kg8,b'r4rk1/5n2/p2p1Q2/1pq5/4P3/7B/PPP4P/1K1R4 w - -',Obviously not 27... Kh7 which allows 28.Bf5 .
465,14,34,2Bf5,b'r4r1k/5n2/p2p2Q1/1pq2B2/4P3/8/PPP4P/1K1R4 b - -',Only now comes Bf5 and while 29... Ng5 is still forced it's no longer at all secure there.
466,14,35,2Ng5,b'r4r1k/8/p2p2Q1/1pq2Bn1/4P3/8/PPP4P/1K1R4 w - -',Actually 29... Qxf5 lasts longer but mate threats are still looming and even if black's not mated white's pawns are excellent.
467,14,36,3Qh6+,b'r4r1k/8/p2p3Q/1pq2Bn1/4P3/8/PPP4P/1K1R4 b - -',30.Qh6 !  A simple move but I should take the knight with check.  If 30.Qxg5 Rxf5 might make the game last another 20 moves.
468,14,37,Kf7,b'r4r2/5k2/p2p4/1pq2BQ1/4P3/8/PPP4P/1K1R4 w - -',If the king hides in the corner it's mate in two 31... Kh8 32.Qh6  Kg8 33.Qh7#.  But it's forced mate anyway.
469,14,38,3Qd7#,b'r2k1r2/3Q4/p2p4/1pq2B2/4P3/8/PPP4P/1K1R4 b - -',Why did this attack work?  The lines were drawn very early as white went forward with e4f4 and g4 while black pushed ...b5 but never got much activity.  It seems to me that even without the mistakes in the 7... Be7 line black is constantly on his heels.  The dubious move 15... Be3 put the bishop on a weak square.  19...g6 avoided an inferior endgame but allowed me to reposition with tempo.  21... Bh4 clearly lost time and made the attack flow easily.  His bishop may have been the key defensive piece to get rid of at the end of the combination but it was a useful target for most of the game.  The rook sac was automatic and it was 26.Nf6! that took me a long time to see though I was careful to keep a safe move in case I couldn't find a way to put black away.  This was a nice introduction to the najdorf for me though I think my record at this point is 1-2 in correspondence/otb games and 2.5-.5 in blitz.  I hope you enjoyed the attack and thanks for the game and conversation steverand67.

White's position is rather cramped as his b2-knight is unable to move for a while and there is no activity in white's camp.  Altough it must be said that white is still solid - I just thought during the game that I had somewhat failed the opening.

This bishop is merely sitting in a corner and doing nothing. 12.Nbd2 is more atractive as it prevents the black knight landing into c4. 12...Nxb3 is nothing to be afraid of because as I said this bishop hasn't got great value any more. Now black sees that he is better co-ordinated and goes for an attack.

Desperately for some activity he decides to recapture with the f-pawn to open the f-file which should act as a barrier for black to manoeuvre his heavy pieces to the kingside. This is a risky decision but not necessary a bad one

Alas posts do get deleted from the general forums after a while so I thought it was high time to annotate it here especially as I have recently played another game which involved a player promoting a pawn two moves before me which I will annotate as Jo's Great Escape Part 2.

613,22,3,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Ion stated here that he prefers 3.Nxd4 rather than the queen recapture even if it does mean the knight being moved twice. After 3.Qxd4 Black could have developed with gain of tempo by a timely ...Nc6 (though 3...Nc6 at once is met by 4.Bb5)
614,22,4,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Ion stated here - I would also criticise Black's 3...Qf6. You could have done better than to exchange at once on f6 with almost any developing move. Clearly Black wanted to exchange queens. Very well your queen is protected let him exchange in his time. E.g. 4.Nc3 (say) 4...Qxd4 5.Nxd4 and you have some threats coming up against the c7-square. 4...Nc6 won't help him much after 5.Bb5.
615,22,5,Bd2,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',8. Bd2 - over the last few moves we have been developing our pieces and both sides are now ready to castle.

ID however says ""Be3 instead of 0-0-0 looks fine covering the d4 square. I don't think myself that 0-0-0 was a bad move but it seems likely the preparatory Be3 might be a better. Not easy to spot since it had already moved a couple of moves ago. """

But sometimes it's worth looking at odd-ball moves. I would certainly look at 11.e5 here with the idea 11...dxe5 12.Bxg7 Rb8 13.Ba6... Yes this trades a centre pawn for a flank pawn - not usually a desirable bargain but here Black's Q-wing is broken up and White keeps the bishop-pair. Very hard to assess. 
Alternatively Black might play 11...Nxf3 12.exf6 Nxd2 13.fxg7 Rg8 14.Rxd2 Rxg7 15.g3... Black has the bishop for knight but there are plenty of pawns about and White's form the tidier set. Again not easy to assess. But one might consider either outcome at least as good as the game continuation... "

Try the unsubtle: 68...c5 69.Be7 c4 70.Bb4 Kf4 71.Kg7 Ke4 72.Kf6 Kd4 and I reckon White is busted: 73.Ke6 c3 74.Kd6 (74.Ba3 won't do: 74...Kc4 75.Kd6 b4 76.bc1 b3  /-) 74...Kc4 75.Ba3 b4  /-.

641,23,0,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! There is no reason to bring the queen out so early as there are no threats and no weaknesses in black's position.  Also it can allow black to advance his pieces while pushing your queen back as is seen in the game and finally it takes away the best square for the knight inhibiting your own development.
642,23,1,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',stopping Nd4 for now...  and now black takes charge in the center

So white has not really inhibited black from developing and this move highlights white's faulty opening setup swinging at ghosts.

White will usually try for a queenside attack while black will counter-attack on the kingside beginning with the ..f7-f5 thrust. White's attack is faster and simpler than black's. However black's attack is more dangerous because it is directed right at white's king. Thus there are chances for both sides.

The obvious - I need the full point to have any chance to cash; the other reason is that this kid yesterday exhibited some of the worse sportsmanship I've ever seen at a chess tournament. Some of the things that came out of this kids mouth were just shameful - especially comments directed towards opponents he had beaten (he was 2/3 entering round 4). I won't go into specifics but suffice it to say that every player in the Reserve section was rooting for me. This kid needed to be put down hard and I was just ornery enough on this morning to do it. He drops a rook early and I tell myself that if given the opportunity I will give him a taste of his own medicine. Call me insensitive - or a bad guy - if you like but circumstances dictated that I crush him to teach him a lesson. While I take no real pride in the quality of the game it was satisfying to put him in his place. White opens with 1. e4.

One of the intersting things about the Scandinavian is that white usually can gain a developmental edge but black can neutralize it quite easily with correct play and just sit back and wait him out.

764,26,10,1Qd3,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/1qp5/8/5B2/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq -',White is apparently seeking a quick knockout down the d file but he will come up short as blacks developmental catch up protects his vulnerable squares.

770,26,16,1Qd5,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/N4B2/1PPQ2P1/P4P1P/3RKB1R w Kkq -',d5 is such a sexy square in the Scandinavian Defense. Blacks queen and both knights have access to it rather quickly and here I utilize it to force an exchange of queens.

Three people offer to buy me beer. I forget about this game quickly and avoid talking about my opponent although several other players are obviously pleased. I however have other things to consider. To my pleasant surprise I now calculate that if I can win round 5 and another player wins her game she and I will tie for 2nd place and we will split $300. We chat for a bit wish each other luck and prepare for the last round. She studies an opening book. I smoke cigarettes:)"
796,27,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As the second round of the Space City Open begins I find myself looking at the wall chart and being traumatized when I see the last name of my next opponent. I am feeling fat and bloated from my pig out experience at Cracker Barrel and the last thing in the world I want is to play this kid. He is 10 and definitely on his way up the ratings chart. Then I look a little closer and realize that it's not the wunderkind but his father that I am playing. Matt is the VP of the Alabama Chess Federation and a very cool guy but he is a beginner who only really got into competetive play because of his kid. As is typical in a Swiss tourney I go from playing the highest rated player in round one to the lowest rated player in round two. I open with 1. Nf3.
797,27,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An interesting choice for a beginner. Let's see if he can handle a transposition.
798,27,2,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I see an opportunity to get into my pet QG lines (which constitute 80 % of my rated games with the white pieces). 
799,27,3,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',I put my mind into full Queens gambit mode. I feel secure whether he takes or not.
800,27,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',! I'm gonna give Matt full credit here for not being enticed by the apparent low hanging fruit. Most beginners snap off the c pawn quick. Black opts for a traditional QGD line.
801,27,5,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I feel confident in saying that I play this move 100% of the time. The exchange variation of the QGD is my all time favorite. At this point I intend to play Rc1 as soon as possible and start raising Cain on the c file.
802,27,6,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Regaining equality.

804,27,8,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I seriously considered Qa4  which I normally play against weaker players. But I realized that black has not been intimidated by me at all so far and God forbid may actually have some game. I reigned in my ego and played a logical developing move which established a nice pin.
805,27,9,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Not bad but not great IMHO. Bf5 seems to hold more promise.

I remind myself that over-confidence has taken down players far better than I and that I should now double my efforts and start playing chess. No one is gonna just give me a point.
807,27,11,h3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/1b1P2b1/2N1PN1P/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',!? I set the first trap. If he takes I'll retake with my queen and have possibilities on f6. I know that developing my LSB is more logical but I just had the feeling that my opponent was having problems keeping up with the consequences of the three pins on the board. His eyes and body language told me that he wanted to keep things as simple as possible so I put him to the test.
808,27,12,Bxf3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1Pb1P/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',?! My gut feeling turned out to be right. Black tries to maintain some degree of tempo but in the process allows me my wish.

We both had a good laugh at how reckless my 24. g4 was (I think he laughed harder than I did:) While obviously happy with the full point I was somewhat disappointed with my game. I really should have put this one away far sooner I felt. I tell myself not to dwell on it and start poring over the wall chart once again to see how things are shaping up. The field is 14 players large and I'm #6 on the ratings list. I still have three tough games to go if I want to cash in this tourney. I really shouldn't be thinking about the margaritas I'll be drinking later tonight but I'm really craving some alcohol induced relaxation. I pace nervously and smoke cigarettes waiting for round three.......

At this point I had been playing on Gameknot for about 2 years and felt ready to try my hand at ""real world"" chess.  The tournament was the 4th George Washington Open held in Springfield Virginia.  As is typical in open play my first round Friday night game was against a relatively highly rated player.  

Playing black I set up my board and clock and anxiously awaited the start.  When the start was announced my opponent wasn't there!  I started my clock and waited.  He must have been stuck in traffic as he showed up and quickly played d4.

Even though I'm in my mid-thirties I was incredibly nervous about this first tournament experience."

934,29,57,2Kg7,b'8/1np3k1/1p1p1p2/pN1PpBn1/1PP1P3/P7/2K2PP1/8 w - -',I have no idea why I thought it would be helpful to advance the king up the h-file.  Desperation?  I now realize that this wasn't yet a clear win for white.
935,29,58,3Nxc7,b'8/1nN3k1/1p1p1p2/p2PpBn1/1PP1P3/P7/2K2PP1/8 b - -',White takes his pawn.
936,29,59,3Kh6,b'8/1nN5/1p1p1p1k/p2PpBn1/1PP1P3/P7/2K2PP1/8 w - -',The king takes a walk in the park while the empire crumbles.

942,29,65,3Kh4,b'8/1n6/1p1p1N2/3PpBn1/1PP1P2k/8/2K2PP1/8 w - -',This shows off a good endgame note.  Side-by-side pawns are a great king blocker.  They take up huge space as far as the slow king is concerned.  Even though white didn't force the issue I walked right into a wall.
943,29,66,3g3#,b'8/1n6/1p1p1N2/3PpBn1/1PP1P2k/6P1/2K2P2/8 b - -',I really didn't have a deathwish here but that's exactly what I did.  At this point I certainly hadn't studied much about the endgame.  The one brightside at least I made such goofball mistakes against a relatively highly rated player.
944,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a game between my Dad and me to prepare for the 4th George Washington Open June 15-17 2007.  I think we agreed to a gentlemanly draw in the end though I probably deserved to lose.  I open with e4.  At that time e4 was scary territory for me (and still is to some extent).  e4 tends to lead to a wide-open game which is exciting but also nerve-wracking.
945,30,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Looks like the Sicilian.
946,30,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This particular opening sets up for an early castle and uses bishop pressure on the king.  Based on the GK database this opening appears to do well against the Sicilian.
947,30,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Pretty standard but this favors white at this point.

950,30,6,Bxc6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2B5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Absolutely no pressure to capture here.  Yet somewhat surprisingly according to the GK database this capture still favors white.
951,30,7,Qxc6,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Stacking pawns is usually not good so this makes sense.
952,30,8,d3,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',One can immediately castle or develop at this point.

959,30,15,h6,b'r1b1k2r/pp1pbpp1/2q1pn1p/2p3B1/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I tend to do this myself.  Why invite trouble from the bishop?  This weakens the castle but it's almost a necessity at some point.

966,30,22,1Rb1,b'r1b2rk1/p2pbppn/1pq1p2p/2p1P3/2P5/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',Probably a wasted move on my part.  I used to do this out of habit but have since learned it shouldn't be done without reason.  Although this sets up a b-file attack in this case such attack isn't really ripe.  This essentially gives black a chance to defend himself.

Well this was one of my worst draw offers in Gameknot history.  The only think I can say in mitigation that it was near the end of my Big Slump which happened fairly early on in my gameknot career which saw my rating go down to 1525 - I just wanted to end a losing run so I took a low draw - I was that desperate man!  Thankfully a few months later after playing 2 months of unrated games non-stop I was on the up.  But here is the pits.

Black could have saved his piece only by this wriggle: 23...c6 24.dxe5 Qa7ch 25.Kh1 Bb8 (...Bc7 looks too risky after Rd7).

I'm not sure of the exact continuation from here but White's next three moves are 7. O-O 8. Ne2 9. Qa4 eventually winning the bishop.  I established a strong position and then lost the game later by moving e5 unblocking the bishop.  Game was eventually called a draw about seven moves later after Will failed to find the mate.

1207,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game black (me) obtains major control of the game with a 7 or 8 point material advantage but the moral of the story never give up!  Black makes a really really bad move at 24 and allows white to knight fork its queen.  After that things turned decidedly in white's favor.  White does an excellent job of executing the endgame.  White starts with the popular e4.
1208,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black sets up the Sicilian which is often an aggressive counter-attack.

1212,39,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Which I exercise immediately.  Obviously white can respond with cxd4 to balance out the trade or place the queen in the middle of the board.  Some like this for white but I think it can be a weakness as it gives black a big target and an opportunity to chase the queen and develop at the same time.
1213,39,6,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White plays it safe.
