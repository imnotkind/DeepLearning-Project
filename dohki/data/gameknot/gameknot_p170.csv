Here he protects the d5 square which is under pressure from White's e-pawn and bishop. The knight can also go to c4 which is a strategic aim in the Sicilian. There is a subtle reason which we shall see in a few moves. The knight uncovers the bishop at c8 which is ready to develop a typical Petrosian's method of simple development.

The pawn at e5 occupies the centre supported by the d6 pawn thus stopping any central breakthrough and also attacks the White knight on d4. This move creates a hole on d5 which shall be exploited by White but Boleslavesky showed that this weakness can be managed. 
160,8,4,Bxf5,b'r3r1k1/1pq1bppp/pn3n2/4pbB1/4P3/2N2BQ1/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',Petrosian exchanges his bishop for knight. Black's knight move to b6 allowed these central exchanges and the hole at d6 is no longer existing.

His strategy of exchanging attacking pieces and accumulating small advantages has paid off. Tal has had enough of this prophylactic treatment and does not want to play the endgame. So Tal resigns. We may remember this lesson from Petrosian when we are faced with an attack.

Your black B is nicely placed on his K diagonal and b6 allows b4 chasing your B away (while b3 could have been a fall-back square). Also with the threat of Bf3 (which was why we must assume he moved his N to such a lousy place) your Q would have to move and b6 unprotects your N as well. Yes it would have been nice to fianchetto but your B was already well placed attacking his h-pawn.

It highlights the secondary reason why it's bad to move the Q out early and that is frequently it can be trapped with so many pieces still on the board. The primary reason masters practically NEVER bring a Q out early is that it allows the opponent to just threaten the Q continually with minor pieces and pawns thereby developing his position while the Q is forced to run around. Anytime your opponent brings out his Q look to do just that--attack his Q while  developing--and also look to trap his Lady. Sometimes you'll note he has only 2 or 3 squares to go to and you can deploy a piece to cover those squares before he realizes he's in trouble (that is sometimes you have to plan and ""create"" the trap!)."

YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THOSE as you could easily have lost the B. Note that it is also a nice trap and I've done it deliberately many times (that is allow your opponent to have one more attacker than defender on a piece and then when he takes it with a B or N you pin it and win it--it happens all the time!).
205,11,9,1Bf1,b'r2r2k1/p1pqbppp/1pn2n2/8/1PP1p3/PQ1bB2P/5PPN/R2R1BK1 b - -',I don't understand this. f3 had more potential to give you problems...

207,11,11,2Qxd3,b'r5k1/p1p1bppp/1pn1qn2/8/1PP5/P2QB2P/5PPN/R5K1 b - -',Note the position here. Aside from being a piece up you have 4 pieces developed he basically has 2 (as the N is so far out of position). This SIGNIFICANTLY weakens his offensive and defensive capabilities so 2 things come to mind. Try to take advantage of this quickly (like a hockey game power play when the opponents are one man short) and also try to keep the N in the bad place if you can (sometimes putting a B on the diagonal he can move to works or sometimes you just have to advance one pawn and he's stuck). This annotation is a lesson in occasionally studying the strategic not tactical position. Also though it's not a factor here--as the pawn structure is OK for both--but strategic assessments usually focus more on pawn structures (i.e. taking advantage of--or creating!--isolanis doubled pawns or passed pawns).
208,11,12,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/p1p1bppp/1pn1qn2/8/1PP5/P2QB2P/5PPN/R5K1 w - -',Good. Develop and attack simultaneously.
209,11,13,2Qc3,b'3r2k1/p1p1bppp/1pn1qn2/8/1PP5/P1Q1B2P/5PPN/R5K1 b - -',Another strategic note here... his black B is wonderfully placed; yours not as well so. His black B is therefore worth more so to speak. Thus Ne4 (harrying his Q which is usually a good thing to do) followed by Bg5 would allow you to chase his black B away from its nice perch or to exchange it. Note that an exchange is in your favor as his B was better placed. You can think of the exchange as worth maybe a tenth of a point in your favor. All these tenths of a point (like creating an opponent's isolani or doubled P or exchanging a c/f  P for a d/e P) add up and frequently decide a game (especially in master play).
210,11,14,2Nh5,b'3r2k1/p1p1bppp/1pn1q3/7n/1PP5/P1Q1B2P/5PPN/R5K1 w - -',Sometimes it's necessary but as a general rule try NOT to put your N on the edge of the board if you can at all help it or unless it gives you some advantage QUICKLY. Note that a N on the edge only has 4 squares to move to while when it's centralized it has 8 possible squares. Thus a N on the edge is literally HALF as powerful! Another real danger is that if your opponent puts a Bishop 3 squares straight out from the N (e5 here) then the N can never move (unless otherwise protected). This is frequently a big factor--and a trap--in end games (when the N has nothing else to protect it).
211,11,15,2Re1,b'3r2k1/p1p1bppp/1pn1q3/7n/1PP5/P1Q1B2P/5PPN/4R1K1 b - -',Good. Do this whenever you can (i.e. putting a R on the Q-file) as it almost always gives your opponent problems.

1.  Try NEVER to move your Q ""INTO"" a pin!!!  With this move he can move his black B anywhere for FREE and do ANYTHING as you're forced to move your Q in reply. The most dangerous result is he gives a check and you lose your Q; 2d worst is he takes a major piece for free; 3rd worst is he gobbles up something else (here he can win your b and a pawns).
2.  Qg6 would have saved your N."

You had 4 nice offensive moves: RxP Nf3+ NxP and the beautiful triple-fork at Nd3 but they all seem to have problems with a back-rank mate (or cost you a piece). So f6 was a good defensive reply. It's not great as it gives you an isolani but it does have 3 advantages: 1) it gives the K an escape square; 2) it allows your Q to protect e8; and 3) it removes his B from protecting his N (which could/should become significant later as you should eventually take his RP).
218,11,22,3Bxe5,b'6k1/p1p3pp/1p1b1p2/1P2B2q/2P5/r6P/1Q3P1N/4R1K1 b - -',Correct. Your N was VERY powerful where it was so this exchange was maybe worth a quarter-point for him.
219,11,23,3c5,b'6k1/p1p3pp/1p1b4/1PP1p2q/8/r6P/1Q3P1N/4R1K1 b - -',"A missed opportunity here perhaps. Instead of BxP next better here might have been RxP (threatening RxN and then Rh1+ and Qh3#). If he takes the B now then after RxN he is in serious danger of being mated so he is therefore ""likely"" to move his f-pawn probably to f4 I'd think (note that he can't move the N either without getting mated). This then allows:
33.	f4	Bxc5+
34.	Kh1	Qf3+
35.	Qg2	Qxg2+
36.	Kxg2	Rb3  (wins another pawn)
37.	fxe5	Rxb5
38.	e6	Be7
... and now with 3 connected passed pawns you have an easy win. I said ""likely"" above because there is one better continuation for him (but a player at his level could easily not find it): Qb3+ and then Qd5. So RxP isn't a guaranteed win but it was a very good chance. As a minimum--at no loss of material--it eliminates two pieces in front of his K and gives you current and future mating chances."

     Now that I look at it a bit longer another possibility is a rook sac: RxN KxR and then Bd6 locks his R in place. If he tries to check you with his Q he'll lose the R outright. His best move (which he may not find) seems to be f4 and then you win the exchange back. Then after Qe5+ you can win his e-pawn and then it's 5 pawns for you to 1 one pawn for him. Unfortunately if he plays right he can win your c and then a pawns but that's a big ""if"" and you'd still have a pretty straight forward win. I think I like the first option above better. The 2d clears all the minor pieces--something you want to do when you're 3 pawns up--but the 1st choice should simply win the exchange and then you're 5 points ahead."

It's not enough to analyze the board where the pieces are you ALSO have to analyze the board where the pieces WILL BE after every possible check or attack on your Q or discovered attack etc.  In particular you have to look at every possible ""check"" coming up so this was really foreseeable.
    ""More better"" here much mo' better actually would have been Qe1+ and then Qe4 pinning and forcing a trade of Q's--a VERY good thing for you.

Blacks Knight and pawn on e5 exert pressure on the d4 square. Blacks dark squared bishop also exerts latent pressure on this square. However white is exerting pressure of his own on the d5 square with his flanking pawn on c4 his knight on c3 and his bishop on g2. There is also nothing stopping him from taking this square by placing his d pawn on d5 driving the c6 knight away. This is the move he plays next.

Perhaps with a5 first to stop white forcing the knight to retreat. This would give the knight control of b3 and a4 keeping the queen of those squares. Polgar's move might have been chosen to get the knight to a6 via the c7 square. It might also have been to get the knight to d4 after cxd5 cxd5. But only if the queen was no longer covering that square. The knight move might also be to guard against white playing c5. Which might lead to a pawn advancing to d6. (9...Ne8 10. c5 cxd5 11. cxd5 b6 12. cxd6 Nxd6) 
Another reason for the two knight moves would be to move the f6 knight so black can begin a kingside attack with the advance of the f7 pawn to f5"

Lagraves move stops the a - pawns advance and prevents the b - pawn going to the b4 square. Polgar wants to move the knight to play f5 we probably should be trying to start a kingside attack. In this fianchetto variation it seems that white is going after the queen side and we should be going after the kingside. I'm not sure we should have played c6 earlier. If you consider the direction of the pawns ours are pointing kingside. We probably should have gone with Polgar's move. "

The pawns on d6 and b7 are potential problems. Qd7 keeps the knight away from b5 and prevents the white queen going to a4 unless white wants to exchange it. He can however still move it to b3 to attack the b-pawn. I think maybe Ne8 would have been better since we need to begin attacking the kingside with the pawn advance f7-f5.

One of the greatest lessons I've taken out of playing this knight sacrifice the Perenyi is to forget about the supposed ""piece values"" (e.g. knight ~ 3 rook ~5).

447,21,5,h3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3NP3/2NBB2P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',white is decisively not agressive. I was supposed to be the favorite of this game. This may explain. But at that level of the game I said to myself: come first I want to draw here and win with white. (actually I lost with white...)

563,24,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',When Reti popularized the hyper-modern opening named after him (1 Nf3) he had some profound positional concepts in mind such as controlling the center from the wings instead of attacking it with pawns. But when confronted with such admirable tacticians as Dr. Treybal the game became as wild as anything arising out of the King's Gambit.

574,25,2,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Note that Black's pawn on e5 was still en prise. White could have taken it with the knight with little worry but castling was his first mistake.
575,25,3,dxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/4p3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This move forks White's bishop and knight as Black's pawn is backed up by the knight on f6.

577,25,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/1B2p3/4p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',White must once again choose which piece to save.
578,25,6,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/4p2N/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black could have won White's knight with 7. ... g5 but he still succeeds anyway.
579,25,7,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/4p2N/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Mistake number two. White could have defended the knight with 8. ... g3.
580,25,8,g3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/4p2q/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White plays the move too late.
581,25,9,Qh6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n4q/3np3/4p3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Black can't save both the queen and the pawn on e4 at once.
582,25,10,Bf5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2n3q1/3npb2/4R3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNBQ2K1 w kq -',Black's position is now very dominating.
583,25,11,1Ra6,b'r3kb1r/p4ppp/R1n3q1/1p1npb2/8/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNBQ2K1 b kq -',White's third mistake. The rook can now be trapped.
584,25,12,1bxa3,b'r3k2r/p1n2ppp/2n3q1/1p2pb2/8/P2P2P1/P1P2P1P/RNBQ2K1 b kq -',At this point one has to wonder how in the world could Black stuff things up.
585,25,13,1Bf4,b'r3k2r/p1n2ppp/2n2q2/1p3b2/2P1pB2/P2P2P1/P4P1P/RN1Q2K1 b kq -',Mistake number four by White. His rook is en prise due to Black's previous pawn push. Black needn't waste time on defending the knight.
586,25,14,exd3,b'r3k2r/p1B2ppp/2n5/1p3b2/2P5/P2p2P1/P4P1P/qN1Q2K1 w kq -',Black wins a pawn and also places one of his own deep into White's territory. The pawn is immune to capture by the White queen since it's backed up by the bishop.
587,25,15,2cxb5,b'r3k2r/p1B2ppp/2n1b3/1P6/8/P2p2P1/P4P1P/qN2Q1K1 b kq -',White makes up for the previous pawn loss but his resulting pawn position is not quite as powerful as Black's. However though it may not look like it this is the pawn that will later give Black tremendous fear.
588,25,16,2Rc8,b'2r1k2r/p1B2ppp/2n1b3/1P6/8/P2p2P1/P4P1P/qN2Q1K1 w k -',Black favours attacking the bishop over saving the knight. However White doesn't comply with his plan.
589,25,17,2c7,b'4k2r/p1P2ppp/3rb3/8/8/P2p2P1/P4P1P/qN2Q1K1 b k -',This is the critical moment. White has a pawn on its way to promotion but it can be easily stopped. Black on the other hand is as oblivious as ever. Note that Black's bishop is pinned. It can't move as that would place the Black king in check.
590,25,18,2d2,b'4k2r/p1P2ppp/3rb3/8/8/P5P1/P2p1P1P/qN2Q1K1 w k -',This looks pretty alright for Black as he presumes that he'll get another queen too.
591,25,19,2c8=Q+,b'2Q1k2r/p4ppp/3rb3/8/8/P5P1/P2p1P1P/qN2Q1K1 b k -',And now Black's troubles begin. He thought that he would be able take White's new queen but failed to appreciate the pin placed on the bishop. This would still not be so bad if the move didn't place Black's king in check but that is not the case.
592,25,20,2Qc6+,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/2Q1b3/8/8/P5P1/P2p1P1P/qN2Q1K1 b k -',For a great deal of time White simply harasses the Black king.
593,25,21,2Qd1,b'4k2r/p2r1ppp/4b3/8/1Q6/P5P1/P2p1P1P/qN1Q2K1 b - -',This is Black's chance. He has to do something that will let him stay in the game.
594,25,22,2Bxa2,b'4k2r/p2r1ppp/8/8/1Q6/P5P1/b2p1P1P/qN1Q2K1 w - -',This looks like a wasted opportunity but pressure is now building up around White's knight. Note that Black still has the pawn on d2.
595,25,23,2Qe2+,b'4k2r/p2r1ppp/8/8/1Q6/P5P1/b2pQP1P/qN4K1 b - -',White now resumes his harassment of Black's king.
596,25,24,3Qab5,b'4k2r/p2r1ppp/4b3/1Q6/8/P5P1/3pQP1P/qN4K1 b - -',Another break in White's series of checks. Black can now try to get something underway. It is of high interest that Black hasn't simply resigned. He has two rooks in place of an extra queen though one of his rooks is tucked away on h8 doing nothing.
597,25,25,Ke7,b'1Q5r/p2rkppp/4b3/8/8/P5P1/3pQP1P/qN4K1 w - -',Black no doubt longs for White to capture the exposed rook on h8 as he can then play 34. ... Qxb1+ or 34. ... d1=Q+ or even 34. ... d1=R+ since he would threaten so much. However Black has forseen this and decides against taking the rook.
598,25,26,Rd6,b'7r/p3kppp/3rb3/8/1Q6/P5P1/3pQP1P/qN4K1 w - -',Black's hopes of glory are now wiped away. The rook in addition to the bishop is pinned against the Black king and the pawn on d2 is now open to capture.
599,25,27,Qxb1+,b'7r/p3kppp/3rb3/8/1Q6/P5P1/3Q1P1P/1q4K1 w - -',What in the world? Black has just sacrificed his queen. Interestingly this move is pretty solid as after 36. Qxb1 Rxd2 Black has two rooks and a bishop against a queen which is pretty good.
600,25,28,3Kg2,b'7r/p3kppp/3rb3/8/1Q6/P5P1/3Q1PKP/1q6 b - -',Making a move even more amazing than the last White rejects the sacrifice.
601,25,29,3Bd5+,b'7r/p3kppp/3r4/3b4/1Q6/P5P1/3Q1PKP/1q6 w - -',Black now takes action. It is his turn to harass his opponent's king. This looks fine but in reality Black's bishop is open to capture by White's queen on d2 as the rook is pinned. However White fails to appreciate that.
602,25,30,Bxf3+,b'7r/p3kppp/3r4/8/1Q6/P4bP1/3Q2KP/1q6 w - -',Black is very daring. Sacrificing his bishop this move looks like insanity but in truth Black gains an advantage in attack.
603,25,31,4Kh4,b'7r/p3kpp1/3r4/7p/1Q5K/P5P1/3Q3P/5q2 b - -',White's king must be starting to feel quite unsafe.
604,25,32,Rhd8,b'3r4/p3kpp1/3r4/5q1p/1Q6/P5P1/3Q2KP/8 w - -',With this Black defends against White capturing the rook on d6.
605,25,33,4Qxa7,b'3r1k2/Q4pp1/3r4/5q1p/1Q6/P5P1/6KP/8 b - -',White goes for a petty pawn grab which in all honesty is probably his undoing.
606,25,34,4Kg8,b'3r2k1/Q4pp1/3r4/5q1p/1Q6/P5P1/6KP/8 w - -',A very good move by Black as his rook on d6 is no longer pinned to the king.
607,25,35,4Qac5,b'3r2k1/5pp1/3r4/2Q2q1p/1Q6/P5P1/6KP/8 b - -',And after all that this is White's fifth and final mistake.
608,25,36,Rd8d2+,b'6k1/5pp1/8/2Q2q1p/1Q6/P5P1/3r2KP/3r4 w - -',Black now has two options but both of them lead to ruin.
609,25,37,Qb1+,b'6k1/5pp1/8/2Q4p/8/P5P1/3r3P/1q4K1 w - -',Black now forces White's next move.
610,25,38,Qxc1#,b'6k1/5pp1/8/7p/8/P5P1/3r3P/2q3K1 w - -',A beautiful game not just in the moves but in the astonishment it conjures up as well. Black was essentially down a queen but still won with White giving up both of his queens to prolong checkmate. And curiously it all happened in exactly fifty moves. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game or want to leave me feedback please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.

636,26,25,2Be2,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/4pn2/4Q3/5P2/6P1/2PKB1qP/r2R3R b - -',Rc3 would expose the king to the knight and loses the bishop.

It has been quite a while since I have annotated a game although I have been away on holiday for the best part of August and it has taken me a little while to get back into the swing of things.  However I am pleased to report a good win with the white pieces in the Master Mater's Annotation's Project Part 3.  I will now give you the Gameknot Analysis link to enable you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14263663&rnd=0.8295382966212421.  I will then begin my commentary on Move 8."

The other alternatives are Kd6 (not good because it does expose the BK on the open d column) and Ke1 which could allow repetition.  Black must be careful after white whips off the black knight because my steed on g5 threatens to deliver a Royal Fork on e6.
757,32,3,1Ne6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',10. Ne6 - this knight move is designed to make life very awkward for black to develop his pieces.  After this quick development on the part of white is required in order to go for the jugular in this case the BK.

765,32,11,Ka6,b'3br2r/p5pp/kp1N4/2p1B3/5pB1/P2P4/2P3PP/R4RK1 w - -',24. ..... Ka6 - this move allows #4 and I announced it to my opponent after playing my next move 25. Bc8+.  Julian was given the option of resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate and he took it.  I will not give the moves that result in the checkmate but you could send me an e-mail and I will let you know if the answer is correct.  It is good to weave a mating net around the enemy king especially late in the game sans Glenda.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne

850,35,30,f4,b'8/5N1p/p1k1p1p1/P1p1P3/2K2p1P/8/8/8 w - -',"The game is drawn because white must stop the f pawn from promoting. That requires either the white king to give way (allowing black's king to take the a5 pawn and promote his a pawn) or the knight to stay rooted on the kingside where he can't help his king make a breakthrough. For instance 35. Ng5 h6 36. Nf3 and now black holds the line with ... Kd7 37. Kxc5 Kc7. If white tries to force the issue with his knight that allows g5 which creates a companion passed pawn to the f4 pawn. If he tries to force the issue with his king then black allows him to take the a pawn but traps his own king in the a8 corner and forces white's knight to take his pawns causing stalemate.

At the same time it should be noted that computer eval shows considerable advantage to white. Black may have swindled white out of a win."
