1,0,1,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As my opponent is an unknown (I don't even know his rating at this point) I really don't know which way to go. I choose to open the c file as quickly as possible so I can play Rc1.
2,0,2,Nb6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! An unnatural square for this knight but solid all the same. I was really anticipating 6...NxN.
3,0,3,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1np3p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black gets a Slav-type pawn in and I start pondering his development chances on the queenside. I'm thinking he is going to have to spend some time to establish well positioned pieces so I'm content to just keep developing although I have no real plan as of yet.
4,0,4,1Rc1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/1np3p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',As planned. Qd2 next connecting my rooks and it's time to start pressing.
5,0,5,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/1np3p1/4p3/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - e6',!? My brain begins hurting. No way am I going to help him develop by taking and I can live with the position should he instigate. I really did think 10...Nf6 was coming.
6,0,6,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/1np3p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PP1QBPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',I have a nice long think here. 13. Nb5! only appears threatening but after 13...Qd8 14. Nd6 Nf6 then what?
7,0,7,1Bh6,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/1np3pB/8/3NP3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Justifying my Qd2 and attempting to trade a decent bishop for a strong bishop.
8,0,8,Qxg7,b'r1b2rk1/pp1n1pqp/1np3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',?! In post game analysis my opponent shared his thoughts with me that he was anticipating a pawn storm and wanted to back up his pawn defenders with his strongest piece. While a valid concern IMHO it seemed a little slow and was just begging to be punished. I'm really digging my position now as I'm ripped and ready with great activity while my opponent stills lags in development.
9,0,9,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pqp/1np2np1/5P2/3NP3/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 b - -',I go ahead and start attacking in earnest before black gets a chance to get caught up in development.
10,0,10,1Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/pp3pqp/1np2np1/5P2/3NP3/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black sees the g file opening up in the near future and makes a pre-emptive defensive move.
11,0,11,1e5,b'r1b2r1k/pp3pqp/1np2np1/4PP2/3N4/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 b - -',?! Seeking to establish a long term presence deep in black's camp. It was only after I made the move did I realize that 17...Ne4 gives me a whole slew of headaches.
12,0,12,1Nfd5,b'r1b2r1k/pp3pqp/1np3p1/3nPP2/3N4/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Either he didn't see it or he didn't appreciate it. Pretty sure I dodged a bullet there.
13,0,13,Qg8,b'r1b2rqk/pp3p1p/1np2Pp1/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black is feeling cramped and I start thinking uber aggressive thoughts. I'm calculating all kinds of sacs against his castled position but first things first - pile on as much pressure as possible before pulling the trigger.
14,0,14,2Be4,b'r3r1qk/pp3p1p/1np1bPp1/3nP1Q1/3NB3/2N5/PP4PP/2R2RK1 b - -',Adding yet another attacker into the fray while anticipating a rook lift then Rg3 or Rh3.
15,0,15,2Rad8,b'3rr1qk/pp3p1p/1np1bPp1/3nP1Q1/3NB3/2N5/PP4PP/2R2RK1 w - -',! Nice move - while having somewhat limited options black picks a winner. The d file is now his and after about 5 minutes of thinking I pretty much gave up on even attempting to even make a play for it.
16,0,16,2Nce2,b'3rr1qk/pp3p1p/1np1bPp1/3nP1Q1/3NB3/8/PP2N1PP/2R2RK1 b - -',! Holding his mate at d4 revitalizing my Rc1 opening another path for a potential rook lift and getting yet another piece moving towards the action. A very multi-purpose move.
17,0,17,2Qf8,b'3rrq1k/pp3p1p/1np1bPp1/3nP1Q1/3NB3/8/PP2N1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Getting active and looking to untangle a bit.
18,0,18,Ne3,b'3rrq1k/pp3p2/1np1bPpp/4P3/3NB2Q/P3n3/1P2N1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',I hadn't really considered this option - and I pay for it. What was once a threatening looking attack starts crumbling a bit.
19,0,19,2Rf3,b'3rrq1k/pp3p2/1np1bPpp/4P3/3NB2Q/P3nR2/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',I get my rook lift in.....
20,0,20,2Nbd5,b'3rrq1k/pp3p2/2p1bPpp/3nP3/3NB2Q/P3nR2/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',....but my headache continues. Black now gets his misplaced knight into the mix while exerting a ton of influence in the center of the board.
21,0,21,2Rg3,b'3rrq1k/pp3p2/2p1bPpp/3nP3/3NB2Q/P3n1R1/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',Still entertaining ideas of a direct assault.
22,0,22,2Bg4,b'3rrq1k/pp3p2/2p2Ppp/3nP3/3NB1bQ/P3n1R1/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',! I've been contemplating eliminating that bishop for the last 6 moves and now my opportunity is lost. Black trades two minors for a rook which usually sounds good but he also picks up my e pawn and the dominos start falling.
23,0,23,2Nf3,b'3r1q1k/pp3p2/2p2Ppp/3nr3/4B1Q1/P4N2/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',? Still trying to bring more ammo into the fight before I go nuts and try something crazy. And speaking of crazy I don't even SEE my f pawn falling like this. I feel physically ill.
24,0,24,2Nxf6,b'3r1q1k/pp3p2/2p2npp/4r3/4B1Q1/P4N2/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',! Has anyone seen my attack? It was here a minute ago.......
25,0,25,3Qf4,b'3r1q1k/pp3p2/2p2npp/4r3/4BQ2/P4N2/1P2N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',Aha!!! A nice rejoinder.
26,0,26,3Nc3,b'3r1q2/pp3p1k/2p2Qpp/8/4r3/P1N2N2/1P4PP/2R3K1 b - -',I considered this knight going to g3 then f5 with some aggressive intent but then realized that I REALLY need to remove at least one of his rooks asap as I was scared to death of them working together against me. To do that 32. Nc3 covers d1 (as well as my Nf3 covering e1). Now I just have to be careful and avoid a back row mate as I see that I can easily step out of the check that I know is coming.
27,0,27,Re7,b'3r4/pp2rp1k/2p2Qpp/2q5/8/P1N2N2/1P4PP/2R4K w - -',Getting out of harms way and protecting the vulnerable f pawn.
28,0,28,3Re1,b'3r4/pp2rp1k/2p2Qpp/2q5/8/P1N2N2/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',!? Do or die time. I'm down to about 11 minutes on the clock (he has about 25) and know full well that I will need every second in this complicated unbalanced endgame.
29,0,29,3Rxe1+,b'3r4/pp3p1k/2p2Qpp/2q5/8/P1N2N2/1P4PP/4r2K w - -',Absolutely. If nothing else I have to make some retreating moves to defend. Black gains tempo and an appreciation for superior clock management skill.
30,0,30,Rf8,b'5r2/pp3p1k/2p2Qpp/2q5/8/P1N5/1P4PP/4N2K w - -',?! Maybe Kg8 here? The rook is now somewhat impotent.
31,0,31,3Nf3,b'5r2/pp3p1k/2p2Qpp/2q5/8/P1N2N2/1P4PP/7K b - -',Still worried about some back row nastiness but I have time to improve this knight first.
32,0,32,3h3,b'5r2/pp3p1k/2p2Qpp/8/8/P1N1qN1P/1P4P1/7K b - -',Escape square.
33,0,33,3Kg8,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p2Qpp/8/8/P1N1qN1P/1P4P1/7K w - -',Attempting now to release to rook from defensive duty.
34,0,34,3Ne5,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p2Qpp/4N3/8/P1N1q2P/1P4P1/7K b - -',Honestly I'm looking for a drawing line after Nxg. I simply cannot afford for his rook to assume an attack posture.
35,0,35,3Qd4,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p2Qpp/4N3/3q4/P1N4P/1P4P1/7K w - -',! A very pesky pin I must deal with (All the while my clock seems to be running at mach speed).
36,0,36,3Kh2,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p2Qpp/4N3/3q4/P1N4P/1P4PK/8 b - -',My Nc3 is going to have to get involved and to do that he must give up covering d1 - so I make a quick pre-emptive move to sidestep the potential check.
37,0,37,3g5,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p2Q1p/4N1p1/3q4/P1N4P/1P4PK/8 w - -',A preamble to Qf4+ QxQ gxQ and a wicked hard endgame for white - I have about 8 minutes left to his 17.
38,0,38,4Qf5,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2p4p/4NQp1/3q4/P1N4P/1P4PK/8 b - -',Unpinning and covering the potential check on f4.
39,0,39,4Qd6,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2pq3p/4NQp1/8/P1N4P/1P4PK/8 w - -',? Black has the opportunity to trade queens and chooses not to. Instead he chooses a healthy (and annoying) pin.  However..........
40,0,40,4Ne4,b'5rk1/pp3p2/2pq3p/4NQp1/4N3/P6P/1P4PK/8 b - -',! I start thinking I may be able to actually win this thing as I'm allowed to bring all of my pieces to bear.
41,0,41,4Qc7,b'5rk1/ppq2p2/2p4p/4NQp1/4N3/P6P/1P4PK/8 w - -',Getting out of harms way while maintaining the pin but at what cost?
42,0,42,4Nf6+,b'5rk1/ppq2p2/2p2N1p/4NQp1/8/P6P/1P4PK/8 b - -',! Mate in 3
43,0,43,4Nh5+,b'5r2/ppq2pk1/2p4p/4NQpN/8/P6P/1P4PK/8 b - -',And black resigns (43...Kg8 44. Qf6 any 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kg8 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kh7 45. Qg7#). Many thanks to my new friend Windy for the fantastic game and thanks to all for the Charlotte hospitality. I really enjoyed playing with you guys.
44,1,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Here I'm making sacrifices for quick opening.
45,1,1,Bxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',I'm 2 points down but I have 2 pieces developed.
46,1,2,Nge2,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Protecting my knight and making room to castle.
47,1,3,O-O,b'rnb1k2r/ppppnppp/5q2/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',OK my knight is unpinned. If my opponent wont castle then I have a killer move Nd5!
48,1,4,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/ppppnppp/5q2/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Well he did ;).
49,1,5,Nd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppppnppp/5q2/3N4/1bB1P3/8/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Anyway I go Nd5 it's very strong position for knight in the centre.
50,1,6,Qd6,b'rnb2rk1/ppppnppp/3q4/3N4/1bB1P3/8/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',That move I did not expect.
51,1,7,1f4,b'rnb2rk1/ppppnppp/3q4/3N4/1bB1PP2/8/PB2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - f3',Starting king side attack.
52,1,8,1Raxd1,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p1ppp/2p5/8/1b2PP2/1B6/PB2N1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Queens are off and all of my pieces are developed but his queen side is not.
53,1,9,1Ng3,b'rnb2rk1/p2p1ppp/2p5/1p6/1b2PP2/1B4N1/PB4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',f5 square is my target.
54,1,10,g6,b'rn3rk1/p2p1p1p/b1p3p1/1pb2N2/4PP2/1B6/PB4PP/3R1R1K w - -',Now this is the funny part of the game the move i did not expect from my opponent (not with his rating). Mate in one.
55,1,11,1Nh6#,b'rn3rk1/p2p1p1p/b1p3pN/1pb5/4PP2/1B6/PB4PP/3R1R1K b - -',Thanks for watching. Have a nice day.
56,2,0,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',Fischer: I played this on the spur of the moment. I could see in his eyes that he had come prepared for a King's Indian.
57,2,1,Nfd7,b'rn1q1rk1/pppnppbp/6p1/8/2QPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Fischer: Smyslov's Variation. Theory has found no way to drive any clear advantage for White.
58,2,2,Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/2n3p1/8/2QPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Botvinnik: 9...N-N3 is more accurate.
59,2,3,1h3,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/1nnq2p1/2Q5/3PP1b1/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/3RK2R b K -',Fischer: 12 QxQ is answered by BPxQ! improving Black's Pawn structure and neutralizing White's center.
60,2,4,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/1nnq2p1/2Q5/3PP3/2N1BP1P/PP2BP2/3RK2R w K -',"Botvinnik: 13...P-K3 gives Black an equal game.

Fischer: 13...P-K3 is not in the Hypermodern spirit which is to tempt White into advancing his center Pawns in the hope they become overextended."
61,2,5,1d5,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/1nnq2p1/2QP4/4P3/2N1BP1P/PP2BP2/3RK2R b K -',Fischer: Opening the diagonal of Black's KB can't be right.
62,2,6,1Nb5,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/1n1q2p1/1NQPn3/4P3/4BP1P/PP2BP2/3RK2R b K -',"Botvinnik: 15 P-B4 is not good because 15...N/4-B5 16 BxN QxQ 17 BxQ NxB 18 P-K5 NxNP 19 R-Q4 P-KB3! and White's central position breaks up.

Fischer: On 15 P-B4 also playable is N/4-Q2 16 Q-N5 P-K4! 17 P-B5 with equal chances."
63,2,7,1e5,b'r2r2k1/pppnppbp/1n3qp1/1NQPP3/5P2/4B2P/PP2BP2/3RK2R b K -',Botvinnik: When I was preparing to meet Smyslov I made a thorough analysis of the Smyslov System in general and of this position in particular! I reckoned that whether the Black Queen went to KR5 or KB4 it would be in danger... alas my opponent found a third continuation!
64,2,8,1Qxf4,b'r2r2k1/pppnppbp/1n4p1/1NQPP3/5q2/4B2P/PP2BP2/3RK2R w K -',"Botvinnik: A very unpleasant surprise -- now White really had to start playing... it was obvious that in my analysis I had missed what Fischer had found with the greatest of ease at the board. My equanimity was wrecked.

Fischer: When I made this move I felt sure he had overlooked it."
65,2,9,Bxb2,b'2rr2k1/ppN2p1p/1n1P2p1/2n5/5B2/7P/Pb2BP2/3RK2R w K -',Botvinnik: So Black has won a Pawn; but the Knight on QB7 and the Pawn on Q6 confine his Rooks -- and also White has two Bishops. The first thing White must do is complete his development.
66,2,10,Nbd7,b'2rr2k1/ppNn1p1p/3P2p1/2n5/5B2/7P/Pb2BP2/3R1RK1 w - -',"Botvinnik: A bad mistake. Now White has the two important squares Q5 and QB4 at his disposal and his spatial advantage becomes crushing. After 22...N/4-Q2 23 B-B3 B-K4 24 BxB NxB 25 BxP R-N1 White has no more than a minimal advantage.

Fischer: I couldn't disagree more. Why should Black return the Pawn?"

68,2,12,2Ne6,b'2rr2k1/p1Nn1p1p/1p1Pn1p1/3R4/5B2/5B1P/Pb3P2/5RK1 w - -',"Botvinnik: Apparently this forces the exchange of the Knight on Qb7 as 25 B-R2 N-Q5 26 B-N2 N-KB3 is very bad for White. In fact even here 26 RxN! [pointed out by Geller] BxR 27 R-K1 gives White a real chance to get out of all his troubles. A second error running makes his position hopeless.

Fischer: Judge for yourself whether in Geller's line White has any real compensation for the Exchange and a Pawn. 27...B-B4 extricates Black."

70,2,14,2Bxe5,b'2rr2k1/p6p/1p1P2p1/2n1B3/8/4RB1P/Pb3P2/5RK1 b - -',"Fischer: Leads to a dead lost ending. I expected 28 RxP to try and keep a little ""dynamic imbalance""."
71,2,15,3Bg4,b'2r3k1/p2n3p/1p4p1/8/6B1/7P/P4P2/5RK1 b - -',Botvinnik: A pointless move since White cannot go into the lost Rook and Pawn ending.

The queen is not only backing up the knight it is attacking d4. Maybe this setup calls for an early c3 with a d4 launch coming? I could also castle or even b3 with fianchetto in mind. I don't want to let the development of black out run me here. I think I like the fianchetto it gives me a nice kingside diagonal backs d4 will prob cause opponent to d6 and I can still c3 and d4.

If I move the d pawn it really should be to d4. I think the fianchetto followed by c3. But I am worried about the knight coming down kingside.

184,6,26,5Rh8,b'7r/3k4/1K6/1p6/1P6/8/8/2R5 w - -',A terrible blunder by Fischer allowing Gligorich a chance to seize the win. 53 R-B7 ch!! wins as Fischer's King can no longer get in front of the Pawn.
185,6,27,5Kxb5,b'7r/3k4/8/1K6/1P6/8/8/2R5 b - -',Gligorich fails to seize the chance. Now Fischer takes the opportunity to draw the game.

187,6,29,Kb8,b'1k6/8/8/8/1PK5/8/8/8 w - -',Drawn. Fischer holds the distant Opposition.
188,7,0,Ng4,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppbp/p2p2p1/8/3NP1n1/2NBB3/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I'm playing this move for 2 reasons. 1 being I don't want white to exchange his black-squared bishop for mine and 2 is removing my knight so my own black-squared bishop has a direct line of sight on white's queen side. White can't move his bishop because then his knight on d4 is no longer defended.
189,7,1,b5,b'rnbqk2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/1p6/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R w KQkq b6',In case 5. ... a6 wasn't enough of an indication I was going for a full attack on that side! White has no real threat against the center right now so there's no need castling just yet.
190,7,2,1O-O-O,b'rnbqk2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/1p6/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP1NPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Despite 10. ... b5 white feels comfortable castling to the queenside! When white does queenside castling that means both sides are going for a brutal attack; white on black's kingside and black on white's queen side. Whoever attacks faster wins the game (just the way I like it!)
191,7,3,1f4,b'r1bqk2r/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1p6/4PP2/2NBQ3/PPP1N1PP/2KR3R b kq f3',The tension is building up on both sides.
192,7,4,1Kb1,b'r1b1k2r/4ppbp/p1np2p1/qp6/4PP2/2NBQ3/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R b kq -',Perhaps this move is too slow and actually moves the white king towards the location I'm attacking. But admittedly the threat of ... b4 and Qxa2 doesn't look very inviting.
193,7,5,Rb8,b'1rb1k2r/4ppbp/p1np2p1/q2N4/1p2PP2/3BQ3/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R w k -',This move serves 2 purposes: 1 is that Nc7+ no longer costs me the rook 2 is that the rook is on the same line as the white king.
194,7,6,1Bc4,b'1rb1k2r/4ppbp/p1np2p1/q2N4/1pB1PP2/4Q3/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R b k -',Protecting the important b3 square as well as attacking the f7 pawn as soon as the knight moves.

196,7,8,Bxf5,b'1r3rk1/4ppbp/p1np4/q2N1b2/1pB5/4Q3/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R w - -',But my bishop is also activated attacking and pinning the c2 pawn.
197,7,9,b3,b'1r3rk1/4ppbp/p1np4/q2N1bQ1/2B5/1p6/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R w - -',White can't hit the bishop because of 19. Qxf5 bxa2+! 20. Bxa2 (20. Ka1 Bxb1 mate or 20. Kc1 a1Q+ mate) Rxb2+ 21. Kc1 (21. Ka1 Qxa2 mate) Rxa2 and the threat of 22. ... Ra1 mate will cost white a huge amount of material.

199,7,11,Nb4+,b'1r3rk1/4ppbp/p2p4/q2N2Q1/1nB5/1P6/1PK1N1PP/3R3R w - -',Because I moved my bishop away from f5 the white knight is now pinned (the queen is behind it and is not defended). White has no choice but to move his king back. Moving his king to d2 exposes his king to a check for example Nxd5
200,7,12,Kh8,b'1r3r1k/4ppbp/p2p4/q2N2Q1/1nB5/1P6/1P2N1PP/2KR3R w - -',A seemingly quiet move but in essence a quite aggressive one! The g7 bishop is perfectly placed for an attack on the white queenside but it is held in place by the queen. This move removes this obstacle. In addition white is unable to defend the weak points on the queenside such as the b2 pawn (22. Rd2 Qa1 mate for example) and the white king is trapped there for the same reason mentioned previous move.
201,7,13,2Nec3,b'1r3r1k/4ppbp/p2p4/q2N2Q1/1nB5/1PN5/1P4PP/2KR3R b - -',Perhaps not the best move as it opens up the second file for me but in all honesty I can't think of any move I would like to do.

203,7,15,2Nxb4,b'1r3r1k/4pp1p/p2p4/6Q1/1NB5/1Pb1K3/1q4PP/3R3R b - -',Understandably not 25. Nxc3 Qxc3+ with the attack still going on while black has material advantage but the game is of course already over; black is too far ahead and controls the important a1-h8 diagonal.
204,7,16,2Rhf1,b'1r3r1k/4pp1p/p2p4/6Q1/1bB5/1P2K3/1q4PP/3R1R2 b - -',Attacking the f7 pawn but since my king isn't on g8 anymore the pawn is irrelevant.

206,7,18,Rfg8,b'1r4rk/4pp1p/p2p4/2b3Q1/2B5/1P3K2/1q4PP/3R1R2 w - -',A dangerous attack on g2 is now in place. If white moves his queen Qxg2 leaves only f4 for the white king
207,7,19,2Rd2,b'1r4rk/4pp1p/p2p4/2b3Q1/2B5/1P3K2/1q1R2PP/5R2 b - -',This moves costs an additional rook.

210,8,1,Bg2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White has chosen a somewhat weird plan in my opinion. But perhaps a big assault can be made from this spot by white.
211,8,2,Nh3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/4PP2/6PN/PPPP2BP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This move is clearly too slow. Either he moves his knight to g5 which will waste time since it can easily be chased away or it moves to f2 where it effectively does nothing

For example 13. Qd2 Bxh3 14. Rf2 (14. Re1? Nf3+!) Ng4 and white will be a full piece behind and a horrible kingside to boot.

220,8,11,Qd6,b'r1b1k3/pp2ppb1/3q1Pp1/2p5/3n2Pr/2NP4/PPP2N1P/R1BQ1RK1 w q -',White can't take the bishop because of Qxh2. 15. h3 fails due to Qg3+ 16. Kh1 Nf3 17. Qxf3 (17. Bf4 Rxh3+ 18. Nxh3 Qxh3+ 19. Bh2 Qxh2 mate or 17.any move and Qh2 mate) Qxf3+ and the bishop takes on f6 to take away any chance for white to complicate matters.

223,8,14,Qc6,b'r1b1k3/pp2ppb1/2q3p1/2pN4/3n1BP1/3P3r/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 w q -',This moves sacrifices the rook on a8 but since there is a destructive kingside attack and the rook on a8 is not part of it it will not be missed. Note that both rooks have been offered to white in just the first 17 moves!
224,8,15,Kf8,b'r1b2k2/ppN1ppb1/2q3p1/2p5/3n1BP1/3P3r/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',White has no real threats against the black king so it's not a big loss that black cannot castle anymore.

Kg2 Nh4!+ 21. Kxh3 Qg2!+ 22. Kxh4 Bf6 23. Bg5 Qxh2 mate or 23. g5 Qh3 (using the bishop which despite never moving from c8 is essential for mate!)

I find it quite interesting however it fits in to my style I like to attack and I prefer slower closed games this game will evolve into such.

This threatens the e4 pawn but white can simply ignore the threat and continue with Bg2.  5. Bg2 Bxc2 6. bxc2 Nxe4 7. Nxe5 winning back the pawn and unleashing the light square bishop on g2.

237,9,7,1Nh4,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/4P2N/3PB1Pb/PPPQ1PB1/R4RK1 b - -',Once again continuing my plan of Nf5.  Rh1 will have some more power after the bishops are traded.  Notice that the bishop on h3 and g2 create an interesting relationship.  Black wants me to take the h3 bishop.  Bxh3 Qxh3 and the queen is very hard to remove from that square not to mention Ng4 is a threat.  I want him to trade so I can put my rook on h1. Bxg2 Kxg2 most anything Rh1.

I never noticed this till a few minutes ago but notice how long the pawn on a2 hangs.  Rxa2 Rxa2 Qxa2 can be quite dangerous for black because it leaves the defense of blacks king.

This just feels bad for no other reason that it allows me to take a pawn and defend and cuts blacks queen off from his king.  Blacks best plan in my opinion is to play Qd4 here and after Qxf7 Qf6

One satisfying thing about this game is that I spent most of it focused on the d4 square and that's where the decisive blow was struck (albeit not how I expected). Annotation was mainly done as the game progressed but edited after the game.
274,11,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I've only used King's Indian systems a couple of times but decided to try it here. 
275,11,2,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',White has chosen a very aggressive opening. Black can now play d6 but I decided to delay showing my hand as long as possible.
276,11,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',If 5. e5 5... Ne8 followed by some pawn advances is fine.

I like to provoke my opponents into kingside attacks but as this game progressed such an attack would probably have been justified.
278,11,5,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2p2np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Having made my annotations I ran the game through Fritz and this is where we leave Fritz's book.

280,11,7,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/3pP3/3P4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',From this point I decided that Black's target should be d4. My long term plan was something like Nc6 Ne8-c7-e6 (but Bg4 before Ne6 to remove a defender of d4) a6 b5-b4 to kick Nc3 from the attack on d5 and an eventual f6 to open the diagonal for the bishop. I did not expect to be able to win the pawn just to exert pressure on White's position. I knew that White's play was likely to alter this course but I always need a concrete plan. (Fritz: +0.20)
281,11,8,Ne8,b'rnbqnrk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3pP3/3P4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Here we leave the World database. 8... Ne4 was played in a couple of games. (Fritz: 8... Ne8 +1.00; 8... Ne4 +0.20)
282,11,9,Be2,b'rnbqnrk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3pP3/3P4/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Now White has a dramatic lead in development but that's okay because the centre is closed. (Fritz: +0.78)

This made it hard to generate quick counterplay if White tried an early kingside attack. Playing for an early Rc8 might have been wise. (Fritz: +0.63)
284,11,11,1h4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2n3p1/3pP3/3P3P/1QN1BN2/PP2BPP1/R3K2R b KQ h3',"! The White king is still in the centre and the queen has just been moved away from the kingside. Nevertheless I think this an excellent move. The centre is closed White's pawns are pointing kingside and opening the h-file carries serious threats.

What should Black do? h6 or h5 are overly committal and would encourage White. ""The best response to an attack on the flank is a counter-attack in the centre"" but the only move available to prise open the centre (11...f6) would be premature. A simple queenside pawn march is too slow. I chose a move I had intended anyway exploiting the negative aspect of 11. h4 which I hoped would put doubt in White's mind. (Fritz is not particularly keen on 11. h4: +0.16)

Black can chase the queen around on the queenside and perhaps White was hoping h5 might be met by gxh5. Still it prevents White connecting rooks or doubling them on the h-file. Qd3 or Qa3 look stronger. (Fritz: -0.01)
290,11,17,1Nc4,b'r2q1rk1/ppn1ppbp/6p1/3pP3/2nP3P/4B3/PP1NNPP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',I was tempted by 14... f6 to activate the bishop but also with 15. h5 g5 in mind but decided to maximise the activity of my pieces first. In fact Black's at least level in development which is remarkable considering the position after 8... Ne8. Prompted by 14. Qd1 I was no longer so desperate to make use of the c-file. (Fritz: +0.33)

300,11,27,Rxd5,b'5rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3rP3/3P3P/2B5/1P3PP1/2R1K2R w K -',So what are the endgame imbalances? Both players have two pawn islands. Black's queenside majority will be handy unless White can trade with a minority attack and create an isolated Black pawn. Neither bishop is particularly active. Black's rooks are more active but White's uncastled king could be a strength now the queens are gone. (Fritz: -0.02)

On Sunday at my father's house my 5 year old daughter Charlotte spotted a chess set and some old wooden pieces.  She wanted me to give her a game.  Charlotte took the black side and I decided to go through how the pieces moved in a real game of chess.  Charlotte had been watching a battle chess tutorial so she had some idea of how the moves went and how the pieces captured.  I explained to her that white moved first and I started off with my trusty 1. e4."
442,17,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',1. ...... f5? - Charlotte decided to put her pawn on f5.  I told her it was a bit of a mistake as now my pawn can capture hers by moving diagonally.  So I then played 2. exf5.
443,17,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1pppp1pp/p7/5P2/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - good old fashioned sensible development here.

446,17,5,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/2p1p1pp/p2p1n2/1p3P2/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',6. 0-0 - I decided to keep in the habit of getting Henry to safety even though my opponent is not the Master Mater!

I explained that she could play exf6 or gxf6 or Kf7.  She moved her king.  It looks as though she has merely lost a piece but wait what I now see is a .........

When I explained to Charlotte what checkmate was and that there was no way she could get out of check and she had lost the game she was inconsolable.  She eventually turned off the waterworks about 5 minutes later.  In some ways I can understand after all in the pre-Freddy era I used to resign if I saw mate coming.  Now when I know I am about to be Freddied I either put the kettle on for a cup of Rosie Lee or if it is in the evening a nice glass of vino to drown my sorrows!  I told Charlotte that chess is a long hard road but one day she will know what it is like to win a game.

518,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Before I started the game I checked my opponent's repertoire and saw that he uses the Nimzo-indian as a defence to 1. d4 and the Sicilian as a response to 1. e4. I'm still working my way around finding a good line against the Nimzo so I chose to take battle in more familiar territory. 
519,21,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',As expected my opponent went with the Najdorf. It's endorsed by just about everyone that plays the Sicilian but for some reason it's not as popular anymore in GM practice. Much more popular are the Ruy Lopez especially the Berlin wall line and the Petroff which I dread myself.
520,21,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Today the English attack either with Be3 or f3 directly is more fashionable but I think there is a lot more venom in the old main line.
521,21,3,Qc7,b'rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A rather rare sideline but it does have a few points to it. I actually play it myself on occasion. The purpose of this idea is to save a move in normal lines namely Be7. It can lead to quite a few sharp lines but it can be positional as well. Kasparov used this line on a number of occasions. Trying to play Nbd7 preserving the pawn structure allows White to play Bc4 so it's generally accepted that this is the more exact move.
522,21,4,f5,b'rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This move tries to take advantage of Qc7 and weaken the pawn chain. As an extra bonus the Bg5 can travel back the diagonal if needed. The drawback is that e5 is now in Black's hands.
523,21,5,Be7,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black decides he doesn't want a compromised pawn structure and is ready to castle. There is another point behind Qc7 that being that Nc6 can be played which in normal lines would be met with Nxc6 followed by e5.
524,21,6,Qf3,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I'm getting ready to castle long and start an attack on the K-side. A typical Sicilian position.

In these types of positions it's also a good waiting move. For example in many positions it's better to capture on c6 only after the Bc8 has moved to d7 because capturing with the b-pawn will be weaker then.
529,21,11,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - -',This pattern of developing pieces including the pawn structure and the piece placement is seen in many lines and is very elastic since many plans are available to Black. 
530,21,12,1Nxc6,b'r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1Nppn2/5PB1/4P3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R b - -',Releasing the central pressure in order to focus the pieces on a K-side attack. It's very interesting the developing the Bishop to d7 makes the capture with the b-pawn less desirable.
531,21,13,1Bxc6,b'r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bppn2/5PB1/4P3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - -',After 12...bxc6 White can quickly get an attack going for example 13. g4 Rab8 14. Bc1 (having this square free for a Bishop retreat is another bonus of playing an early Kb1. Now b2 is secure and Black's counterplay is delayed) d5 (hitting in the centre in reply to a flank attack) 15. g5 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 c5 (with the idea of Bc6) 18. f6! (and White gets a powerful initiative)

533,21,15,1Nxe4,b'r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bpp3/5PB1/4n3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',A common trick in the Sicilian but it doesn't work so well here.
534,21,16,1Bxe4,b'r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bpp3/5PB1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Taking with the Knight is weaker because of the pin.
535,21,17,1Bxg5,b'r4rk1/1pq2ppp/p1bpp3/5Pb1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',With no nasty check. If you've played the White side of the Sicilian you'll learn that moves like Kh1 and Kb1 aren't a waste of time at all.
536,21,18,1fxe6,b'r4rk1/1pq2ppp/p1bpP3/6b1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Getting ready to win the pawn back with a slight edge.
537,21,19,1fxe6,b'r4rk1/1pq3pp/p1bpp3/6b1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',A natural move 15...Rae8 looks interesting but after the almost forced 16. exf7+ Rxf7 17. Qd3 Bxe4 18. Nxe4 Bf4 19. g3 Qc6 20. Rhe1 Rfe7 21. Nf6+ gxf6 22. Rxe7 Rxe7 23. gxf4 White has a much better endgame position.
538,21,20,1Qh3,b'r4rk1/1pq3pp/p1bpp3/6b1/4B3/2N4Q/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',The double threat on e6 and h7 recovers the pawn.
539,21,21,1Bxe4,b'r4rk1/1pq3pp/p2pp3/6b1/4b3/2N4Q/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',Removing the dangerous White Bishop.
540,21,22,1Qxe6+,b'r4rk1/1pq3pp/p2pQ3/6b1/4b3/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Here I looked at a few lines and decided that this was the most promising one keeping the Queens on the board and playing this simplified middlegame where my Knight will be very strong on d5. After 17. Nxe4 Bf4 18. Qxe6+ Qf7 19. Qxf7+ Rxf7 20. Nxd6 Bxd6 21. Rxd6 Rf2 22. g3 Re8 Black can easily hold this endgame.
541,21,23,1Qf7,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2pQ3/6b1/4b3/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',Forced or else Nxe4 is too strong.
542,21,24,1Qxe4,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2p4/6b1/4Q3/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',This was the position I was aiming for. Material wise things are even but I think I have a solid positional edge. My pawn structure is very good I have a good blockade point on d5 Black's King can come under a form of attack if Queens are on the board plus the d6 pawn is weak. Black's trumps are his Bishop which has a lot of open space to roam but nothing to bite at his command of the f-file and the central spot e5 for his Bishop.
543,21,25,1Bf6,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2p1b2/8/4Q3/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',Aiming for Be5.
544,21,26,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2p1b2/3N4/4Q3/8/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Centralizing the Knight. If things get bad I can always blunt out the Bishop with c3. You can't say the same about a Knight as there isn't really a way you can blunt out a Knight.
545,21,27,1Be5,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2p4/3Nb3/4Q3/8/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',Carrying on with the piece placement plan.
546,21,28,2Qd3,b'r4rk1/1p3qpp/p2p4/3Nb3/8/3Q4/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Overprotecting the Knight and preparing to contest the f-file.
547,21,29,2b5,b'r4rk1/5qpp/p2p4/1p1Nb3/8/3Q4/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - b6',I think Black could very do without this move. At least not until I was forced to play c3 so that the threat of opening lines with b4 would be more concrete.
548,21,30,Qb7,b'r4rk1/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb3/8/3Q4/PPP3PP/1K1R1R2 w - -',Perhaps this was the point of b5?
549,21,31,2h4,b'r4rk1/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb3/7P/3Q4/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 b - h3',Here I intended of playing h4-h5 and g4 and if Black would allow it putting a Knight on f5 which would a true dream square in this position. Of course such a plan can only work with the Queens on the board otherwise the pawn would be pretty weak in the endgame.
550,21,32,2h5,b'4rrk1/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/3Q4/PPP3P1/1K1R1R2 b - -',Putting Black's K-side under pressure. It's not easy to find a defensive plan against the threat of advancing the pawns. Anything creates weak points that my Knight combined with a Rook and Queen can quickly create a strong attack.
551,21,33,2Rxf1,b'4r1k1/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/3Q4/PPP3P1/1K1R1r2 w - -',So it's understandable that my opponent wanted to exchange material in order to tone down my initiative.
552,21,34,Rf8,b'5rk1/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/3Q4/PPP3P1/1K3R2 w - -',This really surprised me. I saw that the pure piece endgame is better for because despite the open position and the relative advantage of the Bishop over Knight Black's pawn structure doesn't compensate it.
553,21,35,2Qf3+,b'5k2/1q4pp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/5Q2/PPP3P1/1K6 b - -',Maybe 26. Qf5 would be more clean-cut but this is enough for me.
554,21,36,2Qf7,b'5k2/5qpp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/5Q2/PPP3P1/1K6 w - -',Black is forced to exchange Queens because of the discovered Knight check winning the Qb7.
555,21,37,2c3,b'8/5kpp/p2p4/1p1Nb2P/8/2P5/PP4P1/1K6 b - -',A quiet move. Black's Bishop is blunted and my King can come into play. Trying to win a pawn outright with Nc7 would have given Black good drawing chances. For example 28. Nc7 d5 29. Nxa6 Bd6 30. c3 Kf6 31. Kc2 Kg5 32. Kd3 Kxh5 33. Kxd5 Bf4 34. Kd4 Kg4 35. Nc5 Kg4 36. c4 bxc4 37. Ne6 g5 38. a4 Bd2 39. Kxc4 Kxg2 and Black is still hanging on. Lines like this show the dangers of pressing to hard and trying to win at once in the endgame. Don't rush if you can wait is a basic rule of the endgame. There is not point in compromising your position if you don't see a clear win. Just play solid moves and wait.
556,21,38,2a5,b'8/5kpp/3p4/pp1Nb2P/8/2P5/PP4P1/1K6 w - -',There is a saying in chess and it's very true the threat is more dangerous than the execution. I'm sure you've seen many GM games where they would delay executing a basic recapture almost to the point it wasn't possible anymore. This is done for a good reason. If you have a threat and your opponent can't do anything about it don't rush. Taunt him. It's very infuriating and difficult to play from a psychological point of view. You're expecting your opponent to execute his threat but he doesn't. You begin to wonder why he doesn't. Maybe you calculate everything again believing you have compensation. You can't find any. Then you look at the move he just made. It doesn't threaten anything. So you decide to remove the threat seeing as your opponent has given you an unexpected breather. Then you make the fatal blunder and see what it was that your opponent was really threatening.
557,21,39,2b4,b'8/5kpp/3p4/pp1Nb2P/1P6/2P5/P5P1/1K6 b - b3',Such is the case here. My opponent wanted to get rid of the Nc7 threat and decided that he can only defend the pawns by pushing them. But that turns out to be a serious mistake for a very simple reason. The pawns are now fixed and easy to be munched by the Knight. Also by advancing his pawns he's helping me create a distant passed pawn much sooner than I would have expected.
558,21,40,2Ke6,b'8/6pp/3pk3/pp1Nb2P/1P6/2P5/P5P1/1K6 w - -',Black decides to at least activate his King at the cost of that pawn.
559,21,41,3a4,b'8/6pp/2kp4/pN2b2P/PP6/2P5/6P1/1K6 b - a3',Notice how the Knight and pawns cover everything and there isn't anything for Black to do. He just has to wait and hope I stumble.
560,21,42,3Kc2,b'8/6pp/1k1p4/pN2b2P/PP6/2P5/2K3P1/8 b - -',Having won a pawn it's time I activate my King.
561,21,43,3g6,b'8/7p/1k1p2p1/pN2b2P/PP6/2P5/2K3P1/8 w - -',A common defence in simplified endings where you're material down is to exchange pawns hopefully to the point where there is only one left and you can sacrifice a piece for it thus securing a theoretical draw.
562,21,44,d5,b'8/8/1k4p1/pN1pb3/PP6/2PK4/6P1/8 w - -',Denying my King access to d4 and opening more diagonals for his Bishop to move on.
563,21,45,3g4,b'8/8/1k4p1/pN1pb3/PP4P1/2PK4/8/8 b - g3',I wanted to fix the K-side pawn so that I could combine threats against them with threats against the d-pawn and threats of advancing the Q-side pawns. Black Bishop couldn't possible cover all that.
564,21,46,3g5,b'8/8/1k6/pN1pb1p1/PP4P1/2PK4/8/8 w - -',Making life very easy for me. I think it was Philidor much before Capablanca tha stated that in Bishop endings it's wise to place your pawns on the opposite colour of your Bishop and on the same colour of your opponent's Bishop. Beginners usually do the exact opposite thing. They fear that the Bishop will capture their pawns and move them to the wrong colour and they want their Bishop to defend their own pawns so they give themselves a bad Bishop.
565,21,47,3Nd4,b'8/8/1k6/p2pb1p1/PP1N2P1/2PK4/8/8 b - -',Time to put the steed to work.
566,21,48,3axb4,b'8/8/1k6/3pb1p1/Pp1N2P1/2PK4/8/8 w - -',If Black doesn't capture I can play b5 and then the a-pawn will be an extra weakness in the already full plateau Black has at his disposal.
567,21,49,3Nc2,b'8/8/1k1b4/3p2p1/PP4P1/3K4/2N5/8 b - -',Defending b4 and clearing d4 for the King.
568,21,50,3Be5,b'8/8/1k6/3pb1p1/PP4P1/3K4/2N5/8 w - -',Black has to go back and cover d4 with the Bishop.
569,21,51,4Ne3,b'8/8/1k6/3pb1p1/PP4P1/3KN3/8/8 b - -',Tying the Black King to the defence of the d-pawn.
570,21,52,4Nf5,b'8/8/2k5/3pbNp1/PP4P1/3K4/8/8 b - -',Aiming for Nd4 followed by a5. The correct plan in advancing the pawns against a Bishop is to advance them on the same colour squares as the Bishop so that he cannot blockade them adequately.
571,21,53,4Nf5,b'8/8/k4b2/P2p1Np1/1P4P1/3K4/8/8 b - -',One last diversion. Ne3 is threatened and Black can't defend the d-pawn properly.
572,21,54,4a6,b'8/8/P1k2b2/3p2p1/1P4P1/3KN3/8/8 b - -',Creating a runner on the edge of the board. In case of 46...Kb6 then 47. Nxd5+ with a very simple win.
573,21,55,4Bd8,b'3b4/8/P1k5/3p2p1/1P4P1/3KN3/8/8 w - -',Going for b6 to stop the a-pawn.
574,21,56,4Nxd5,b'3b4/8/P1k5/3N2p1/1P4P1/3K4/8/8 b - -',But it's one move to slow. This Knight move makes the Black Bishop look ridiculous since there isn't anything he can do to stop the a-pawn from Queening. My opponent finally resigned here. A nice tour-de-force by the White Knight against the Black Bishop.
575,22,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The fact alone that I live in Vienna myself makes that opening very attractive for me ;-)

At the time this was considered a fully viable mode of defense. Wollner perhaps understandably was reluctant to grab that final pawn. Today theory claims that Black can wend his way to equality by giving back the material in a tactical counter-trick as follows: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5 The first pawn is given back. 6.Bxd5 Nf6 7.Bxf7+ And now the second. But hasn't Black gone too far -- isn't he dropping his Queen here? 7...Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ The counter-trap: Black regains his material. 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2. ""Theory"" judges this position to be equal. That may be true but it's worth pointing out that the position is also very sharp with substantial pawn majorities for each side. Some correspondence players have recently resurrected this variation as a winning attempt for White. It demands accurate defensive play from Black because White's pawns advancing on the Kingside ""bite"" faster thanks to Black's exposed Knight and King. In this side line there's one other move also worth considering. When Black plays ... Nf6 White need not liquidate but can instead play for central domination by accenting his development: 7.Nc3 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 One of the many interesting points in this line is that Black cannot force an exchange of Queens here thanks to a very clever tactical shot: 8...c6 ... apparently forcing the Knight to move but -- 9.Nf6+ White pulls Black's pieces forcibly into a fork! 9...gxf6 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxf6+ ... and when the dust clears White is the exchange ahead. That is the tactical rationale behind White's interesting winning attempt with Nc3. I have much more analysis of this in my secret notebooks!"

We know that Nxf7 is on general principles a poor move -- trading two active minor pieces for a R + P is a bad deal in the opening and middlegame.

Charousek has no intention of giving up his perfectly good Bishop for the Rook on f7. Instead he has spied a fascinating feature of the position.

But Charousek has seen -- and brilliantly exposes -- the dark side of Black's delayed development.

Charousek is not simply attacking the Rook: he has also used the P/e6 to cut off the defense of Black's Knight on the light diagonal from c8 to g4. In a sense this is a very sophisticated double attack. Wollner is no fool: he realizes his position is desperate. So he immediately plays for the counterattack.

I often get my Rook on the same file as the enemy King -- but my own pawn blocks the file so what's the use?"" Youth and genius do not lose heart for such trifles.

700,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game was played in round 3 of the 60th GK Tournament and it was the only game I had concerns about. You'll see why in a few moves.
701,28,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I'm always happy to see this move instead of Bb5 which is much more annoying to play against.

703,28,3,Bxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1np1B2/1p2p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The most crucial approach. My pawn structure is almost compromised but White has problems with his pieces.
704,28,4,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/5p1p/p1npb3/1p1Npp2/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',A very popular line thousands of games have been played with this line in the last two decades.
705,28,5,1O-O,b'r2qkb1r/5p1p/p1npb3/1p1Npp2/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The sharper 12. Qh5 isn't too fashionable nowadays mainly due to the reply 12...Rg8!
706,28,6,Ne7,b'r2qkb1r/4np1p/p2p4/1p1Ppp2/8/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The standard Sveshnikov structure. White could claim a significant edge if his Knight wasn't so poorly placed. 
707,28,7,1Nxb5,b'r2qkb1r/4np1p/p2p4/1N1Ppp2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',A pretty rare move. White wins a pawn with the intention of rerouting the Knight to a better square. The downside is that it opens up lines on the Q-side and my Bf8 will be much stronger on the long diagonal. 14. c3 is the more popular move clearing c2 for the Knight or Bishop and shutting the long diagonal for the Black Bishop.
708,28,8,1Bg7,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/1N1Ppp2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',14...axb5?? 15. Bxb5+ and White wins the Queen for two pieces. Now axb5 is a serious threat and the Knight has to retreat.
709,28,9,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/3Ppp2/8/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The only place to go but it's good enough. Trying to go back to a3 with the idea of c3 fails to e4 and Bxb2.
710,28,10,1e4,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/4p3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Clearing the diagonal with tempo and forcing the Bd3 to a much less active square.
711,28,11,1Be2,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This move was only played once in my database the more active Bc4 being preferred nine times. The drawback of Bc4 is that it's a little loose on the c-file.
712,28,12,1Qa5,b'r3k2r/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Putting immediate pressure on the Nc3. White's problem is that he can't shake the pressure easily and needs to play quite reserved for a few more moves.
713,28,13,1Rb1,b'r3k2r/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',Still in theory. A multi-purpose move. The Rook removes itself from the long diagonal is poised to become active in case of Bxc3 and aims to drive off the annoying Black Queen with b4.
714,28,14,1O-O,b'r4rk1/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',A rather poor move but my idea was to keep more pieces on the board. I had drawn a few recent games simply because I exchanged too many pieces and the resulting positions were simple enough for my opponents to defend. It was a risky gamble and by looking at the end result it paid off. If I were to play this line again I'm sure I would go for the stronger 17...Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3 19. Rb7 (if 19. Rb3 Qe5 with ideas of f4 and attacking on the K-side) Rg8 (a quiet move that forgoes castling in order to activate the Rook on a very dangerous file).
715,28,15,1b4,b'r4rk1/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/1P2p3/2N5/P1P1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - b3',I wasn't too concerned about this since I knew there was enough tension in the position to keep things balanced even with a pawn minus.
716,28,16,1Na4,b'r4rk1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NP2p3/8/P1P1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',The pressure on the Q-side evaporated and White has ideas of c4-c5 creating a very dangerous passed pawn. I had to think of something fast. If I play slowly White will certainly convert his extra material. I knew my chances lay on the K-side and that I had to generate initiative there. Notice the opposite colour Bishops. This is a very dangerous middlegame to play and unlike its counterpart in the endgame very much not drawish. The side that can seize the initiative usually wins since the defending Bishop cannot cover the opposite colour squares.
717,28,17,1Rfb8,b'rr4k1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NP2p3/8/P1P1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',This looks counter-intuitive to developing an initiative on the K-side but it has some concrete ideas in mind. It clears the f8 square for the Bishop so it may cover c5 and defend against the pawn push and it also has ideas of a5 activating the Ra8 and using the a-file for counterplay since White cannot contest that file.
718,28,18,2c4,b'rr4k1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NPP1p3/8/P3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - c3',White carries on with his plan and rightfully so. If there is a good and straightforward plan in a given position that is enough to win don't bother looking for other subtler ideas. Let your opponent bother with that.
719,28,19,2Ng6,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p2n1/3P1p2/NPP1p3/8/P3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Activating the Knight which now aims for f4 or e5. Still White has a considerable edge here and I'm barely holding on. I just don't have enough counterplay on the K-side to balance the pawn avalanche on the Q-side.
720,28,20,2Qc2,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p2n1/3P1p2/NPP1p3/8/P1Q1BPPP/1R3RK1 b - -',A very direct move. White wants to double on the c-file before pushing c5.
721,28,21,2Nf4,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NPP1pn2/8/P1Q1BPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Activating the Knight on a very dangerous square in the vicinity of the White King. 
722,28,22,2g3,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NPP1pn2/6P1/P1Q1BP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',A very hasty move that gives a lot of the advantage away. Better was 22. Rfd1 but even there I just my hold and it's precisely due to the Nf4 that I'm able to do so. Here is a sample line 22. Rfd1 Rb7 23. c5 (White looks won here but if chess was so simple...) a5! 24. b5 (the only move to play for a win) dxc5 25. b6 Qd6 26. Bb5 Rd8 27. Bc6 Rbb8 28. Qxc5 (it looks resignable here but Black has one good last trick) Qg6 29. g3 Nh3+ 30. Kg2 Qg4 and White can't make progress because his King is suddenly under attack.
723,28,23,2Nxd5,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p4/3n1p2/NPP1p3/6P1/P1Q1BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',I win the pawn back but White still has a good position. The plan with c5 is still very strong and I still need to be on my toes.
724,28,24,Nf6,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p1n2/5p2/NPP1p3/6P1/P2QBP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',I had a very difficult choice about where to put the Knight. I looked at Ne7 and Nb6 but ultimately I felt this was the more fighting move.
725,28,25,2c5,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p1n2/2P2p2/NP2p3/6P1/P2QBP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',A rushed move. It was wiser to prepare a little more for this move or perhaps refrain from it altogether. White could try to play against my weak d-pawn now that the d-file is open. But it's very hard to shift from one plan to another especially after you've just lost a pawn and you feel you have to recover fast.
726,28,26,2dxc5,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p4n2/2p2p2/NP2p3/6P1/P2QBP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',I looked at 24...d5 trying to create a mobile pawn phalanx of my own but it's just too slow to work. So I decided to just liquidate my weak pawn and try to find some other plan.
727,28,27,2Nxc5,b'rr4k1/2q2pbp/p4n2/2N2p2/1P2p3/6P1/P2QBP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',Another surprise. I was expecting 25. bxc5 and I still have to watch the passed pawn. White's idea was to bring the Knight to a more active square and win the pawn back. It's a decent idea but against correct play it doesn't yield anything.
728,28,28,2Rbd8,b'r2r2k1/2q2pbp/p4n2/2N2p2/1P2p3/6P1/P2QBP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',Seizing the d-file and making sure that the Knight doesn't capture on a6 with a fork.
729,28,29,2Qg5,b'r2r2k1/2q2pbp/p4n2/2N2pQ1/1P2p3/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',Attacking the f5 pawn. Other moves are slower and I would have time to either play a5 or activate my pieces.
730,28,30,2Qe5,b'r2r2k1/5pbp/p4n2/2N1qpQ1/1P2p3/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',26...a5 is an interesting possibility and after 27. Rfc1 Qe5 28. bxa5 h6 29. Qf4 Qxf4 30. gxf4 Rd2 31. Bc4 Ng4 I'm certainly not worse.
731,28,31,2Nxa6,b'r2r2k1/5pbp/N4n2/4qpQ1/1P2p3/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',I didn't understand this move. Why not capture with the Bishop? The Knight was very active on its outpost and now it will have to waste another move to come back into play.
732,28,32,2h6,b'r2r2k1/5pb1/N4n1p/4qpQ1/1P2p3/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',Getting rid of the very active White Queen.
733,28,33,2Qf4,b'r2r2k1/5pb1/N4n1p/4qp2/1P2pQ2/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 b - -',White is willing to play the endgame now that he has two passed pawns on the Q-side.
734,28,34,2Qxf4,b'r2r2k1/5pb1/N4n1p/5p2/1P2pq2/6P1/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',But so am I since my pieces are a little more active and I hope to blockade the pawns on the dark squares thanks to my bishop.
735,28,35,Nd5,b'r2r2k1/5pb1/N6p/3n1p2/1P2pP2/8/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',A central Knight is an awesome piece. It's attacking two pawns it's threatening to come to c3 and it also covers b6.
736,28,36,Nxf4,b'r2r2k1/5pb1/N6p/1P3p2/4pn2/8/P3BP1P/1R3RK1 w - -',Recovering the pawn and coming again to the active post near the White Knight. But without the Queens it's far less troublesome. However the Knight is still the trickiest piece on the chessboard as my opponent was about to discover.
737,28,37,Bd4,b'r2r2k1/5p2/N6p/1P3p2/2Bbpn2/8/P4P1P/1R3RK1 w - -',I'd say this is fairly balanced perhaps I am slightly better but White definitely isn't in any danger here. At around this move I was more relaxed about the tournament since I had good positions in all the other games and could afford to draw this game.
738,28,38,3b6,b'r2r2k1/5p2/NP5p/5p2/2Bbpn2/8/P4P1P/1R3RK1 b - -',One cannot blame this move but I'd call it rather optimistic. My opponent must have thought he is almost won around here and it's just a matter of time before he queens a pawn on the Q-side.
739,28,39,3Rac8,b'2rr2k1/5p2/NP5p/5p2/2Bbpn2/8/P4P1P/1R3RK1 w - -',The only move! But it's good enough to hold. Here I was looking at the endgame resulting from 33. b7 Rxc4 34. b8Q Rxb8 35. Rxb8+ Kg7 and I was rather looking forward to it since I have a lot of piece play for the exchange and White's King is very weak. I knew I couldn't lose this position.
740,28,40,3Rfc1,b'2rr2k1/5p2/NP5p/5p2/2Bbpn2/8/P4P1P/1RR3K1 b - -',But I had not thought of winning it either. This move looks very natural but like White's 22nd it fails tactically.
741,28,41,3Bxb6,b'2rr2k1/5p2/Nb5p/5p2/2B1pn2/8/P4P1P/1RR3K1 w - -',I saw this was playable almost instantly and after checking the lines a little deeper I was rather happy that I had managed to snag up the pawn and was probably going to win the game.
742,28,42,Ne2+,b'2rr2k1/5p2/NR5p/5p2/2B1p3/8/P3nP1P/2R3K1 w - -',The tricky Knight delivers one last killer blow.
743,28,43,Rd2,b'6k1/5p2/NR5p/5p2/4p3/8/P2rBPKP/2r5 w - -',The point of the combination. After the Bishop moves e3 is very strong and White will have to give the piece back for the pawn and I will be left an exchange up with a passed f-pawn. White's a-pawn will soon drop and the resulting endgame will be just a matter of time to win.
744,28,44,3Rf6,b'6k1/5p2/N4R1p/5p2/4p3/8/P2rBPKP/2r5 b - -',A rather desperate move. White wants to defend f2 with the Rook and capture a pawn in the process.
745,28,45,Rxa2,b'6k1/5p2/N6p/8/8/4pR2/r4PKP/2r5 w - -',I had calculated 40. Nb4 e2 41. Nxa2 e1Q 42. Nxc1 Qxc1 with a very easy win for Black. The winning plan is to push the f-pawn and squeeze the King into the corner then capture either the f-pawn or the Rook if it goes to a bad square. But White didn't feel like playing anymore and resigned here.

This is my second game with another Master buddy whose name is Jeff - the first was a bit of a disaster.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12471496&fb=1&rnd=0.36667961087623424.  As you could see from that analysis we played by the book for the best part of the game and when we came out of it boy did you see those howlers on my part!  Well in this game the improvement was that:- 1. We came out of the book on move 10.  2.  Computer Analysis only flagged up two of my moves as an innaccuracy and a mistake respectively.  The innaccuracy was on Move 14 and the mistake was on move 43 the move before I waved the white flag.  3.  The game lasted longer so I suppose it was better.  I started off with a 3 knights opening i.e. a double king pawn opening with 3 of the knights emerging. "
855,34,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - this move characterises the 3 knights opening.

859,34,5,Nd5,b'r1bqnrk1/pppp1ppp/1b6/3NP3/B2n4/3N4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',9. Nd5 - this is recommended in the World DB but it does violate opening principles of moving the same piece twice.

861,34,7,1Ne3,b'r1b1nrk1/ppp2ppp/1b1q4/8/B2n4/3NN3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',11. Ne3 - NxB would have been bad here as it would have allowed a nasty queen check on e7 or e6 forcing Henry to move to f1 and forfeit castling rights so I decided to block the e column by backing off my horsie.
862,34,8,1Nxf5,b'r3nrk1/ppp2ppp/1b1q4/5N2/B2n4/3N4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',12. Nxf5 - I traded my knight for the other bishop.  Note that Qe7+ or Qe6+ are now bad - reason the knight can go back to e3 and block and black will have lost a piece.  So Jeff recaptures with the knight and I decided to tuck Henry away on the kingside.
863,34,9,1Ne1,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/1b1q1n2/5n2/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQNRK1 b - -',"14. Ne1 - here is the innaccuracy:-  -0.46 » 14. Ne1 Qf4 15. Qf3 Qxa4 16. Qxf5 Rfe8 17. Nf3 Re2 18. Ng5 Rae8 19. Kh1 Qc6 20. Rb1 Bd4

I guess that Kf1 would have probably have been a good idea at this point at least the f2 pawn will have no longer been pinned against Henry by that wretched dsb on b6."

Qf3 does not lose a piece however because if the Wicked Witch of the West snaps up Fou Leblanc then the knight on f5 is hanging.  Glenda duly swipes it.

Here are his comments ""Well you were playing really well up until move 24 when you played Bh4. Instead taking my bishop would have been a good move. Bishop takes knight queen takes bishop and c3 to strenghen the centre. Also on the 26th move when you played Rd2 Rf1 would have been slightly better"".

877,34,23,4d4,b'8/pp5p/1b6/3k1p2/1PpP1P2/P1P3P1/4K2P/8 b - -',40. d4 - that diagonal I mentioned in a previous note has been blocked by a white pawn at last.  Alas it avails me naught because Jeff's king is poised to eat pawns after moving to e4.
878,34,24,4a5,b'3b4/pp5p/8/P4p2/1PpPkP2/2P3P1/4K2P/8 b - -',42. a5 - a little bit of thrashing around before I finally end up in a zugzwang.

The computer gave the game as 8.29 in Jeff's favour so the resignation was justified.  Hope you have had a good read!  Bye for now - Joanne

Siempre en este sistema defensivo hay que tomar en cuenta que la idea estratégica del negro es atacar el centro de peones blanco y para eso regalaron tiempos moviendo al caballo. Pero si el blanco no juega de forma activa se queda el blanco sin desarrollo de piezas y menos con centro fuerte.
Las odeas estratégicas repito son:
