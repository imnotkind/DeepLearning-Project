Damn! it looks like I will have to move my knight!...that's a pity he looks really comfortable there in the centre..where can he go?..perhaps e2 or b5..if I play Nb5 he can play Qa5+ then the knight must come to c3 where it looks safe but it blocks my c pawn which is OK if I castle queenside.  I have a positional feeling that I would be safer castling kingside then I really don't want my Knight blocking my c pawn!  The knight would probably have to come to e2 from c3 eventually when I want to push my c pawn so why help him develop.  I can move 12.Ne2 straight away which saves all those tempi (Nb5/Nc3/Ne2).

So how about straight away 12.Ne2?  It simply can't stay on d4 and e2 is a useful square and overprotects c1 and d4 (I want at least 1 rook on c1 and d4 is a very important central square with both sides black square Bishops eyeing it up).  Hang on..if I play 12.Ne2 he can respond with Bf4 threatening my Queen and also my pawn on c2 is skewered..not lost immediately but looking suddenly very vulnerable because of Black's possible 13...Rc8.  ....He can also advance e5 and then e4... I don't like any of this one bit!

Is there anything else I can do?.... I could play Ne5..is this any good?  It has potential.  My knights can both command excellent positions on d4 and e5.  I could then perhaps play f4 and then possibly my other knight could sometime move from d4 to f3..giving me a sort of stonewall position.  "

He is threatening to play f6 and after my knight retreats he can play e5 pushing my other knight onto d2.  That looks extremely passive for white and black can then even push d4 and I wouldn't be able to take back with my e pawn because he could then take back with his e pawn threatening to move his knight with all sorts of discovered checks by his rook on e8.  I'm not liking that!...   What are my other options?
I can play f3 attacking his knight.  I don't like that either it creates a bad hole at g3 and cuts off the retreat square for my knight.  Oh!..hang on he can play g3 and then my rook and my knight are being attacked...I lose a piece.
OK how about f4.  again it creates the hole on g3 or he can just take my knight with his bishop and I have doubled isolated pawns on the kings file...yuk!
Back to Nf3 and when he plays e5 my other knight goes to d2.  If he does push d4 then I'll ignore it and try to push away his annoying Knight and castle Queenside."

153,4,6,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/5pbp/1p1p1np1/pPp1p3/2P5/3P1NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',9. .... b6? - Here I overlook a discovery which should have cost me 15 rating points.  Just look at that line up on the h1-a8 diagonal.  Steve exploits this on the next turn.
154,4,7,Ra7,b'1nbq1rk1/r4pbp/1p1p1np1/pPp1N3/2P5/3P2P1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',10. ..... Ra7 - so I am a pawn to the bad my queen rook looks silly and Steve can put a knight in my pos any time he pleases!  How low can you go Jo??
155,4,8,1Bxc6,b'2bq1rk1/r4pbp/1pBp1np1/pPp5/2P5/3P2P1/PB2PP1P/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',12. Bxc6 - thankfully the first knight incursion is easily parried but I must suffer a white bishop in my camp.

Steve's castled position now looks suddenly rather draughty and equally suddenly Glenda has her beady eye on the square h3.  Can she get to it and stir up a cauldron of fear for Steve's king?  We shall see.

159,4,12,Qe6,b'5rk1/1r3pb1/1p2qnpp/pPp1N3/2Pp1Q2/3P2P1/PB2PP1P/R4RK1 w - -',18. ..... Qe6 - you would never believe that white could cop Old Matey from here with such a commanding position as this would you?  Next move however Steve takes his first step towards perdition.
160,4,13,Qxe2,b'5rk1/1r3pb1/1pN2npp/pPp5/2Pp1Q2/3P2P1/PB2qP1P/R4RK1 w - -',19. ..... Qxe2 - Glenda gleefully pulls that pawn minus back for me.  The Wicked Witch of the West goes to c1 to defend her bishop but this allows Glenda to take a second pawn on d3.  I am now a pawn up mwhhaaha!
161,4,14,2Ne5,b'5rk1/1r3pb1/1p3npp/pPp1N3/2Pp4/5qP1/PB3P1P/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',22. Ne5 - Steve's knight retreats to harass Glenda.  However Glenda wants to get to h3 and she will perform a few ingenious zig zags on her broomstick to get there.

169,4,22,Rfd8,b'3r2k1/3r4/1p4pp/pPp5/2P2p2/3Nn2q/P2QR2P/2R3K1 w - -',35. ..... Rfd8 - now for the pile on.  Either Steve loses his king or his knight.

173,5,1,Ne2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP2NPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This was not a brilliant move as it blocks the white bishop. I personally would have played 5.Nf3.
174,5,2,Nc6,b'r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP2NPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I decided to put pressure on the central pawn d4. Although attacking it now would be unwise.

178,5,6,h5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp2bpp1/1qn1p3/2ppP2p/3P1P2/2P3P1/PP2N2P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq h6',I decided to bring out my knight on the King's side and to use it to put it on g4 which I think was a good spot. But first I decided to secure g4 by advancing my pawn. Things really turned out for me as you will see later.

Well if white takes my knight I will not be immediately able to take it back (11...Qxd4 12.Qxd4 loses my Queen). However the white knight would be trapped since it cannot move (due to the threat my Queen makes on the King). so I'm fine.
185,5,13,1Nxd4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/1q2p2n/3pP2p/3N1P2/6P1/PP4BP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White takes my knight.

190,5,18,1Nxf2,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p3/2bpP2p/3N1P2/6P1/PP3nBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I decided to take the bishop.

194,5,22,1Qxb2,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/4p3/3pP2p/3b1P2/6P1/Pq3RBP/RN2Q1K1 w kq -',I take his pawn which allows me to take his rook. In fact my Queen is safe.

By the way this was my first annotation on my first win on Gameknot. Please do comment and give me feedback on how to improve my game and/or my annotations.
197,6,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The game starts with arguably the most famous position in chess.  Let me note that I truly appreciate all questions comments and critiques particularly in the endgame.  My endgame is the weakest part of my game and I'm trying to improve it so all helpful tips are greatly appreciated! 
198,6,1,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is certainly not typical and not a strong move.  It blocks the d pawn and gives the bishop no extra room.  
199,6,2,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Developing this bishop is usually delayed but I figured grabbing d4 decisively was a good idea with my opponents d pawn blocked.  d4 is a powerful potential launching pad for my pieces.
200,6,3,Bb6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/1P2P3/P2B1N2/2PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',All the pawn moves have given black an advantage in development and superior control of the center. 
201,6,4,h3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/1P2P3/P2B1N1P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Another pawn move...

203,6,6,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/1P2P3/P2B1N1P/1BPPQPP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',Later in the game I regretted this as I wanted to play f5 and the rook supporting it would have been nice but I don't know how I could have foreseen this.  I never know what the best thing to do with the rook in these type of positions is.  
204,6,7,1Bxc6,b'r2qr1k1/pppb1ppp/1bBp1n2/4p3/1P2P3/P4N1P/1BPPQPP1/RN2K2R b KQ -',The trade is a mistake in this position in my opinion.  This causes him to fall behind more in development and the two bishops will exert a lot of pressure on the center.
205,6,8,a5,b'r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/1bbp1n2/p3p3/1P2P3/P2P1N1P/1BP1QPP1/RN2K2R w KQ a6',With my advantage in development I wanted to start an attack but I didn't see how to work one in the center so I went for his flank hoping to open the center later.
206,6,9,Nh5,b'r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/1bbp4/p3p2n/1P2P3/P1PP1N1P/1B2QPP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',I didn't think that capturing b4 gave me much of an advantage so instead I threaten to come to f4 and fork the queen and g2 pawn.  I also give my self a powerful move in case of 13. O-O which my opponent missed.
207,6,10,Ng3,b'r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/1bbp4/p3p3/1P2P3/P1PP1NnP/1B2QPP1/RN3RK1 w - -',(!) The pawn is pinned to the king and the queen and rook are forked.  This gives me a material edge to compliment my superior center.
208,6,11,f5,b'r2qr1k1/1pp3pp/1bbp4/p3pp2/1P2P3/P1PP1N1P/1B3PP1/RN3QK1 w - f6',If 16. exf5 Bxf3 17. gxf3 Qg5+ with Qxf3 to follow undermining his king safety and maintaining my material advantage.

210,6,13,1Rf8,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/1bbp4/p3pp2/1P2P3/P1PP1N1P/1B1N1PP1/R4QK1 w - -',This is why I wish I had left the rook on the f file at the beginning of the game because now I lose a turn bringing it back.
211,6,14,1exf5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/1bbp4/p3pP2/1P6/P1PP1N1P/1B1N1PP1/R4QK1 b - -',Not his best response it opens up both my f rook and my LSB.
212,6,15,1bxa5,b'r2q2k1/1pp3pp/1bbp4/P3pr2/8/P1PP1N1P/1B1N1PP1/R4QK1 b - -',A good way to bring my DSB away from the center and relieve a little pressure although the light squares are a bigger problem for schagger right now.
213,6,16,Qg5,b'r5k1/1pp3pp/2bp4/b3prq1/8/P1PP3P/1B1N1PPN/R4QK1 w - -',Activating my queen and trying to get a strong kingside attack going.  This has the added bonus of keeping his queen on f1 a remarkably passive square.
214,6,17,Bxe4,b'r5k1/1pp3pp/3p4/b3prq1/4b3/P1PP3P/1B3PPN/R4QK1 w - -',I debated this for a while.  I hated losing my powerful bishop but I have always considered chess a game of small advantages which are gradually translated into powerful winning positions.  Here I have a small material advantage and as pieces come off the board that difference becomes larger proportionally so I figured that any even material trade would benefit me.
215,6,18,2Qc4,b'r5k1/1pp2rpp/3p2q1/b3p3/2Q1P3/P1P4P/5PPN/R1B3K1 b - -',He gets his queen out unfortunately and now a long and somewhat tedious fight begins surrounding the f2 pawn.
216,6,19,2Kh8,b'r6k/1pp2rpp/3p2q1/b3p3/2Q1P3/P1P4P/5PPN/R1B3K1 w - -',This is to remove the pin on my rook.
217,6,20,Bb6,b'r6k/1pp2rpp/1b1p2q1/4p3/2Q1P3/P1P4P/3B1PPN/R5K1 w - -',Pinning the f2 pawn to the king.

220,6,23,2Kf1,b'5r1k/1pp3p1/1b1p2q1/4p2p/2Q1Pr2/P1P4P/4RPPN/4BK2 b - -',This is a good move.  It weakens my position by forcing me to deal with the potential f3 negating both my threats.
221,6,24,2Qf7,b'5r1k/1pp2qp1/1b1p4/4p2p/2Q1Pr2/P1P4P/4RPPN/4BK2 w - -',Qf6 looks better but runs into 29. g3 and the rook has nowhere to run.  The queen trade advantages me anyway for the same reason as the bishop-for-knight trade did.
222,6,25,Rf4xf7,b'5r1k/1pp2rp1/1b1p4/4p2p/4P3/P1P4P/4RPPN/4BK2 w - -',I chose to capture with this rook as it got the rook out of attacking range and was a little more flexible as it keeps a rook on the back rank who can jump to any file quickly.
223,6,26,3Nf3,b'5r1k/1pp2rp1/1b1p4/4p2p/4P3/P1P2N1P/4RPP1/4BK2 b - -',Getting the knight out of the corner.  Good thinking there.
224,6,27,3Bc5,b'5r1k/1pp2rp1/3p4/2b1p2p/4P3/P1P2N1P/4RPP1/4BK2 w - -',Shifting my attack to the a file.
225,6,28,Re7,b'r6k/1pp1r1p1/3p4/2b1p1Np/P3P3/2P4P/4RPP1/4BK2 w - -',I decided that keeping the rook on the 2nd rank was more important than keeping him on the f file.  My hopes on the f file have been crushed but doubling the rooks on the a file might still have potential.
226,6,29,b5,b'r6k/2p1r1p1/3p4/1pb1p1Np/P3P3/2P4P/R4PP1/4BK2 w - b6',The pawn clearly can't capture so...
227,6,30,c6,b'r6k/4r1p1/2pp4/Ppb1p1Np/4P3/2P4P/R4PP1/4BK2 w - -',Now I have another supported on the 5th rank and I'm prepared to double my rooks.
228,6,31,3Ne6,b'r6k/r5p1/2ppN3/Ppb1p2p/4P3/2P2P1P/R5P1/4BK2 b - -',c4 might have been preferable.  Either way a pawn is lost but in that case white still has a pawn on the 5th rank and black's rooks are kept behind that pawn.
229,6,32,Ra2,b'7k/6p1/2ppN3/1pb1p2p/2P1P3/5P1P/r5P1/4BK2 w - -',I considered Ra1 to pin the bishop but the king simply moves.  With this move the king cannot get off the back rank and will be kept out of the endgame.
230,6,33,4f4,b'7k/6p1/3pN3/1pb1p2p/4PP2/7P/r5P1/4BK2 b - -',"This is a good move but I found that pushing my passed pawn (""Passed pawns must be pushed."") was unstoppable."
231,6,34,4Bc3,b'7k/6p1/3pN3/2b1P2p/4P3/1pB4P/r5P1/5K2 b - -',This is the only way to stop the pawn's advance.
232,6,35,4b2,b'7k/6p1/3pN3/2b1P2p/4P3/2B4P/rp4P1/5K2 w - -',My endgame is very weak (not specifically here but generally).  Perhaps 42. ...Rc2 was better to try to save the pawn by pushing the bishop off the a1-h8 diagonal?  I don't really know but this seemed like a safe win to me so I took it.  
233,6,36,4Nxc5,b'7k/6p1/3p4/2N1P2p/4P3/7P/1r4P1/5K2 b - -',Here white resigned.  If I had been playing white I think I would have played 44. exd6 Bxd6 and then white might be able to work a draw but with good play from black black should still get a win.  Thanks for reading and I appreciate all comments! 
234,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game my opponent resigns in just 11 moves. The fault is with playing Bc4 too early and not doing enough to protect it.

339,13,1,Qe7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is atypical.  I don't believe it's the best response but it did throw me a little and that can be a useful tool in speed games.

341,13,3,Qd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/3Qp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',(?!) I don't think I would play this in a rated game but it certainly made for an interesting game.  I think black is best served with 5. ...Nf6 but there are a variety of options.  The key points are that the queen can't be kicked by a pawn immediately (because of Qxe5) and the queen is holding the white bishop to c8 with the threat of Qxb7.  This breaks plenty of accepted principles but I haven't thought of a line yet in which white is clearly behind because of it.  If anyone sees one please let me know!

347,13,9,1O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/p2nqpb1/1p5p/2p1N1p1/4P3/1PQ2N1P/PBP2PP1/2KR1R2 b - -',I decided that if he sidestepped the center for a turn so would I.  Also this evens the d-file and gets my king to a fairly safe spot.
348,13,10,1Bxe5,b'2kr2nr/p2nqp2/1p5p/2p1b1p1/4P3/1PQ2N1P/PBP2PP1/2KR1R2 w - -',I think that he might have been better served by attempting a queenside pawn attack.

350,13,12,1Rd1+,b'7r/p2kqp2/1p3n1p/2p3p1/4P3/1PQ4P/PBP2PP1/2KR4 b - -',Now his king is exposed and I am hoping to take advantage of that before more pieces are traded.
351,13,13,2f3,b'7r/p3qp2/1p2kn1p/2p3p1/4P3/1PQ2P1P/PBP3P1/2KR4 b - -',I wanted to solidify my pawns for the endgame but there were obviously other options.  Qc4+ looks promising as it pins the knight defends the e4 pawn and forces the king to move.

353,13,15,Kxe6,b'6r1/p4p2/1p2k3/2p3pp/4P3/1P3P1P/P1P3P1/2KR4 w - -',So now it is rook vs rook and I like my position.  Although his king is more active my rook has the only open file and I feel my pawns are working together better than his.  From here it is all calculative endgame: the weakest part of my game.  Also both players were running short on time.
354,13,16,f5,b'6r1/p7/1p2k3/2p2ppp/2P1P3/1P3P1P/P5P1/2KR4 w - f6',There will be considerably fewer annotations from here because as I mentioned my endgame is very weak.  If anyone has comments on the moves please make them in the next available comment box they are always very helpful.

356,13,18,2f4,b'r7/p6R/1p6/2p2kp1/2P2P1p/1P5P/P5P1/2K5 b - -',A blunder.  In hindsight I think that bringing the king over to the kingside would have been the best idea here.
357,13,19,Kxh3,b'r7/p7/1p6/2p3R1/2P4p/1P5k/P7/2K5 w - -',Now it is all over.  It was really over with my blunder on move 29 but this has become a truly hopeless position.  From here I believe both players had less than 20 seconds on the clock and I know I had less than 5 when I was checkmated.  I will bow out of annotating from here.

404,17,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is kmccrate541's characteristic move in the French Defence.  Probably White's best response to this is to transform the game into a species of Alekhine's Defence and play 3.e5.  In the sequel Black keeps a level pegging.  More usual is to contest the centre at once by 2...d5.
405,17,1,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White has a huge range of options here.  This early development of the bishop makes sense: aiming along the most accessible diagonal towards the K-side.
406,17,2,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq c6',Good: striking at the centre whilst the d-pawn is lacking protection.

409,17,5,dxc5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2P5/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White is happy to exchange on c5 now as the f8-bishop can no longer recapture.
410,17,6,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2Pp4/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',(?!) Probably better was simply to retake on c5.  This pawn advance has its points but it leads after the ensuing melee into Black's first big mistake.

For the moment Black can't castle and his bishop is a very poor minor piece (one of the down-sides of the French Defence is the so-called 'French Bishop' - blocked in by pawns).  Black never does succeed in improving its prospects.

The irony is that he could right here have extended his material advantage by 15.Bd6! (One suspects his intuition was telling him there was something good in the position but he lit on 16.Bxh6 whilst trying to identify what this 'good thing' was).  By 15.Bd6 White attacks a rook and discovers an attack on the knight at the same time.  Black can complicate by 15...e5 but 16.Qxd5 Re8  17.Nxe5 costs Black 2 pawns.  Now Black can recover the piece and obtain a level game...

And now is the second of the two successful mating attacks.  Funnily enough Joe did not make any obvious errors in this game such as leaving pieces en prise.  He did however leave himself on for a decisive bishop for pawn sac from Fou Lenoir which created a denouement and a denuding!  This led to resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate. So how did this happen?  Well let's start with a Sicilian Naijdorf/Byrne Attack!"
468,19,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - all standard Sicilian moves.

A credible alternative to this move is g6 which leads to the Sicilian Dragon.  However I am quite OK with the Naijdorf and I choose the db option which steers me into the Naijdorf/Byrne Attack.
470,19,3,g4,b'r2qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p1np1n2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq g3',8. g4 - the first pawn push towards my kingside attack.  Is Joe gonna go kingside?  We shall see.
471,19,4,Be7,b'r2qk2r/1p1bbppp/p1np1n2/4p3/4P1P1/1NN1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',9. ..... Be7 - perfectly plausible and natural developing moves.
472,19,5,1h4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1np1n2/4p3/4P1PP/1NN1BP2/PPPQ4/R3KB1R b KQ h3',11. h4 - so he does go kingside.  Time for a Freddy style assault on his pos then!
473,19,6,1g5,b'r4r1k/1pqbbppp/p1np1n2/4p1PP/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ4/R3KB1R b KQ -',13. g5 - the pawn storm gathers pace and Joe's f6 knight is en prise.  I think Joe ought to have played b5 on the previous turn.  However I have not yet committed Henry to the queenside yet so I thought it would be sensible to get my attack rolling first before I do put Henry there so if Joe does start up something there I will now be ahead of the game.
474,19,7,h6,b'r3nr1k/1pqbb1p1/p1np1pPp/4p2P/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ4/2KR1B1R w - -',15. ..... h6 - Joe dare not play PxP due to PxP disc. ch.  Joe defends by moving his h pawn up but now I have a sacrifice planned which will lead to #3 if accepted.

Joe has no good answers to it and he acknowledged this fact in his resignation note.  I just hope I can post a few more mating attacks on this board before my rating finally drops below 1900.  Kind regards - Joanne
479,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual I start with the King's Pawn Opening.
480,20,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And he decides to respond with the King's Pawn Game.  I am surprised because I often see experts and masters respond with the Sicilian Defense but there is nothing wrong with this move.  BTW it is going to become a Ruy Lopez.
481,20,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Although black respond with 3...Nf6 in the Ruy Lopez this move is quite standard.  The reason being is that he's attacking my LSB and hoping for an exchange.
482,20,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Of course that's not going to happen.  Although Jack Stockel originally told me that the best move is to exchange either elyhim or inadowman contradicted that and told me that it's generally better to hold off on the exchange.  That 4.Ba4 is the best move.  The only problem I have with that is 4...b6 which means a loss of tempo.  However Master elyhim told me that gaining tempo is like taking money from your opponent and putting it into your bank.  In this case I agree with him because losing tempii means a delay in castling and I want to castle ASAP.  Unlike my last game against Joann castling immediately is not going to storm into an attack this time.

Afterall your opponent always has a reason for making a move.  Even if it's bad and trying to figure out the reason is key to making improvements in your games.
487,20,8,b3,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1PN2N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',In this position I am preparing to fianchetto my DSB.  Although I am not going to be successful in doing so I will succeed in my next game against him.  And that is when he will tell me that you generally want to avoid fianchettos unless it's the only way to develop.

The reason being is that he wanted to trick me with 9...Ng4 in which case my R would be trapped because f3 is not an option. Instead it's an illegal move.  So I decided to protect it with this move.  Of course this is the losing blunder.  Therefore I went from flawlessness to losing in one move because of this mistake.  I mean with f3 being prohibited he could have won my Q with 9...Bg4 and that would be the very least of my problems.  Instead he is going to play something else which actually threatens mate.  However for the first time I do not know what the best move was.    
490,20,11,Ng4,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p4/4p3/2BbP1n1/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',And it starts with this move.

Afterall I originally thought that my Q was no longer in danger and white had nothing to worry about but I was wrong.  Now he is planning a mating sequence as we will see shortly.

Afterall if I had played any other move he would simply mate with 11...Qxh2# but I was not going to allow that.  What I didn't know however is that this move would prolong the inevitable.  However he still has a mating sequence as I will explain shortly.
494,20,15,1Nxf2,b'r1b1k2r/1pp2ppp/p2p4/4p3/2BbP2q/1PN4P/P1PP1nP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',So he takes my pawn but that does not bother me.  Either way I know that he is going to mate me one way or another.  Therefore if I am going to lose anyway why not just play a reckless move.  Afterall Master elyhim told me that if you know a loss is inevitable just try any move because you might be able to pull a swindle and get a win from a lost position.  Of course that is not going to happen with this mentor.

At first I told him that he would win my Q after something like 13.Kh1 Nf4.  Then he said ""Look deeper"" and this is when I realized that mate was inevitable.  I later told him that 13.Kh1 or 13.Kh4 are my only options in this position.  After that black will mate immediately after 13...Nf4#.  He was shocked that I knew the answer.  But I resigned on that ground.  Until now I had no idea that this was a doubled check.  I figured it out however because I realize that he used his DSB and N to place me in check.  I originally only saw a the bishop check.  So the game would have ended in a mating net.  BTW this annotation is just a prequel to a different game in which I will eventually annotate.  That will be my next and final mentoring game against this opponent in which there will be a lot more to learn. "

If he plays e5 straight away I don't really know how to respond again I guess I would have to play a quick f6 to exchange off his e pawn before it becomes even more rampant!  It could leave me with an underdeveloped isolated King pawn also moving my f pawn  also hands white a lot of initiative with his white squared bishop on the c4f7 diagonal if his bishop moves to c4 making it difficult for me to castle kingside.

No...I think I'm ok with that because my knight would be very comfortable blockading on d5 if he pushes the e pawn.

In this kind of position we must look at the poorly defended king and the ""wall"" of pawns in f2 and f3 that prevents the help of other pieces in the defending of the King. Placing a piece (a Knight or a  Bishop in f4 makes a lot more difficult to defend the king as f3 and f3 pawns can't move. So knowing that a good plan here is to play Bg5 and then Bf4. After that brings the queen via e7 g5 and finally pass a rook via b6 or e6 and then to g6. With the bishop in f4 you should aim to h3 g2 and f3 weaknesses! "

787,32,0,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is Black's most dynamic defense (attack!?) and the prime reason for the popularity of Tarrasch's 3. Nd2.  
788,32,1,a3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move can lead to a sharp system once championed by Alekhine Smyslov and Bobby Fischer.

795,33,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And I am used to seeing the King's Pawn Game.  Of course this is going to become a Ruy Lopez.
796,33,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is a pretty common move in the Ruy Lopez.  But I am not too crazy about that.  Why?  I am going to exchange so his pawns are going to become doubled and eventually isolated.
797,33,3,dxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',On a normal basis I would just take on e5.  But I have played 5.Nxe5?! in order to win a pawn against Jack Stockel and he responded with 5...Qd4.  So after I defend my piece he wins back a pawn.  Therefore I just waist time so I am going to castle Kingside instead.  Afterall I generally try to castle early.
798,33,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Of course he is determined to develop so I can't fault him for this move.  But 5...Be6 was also feasible for the exact same reason.  In fact that is what I would have played if I were white.

Because of my last move I win a pawn after 7.Nxe5 which I will get to keep this time.  Instead he could have played 6...Bd6 which also develops and protects e5.
801,33,7,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p1p1bn2/1p2N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? I understand that he still wants to develop.  But best was 7...Bd7 as it protects c6.  In that white wins another pawn and attacks blacks Q after 8.Nxc6.  Therefore I have an edge but I have to be careful if I want to keep it. 
802,33,8,Na5,b'r3kb1r/2p2ppp/p2qbn2/Np6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Because he decided to attack my c6 N this is my only as anything else loses a N.  Unfortunately however I am going to make one mistake that will end the game as we will see shortly.
803,33,9,Ng4,b'r3kb1r/2p2ppp/p2qb3/Np6/4P1n1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Very interesting although I did not see it.  In this position he is threatening mate.

That's right like my game against the Master Mater when Fred was ""Back with a Vengeance"" I am only interested in winning his N.  Believe it or not I thought that this move actually does that.  At the same time however I was playing and enjoying my game.  But at the very last minute I was asked to come in and work.  Believe it or not that happened on this move.  Therefore all I was thinking about was helping my coworkers and customers as we were shorthanded and understaffed so I missed a very obvious threat.  In this position the only move was 10.g3.  Because of this however he now has an unavoidable mate in one after 10...Qxh2#.  Now if my schedule had not changed like that I would have seen the threat as I did in my game against Joann."

Believe it or not this is something that happens to Class A Players. Tom another member of the chess club whose USFC rating is also about 1800 showed everyone a recent game in an OTB tourney. Of course Jack Stockel did give some helpful commentary.  However he also lost several games and played one or two horribly. Why? His shifts changed at the last minute without any warning.

There are two plans I can follow - either move my king to b1 and try and take over the c file or to launch an attack on the kingisde.

846,35,20,1g4,b'r4rk1/1b1n1pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pp2n/4P1P1/2NBBP2/PP1QN2P/1KR4R b - g3',Going for the king side attack

848,35,22,1Nxf4,b'r4rk1/1b1n1pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pp3/4PNP1/2NBBP2/PP1Q3P/1KR4R b - -',So I take

854,35,28,1h4,b'r3r1k1/1b3pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pn3/4PBPP/2N2P2/PP1QB3/1KR4R b - h3',Instead I continued with king side operations.

856,35,30,2h5,b'2r1r1k1/1b3pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pn2P/4PBP1/2N2P2/PP1QB3/1KR4R b - -',Instead I continue my king side attack

860,35,34,2Qxc1,b'4r1k1/1b3pbp/p2p2p1/q2Pn2P/1p2PBP1/5P2/PP2B3/1KQN3R b - -',So I take with the queen

I completely overlooked that he was also attacking a2. Afterwards I was thinking that instead of taking the rook I could have played 25. Qc8+ Bf8 26. Bh6 immediately. However that fails to him playing Qxa2+ followed by Rc4+ winning my queen. But I did miss a win here. I should have played 25. b3 and white is clearly winning.

888,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Annotating games of lower rated players isn't instructive for everyone.  However it is instructive for the weaker player.  This is my first game on GameKnot so I have to start at a low rating and work my way up.  These annotations are for treborladlu.
889,36,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"This is an option many people choose against this defense.  In many cases it allows Black to transpose into the French Defense where his light-squared bishop isn't ""bad""."
890,36,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I'm simply taking advantage of the fact that White's queen is in the center of the board.
891,36,3,Qf4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/3pP3/5Q2/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',All of these Queen moves are wasting valuable time.  My friendly advice is to not neglect development.
892,36,4,Bh6,b'r2qk1nr/pp1bpp1p/2n3pb/3pP3/5Q2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',White may have assumed I was going to fianchetto my bishop on g7 because that's usually what lower-rated players have seen.  However look at every possible place the bishop could go and you will be able to avoid these types of mistakes.
893,36,5,h6,b'r3k2r/ppqbpp2/5npp/3pn1N1/5Q2/1Rb5/P1P2PPP/3K1B1R w kq -',I would like to place my knight on e4 but in order to do so I have to kick White's knight away from g5.

895,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I thought I'd annotate my loss against this opponent since I annotated the win I think it's pretty interesting for a while I had the advantage but I blundered it away Actually for most of the game I was materially ahead but I took a rook with my queen early on and lost the use of it for the rest of the game.

Be4 for example). The only solution I found (after long thinking)  was to protect it by both queen and bishop. Of course it will enable black to play eXd3

Material is equal the black king is less safe because  the f pawn is taken and white has a passed pawn while black has an isolated one.

Further to my earlier game I was given the opportunity to co-ordinate a successful mating attack against a kingside castling position.  Funnily enough Glenda ended up being a mere spectator in this game but the minor pieces managed to get together and co-ordinate a successful mating attack.  Here is how it happened.  We start off with the Ruy Lopez an opening I normally play in a double king pawn opening should black's second move be Nc6."
