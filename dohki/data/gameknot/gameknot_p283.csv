7,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',In this game my opponent played the Benko gambit.  I'm not familiar with this opening at all so I was just pretty much winging it from move 6 on.  
8,1,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I thought that my opponent would go for the Queen's Indian (2...e6 3. Nf3 b6) or the Nimzo-Indian (2....e6 3. Nc3 Bb4) considering they are the most common openings on Gameknot in the Queen pawn game with Nf6.  Instead they went for the Benko gambit and caught me completely off guard.
9,1,2,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq b6',And here we have the Benko Gambit.  I don't really know this opening very well so I decided to accept it and then just try to make the best moves since I am already out of the book.
10,1,3,Bxa6,b'rn1qkb1r/3ppppp/b4n2/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Benko accepted.  Now I have to find a way to develop the f1 bishop.  That is the biggest problem for white in the Benko gambit.  Fianchettoing (sp?) on g2 doesn't look that good because of the pawn on d5 but I opted for it anyway.  The other option is to play Nc3 followed by e4.  Then after the capture on f1 (Bxf1) my castling privileges are gone and I would have to castle manually with g3 and Kg2.  I don't like the idea of g2 without my light-squared bishop to cover the holes.  So I went for the awkward fianchetto.
11,1,4,g3,b'r2qkb1r/3npppp/b2p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I waited a few moves to develop my bishop because I wanted to see what my opponent was going to do.  Besides it's better to develop your knights before your bishops.  Now that I see that he can't take advantage of my kingside weaknesses right away I try to get my king out of the center before it opens up.
12,1,5,1Re1,b'r2q1rk1/3nppbp/b2p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I wanted to play e4 but it was pinned to my f1 rook.  Now I'm free to play e4.

128,4,6,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/4p3/3p2p1/3P2P1/7P/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq d3',A bishop line opens for white and an attack line for black by bishop - which can be refuted. White controls e5 which doesn't really even matter at this time.
129,4,7,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p2/4p2p/3p2p1/3P2P1/7P/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black overprotects the g5 pawn but perhaps Nc6 or Bb4+ to achieve development would accomplish more. The queen has the pawn covered.

132,4,10,Bxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p2/4p2p/6p1/3PB1P1/7P/PPP2P2/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The bishop has some influence here but unfortunately can also be a target to the g8 knight which will lose white some tempo in a retreat.
133,4,11,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/4pn1p/6p1/3PB1P1/7P/PPP2P2/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black obtains the initiative.

The bishop has a nice line to b7 where it keeps the c8 bishop tied to defense until a blocking or protecting move is made by black. Neither side has any great advantages and the position appears about equal.

Nf6-d5! and white will feel the pressure. Ng1-e2 would have been better. This move gives black the advantage. Black stands a little better.

146,4,24,1b4,b'r1bnk2r/pp2bp2/4p2p/2n3p1/1P4P1/2N1B2P/P1P1NPB1/R3K2R b KQkq b3',The knight has few good squares and must flee the center.

Both bishops need open lines - black has in effect 2 bad bishops because of the pawn structures of both players. Some pawn moves could break open some lines but there is the danger of not having tied rooks that will present itself if not remedied. Another problem for black is underdevelopment of pieces.

Chess is an old game played long enough that people have been able to note patterns.

But soon to my albiet inexperienced eyes it looks like a mistake. Maybe he thought he was setting something up but most moves by his knight can be easily countered. Of course I could be overlooking something but I'm gonna take advantage of what appears to be a mistake.

I expect him to Qe7 next. He might expect me to jump for the chance to grab his rook but then he can do the above scenario of taking my queen.

Black's probably gunning to get his queen on c5 especially after I castle. Maybe that's why he did the little dance with his white bishop; in order to get the awn out of the way opening up a shot at the castled king and threatening the d3 pawn and therefore queen.

I can block him preemtively with Be3 but then my queen can't protect the center knight.

The game is tight enough that we're both putting pressure on the opponent's home camp yet open enough that there's plenty of opportunity for grabbing material too. His 2 knights are really doing a good job of limiting my options. Knights are tricky too it's easy for a beginner for me to overlook their danger. For example Qd7  is easily solved by his Nf6xQ. Same goes for me trying to get his rook with my white bishop.

The options I've considered are: castleing (NG - lose my queen) c3 (cover the queen) Qf4 (protect my queen pressure him but leaves him too many options Be3 (protect queen get 2nd bishop into play not bad) or Bf7 .

I'm choosing the last one. He might be able to squirm out of it but I should end up with a material advantage (namely his queen) and if he makes a mistake even a checkmate in 2 moves. When he moves his king out of check his only choice is e7 which blocks his bishop that's covering his queen."

But in the meantime I can probably grab some material and by forcing his move have more say in the outcome.

I'd like to get more of my pieces into play. Taking out that pesky knight on b4 sure would be nice too. At this point castling is not so important to protect my king but rather to get a rook into play. In fact castling could endanger my king by leaving him exposed to blacks black bishop and also by blocking myself in with the corner pawns creating the possiblility of getting trapped by an attack of his rooks on the 1st rank. So I'll hold off on that.

But the way things are now with him on the run and a material deficit that's not a big worry. The number one task for me now is to um god save the queen. If we were chess geniuses who knows there might be some advantage to sacrificing the queen to avoid a trap but at the moment that's obviously not the case.

I'm going to take his b5 pawn. The queen will still be in a position to threaten the king and protect my pieces. I'm guessing he'll Kc8 to find an escape route. I'd be delighted it if he does Ke7."

okay as you can tell by my notes I wasn't expecting that. Frankly I was too caught up in my attack to notice. So let that be a lesson to fellow beginners: don't forget that the other guy has plans too.

Moving my king to d2 might be a bad idea. If he checks with Bb4 I can just scoot the king over and grab his knight which would be nice. But he might not do that. He might just grab my a1 rook instead. If his f6 knight were out of the way I could check with my queen easily -- but the knight is there so I'd like to take it with my black bishop. But if my king is on d2 as above he's in the way of my black bishop.

e2 might also be bad. picture this scenario: king goes to e2 safe for now. He moves his c2 knight to d4 check again. I move king to safety he takes my queen with the knight.

so I'm thinking d1. It threatens his knight who will probably just take my rook. Then I can get my black bishop into play and try to get rid of his damn knight on f6. One good thing that will come out of this is I can get my other pieces into play finally (like the h1 rook) but I wish the circumstances were a little different.

Other things I'm thinking about are taking his g8 rook in a sacrifice bid (but probably a bad idea) or now that his forward (c2) knight is out of the way checking with Nc6 using the knight and queen to mess with him."

I need to move my queen both to safety and to somewhere where she can be effective. That's my immediate priority. My guess is he'll start applying pressure with his forward night white bishop and maybe finally get the black bishop into play. I hope to do the same to him first.

I think 19 Qb7 accomplishes that. He might move his rook to safety attack my knight with his black bishop or do something funky with his forward knight.

He takes my bishop I check with my queen (Qd5) he moves the king to safety (Ke7) I check with my knight (Nc6) he takes said knight (Nxc6)... it's still a bad situation for him but with every move there is the chance that I'll make a mistake and he can stay in the game. 

So blocking with his bishop seems like he's not paying attention. I can easily checkmate. To his credit he's playing a dozen games at the same time while I've only got two. So I guess he overlooked something. Or maybe I have...

Anyway I think it's 22 Qd5  ..Bd7 (he blocks w white bishop) and 23 Qxd7  "
253,7,23,Bd7,b'2rk3r/2pbbBpp/5B2/p2QN3/3n4/3P1P2/PP4PP/RN1K3R w - -',"Game over. 
Black (jason2141) resigned and said ""good game."" (otherwise 23 QxBd7 checkmate)

Off the top of my head I'd say some key points were when he lost his queen and early in the middle game when he managed to presure my side and when I first checked with my white bishop 15. Bf7 . The bishop-knight combination really held things together for me. For his part he really kept me off balance by making good coordinated use of his 2 knights. My feelings towards the game from start to finish went ""I'm gonna win this this guy is moving strangely... oh jeez I didnt see that maybe I've left myself vulnerable... okay tables have turned again and if I keep the pressure on I'm set."""
254,8,0,Qg6,b'5k2/3Q4/6q1/5N2/4K3/8/8/8 w - -',Now it would be very rare for this endgame to occur in a real game but it's possible that this position and similar ones could pop up in some games maybe after a series of mass exchanges. It's White's move here and there is one move that obtains the win. Seeing how White wins this ending should open your mind to deep attacking ideas because of the complexity of this study.
255,8,1,3Qe7+,b'5k2/4Q3/6q1/5N2/4K3/8/8/8 b - -',White has to keep the pressure on the king. Tempo and activity are the most important thing in endings regarding major pieces. If White doesn't check Black then Black has the tempo and can draw with perpetual check. The only other checks allow Black to trade queens which is a dead draw. 
256,8,2,3Kg8,b'6k1/4Q3/6q1/5N2/4K3/8/8/8 w - -',White's illusory threat of Qg7# isn't much but White's next zugswang tactic exploits that idea forcing the queen to stay on the g-file to defend that threat.
257,8,3,3Ke5,b'6k1/4Q3/6q1/4KN2/8/8/8/8 b - -',White has hidden his king from queen checks and Black is in zugswang. Black must move his queen to a safe square on the g-file to maintain the defense of the mate threat. If Black tries 35...Kh8 then 36.Qh4  Qh7 (Kg8 Ne7 ) 37.Qd8  Qg8 38.Qf6  Kh7 39.Qh6#
258,8,4,3Qg2,b'6k1/4Q3/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 w - -',"If Black plays Qg1 then White has an in-depth tactic to exploit the far placed queen 35...Qg1 36.Qe6  now if Black tries Kh7 or Kh8 then 37.Qh6  Kg8 38.Ne7  Kf7 39.Qe6  where Black gets his queen skewered after 39...Kg7 40.Qg8  Black gets mated after 39...Ke8 40.Nd5  Kf8 (Kd8 Qd7 Kc8 Qc7#) 41.Qe7  Kg8 42.Nf6  Kh8 43.Qh7# and Black also loses after 35...Qg1 36.Qe6  Kh 37.Qh6  Kg8 38.Ne7  Kf7 39.Qe6  39...Kf8 40.Ng6  Kg7 41.Qf6  and Black's queen will get skewered on the g-file since White can force Black to the h-file after 41...Kh6 Nf8  Kh5 Qh8  Kg4 Qg8  (this won't work if Black's queen is on g2)
So Black is totally lost in all variations if he tries 36...Kh7 or 36...Kh8. 

Against 36...Kf8 in that variation 37.Qh6  and if 37...Ke8 then 38.Nd6  and White has a mating attack with the queen and knight by checking every move. A sample mate is 37...Ke8 Nd6  Kd7 Qe6  Kc6 Qc8  Kb6 Qb7  Kc5 Qb5#
37...Kf7 also loses after Qh7  Kf8 Qh8  Qg8 (If Kf7 then Nd6  Ke7 Qe8#) Qf6  Qf7 Qd6  Ke8 Qb8  Kd7 Qb7  Ke8 Nd6 
37...Kg8 also loses since Ne7  Kf7 Qe6  reaches the position discussed at the top of this analysis so after looking at all those variations we can safely say that Qg1 loses in all variations now let's look at Qg2."
259,8,5,3Qd8+,b'3Q2k1/8/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',Although Qg1 and Qg2 don't seem very different they make White win in totally different ways. The queen skewering tactic doesn't work with the queen on g2 since it is close enough for the king to defend in that tactic. White needs to find a different way to win here and the way will be getting the king to the 6th rank to overload Black with mate threats. The king cannot get to the 6th rank now because of perpetual check from Black so White needs to maneuver the queen to a square that will block queen checks. The square White needs to go to is c7 to stop Qc6  after Kf6. White's queen can take away Black's queen's squares using checks to maneuver it to c7. This attacking idea wouldn't have worked with the black queen on g1 since the queen controls too many squares from there. White had two very different winning ideas which were based on where Black chose to move his queen on move 35.
260,8,6,3Kh7,b'3Q4/7k/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 w - -',Kf7 loses to Nh6  where Black gets skewered next move
261,8,7,3Qc7+,b'8/2Q4k/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',White's queen has gotten to the desired square using checking tempos. Black can play Kg8 or Kh8 here but Black's king is still cornered and White uses tactics to exploit it in any case.
262,8,8,3Kg8,b'6k1/2Q5/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 w - -',If Kh8 then 38.Kf6 and play is similar to the text. White intends to play Qe5 reaching a similar position to move 39. If 38...Kg8 then Nh6  initiates the threat White has next move.
263,8,9,3Kf6,b'6k1/2Q5/5K2/5N2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',"The key squares controlled by the White queen are b6 c6 g3 and c2.
Control of c6 prevents Qc6 
Control of b6 prevents Qb2  Kg6 Qb6 
Control of g3 allows Qb2  Kg6 Qg2  Ng3 where all of Black's checks are blocked and Black cannot stop both mate threats of Qg7# and Qd8# 
Since checking White gives White the unstoppable mating threats Black's only move is 38...Kh8 since White is threatening Nh6  Kh8 Nf7  Kh7 (Kg8 Qd8  Kh7 Qh8#) Ng5  and Black loses with Kh6 Qh7# or Kg8 Qh7  Kf8 Qf7#"
264,8,10,3Qe5,b'7k/8/5K2/4QN2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',This position is similar to one discussed a couple moves ago but the placement of the Black queen doesn't matter since White's discovered check threat defends against possible queen checks from Black.
265,8,11,3Kh7,b'8/7k/5K2/4QN2/8/8/6q1/8 w - -',"Black stops the discovered check threat. Kg8 does also but Ne7  and Black is mated next move. Black's other defensive tries also lose.
If 39...Qg8 then 40.Qd4 and White threatens Qh4# while also maintaining the discovered check possibility which leads to mate since Black's queen is forced off g8 freeing f7 and g6 for the White king to assist in the mate.
If 39...Qg4 then Kf7  Kh7 Qh2 
If Black moves queen off g-file then Kg6  Kg8 Qe8#
If 39...Qg1 then Ng3 blocks the g-file and Black's queen can no longer stop White from doing the discovered check mating sequence. King moves from Black just allow a mating attack from several queen checks"
266,8,12,4Qe7+,b'8/4Q2k/5K2/5N2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',This checking process will reach a position similar to the position before Kh7 except that one difference will make it so that Black cannot play Kh7.
267,8,13,4Kh8,b'7k/4Q3/5K2/5N2/8/8/6q1/8 w - -',Kg8 would allow Nh6  Kh8 Nf7  where Black is mated after (Kh7 Ng5  Kg8 Qe8#) or (Kg8 Qe8  Kh7 Qh8#)
268,8,14,4Qe8+,b'4Q2k/8/5K2/5N2/8/8/6q1/8 b - -',This forces Qg8 since Kh7 loses to Qh5  Kg8 Ne7  Kf8 Qh8#
269,8,15,4Qe5,b'6qk/8/5K2/4QN2/8/8/8/8 b - -',"This position is almost the same as on move 39 except that Black's queen has been forced to g8. Since White has forced Black to block a square from his king Kh7 (played on move 39) is now met by Qh2#
Now Black's queen must move and depending on where Black moves the queen White will transpose into one of the positions discussed on move 39 because of this tempo gain."
270,8,16,4Qg1,b'7k/8/5K2/4QN2/8/8/8/6q1 w - -',"Qf8  allows Kg6  Kg8 Nh6  and Black's only legal move is giving up the queen.
Qg4 allows Kf7  Kh7 Qh2 
The text move reaches one of the winning variations I discussed on move 39 about how Black loses if he doesn't play Kh7.
Qg2 would reach the exact same position after White's 39th move except that it is White's move because of White's tempo gain. Qg1 and Qg2 both lose to Ng3"
271,8,17,4Ng3,b'7k/8/5K2/4Q3/8/6N1/8/6q1 b - -',If you don't remember this position from my analysis on move 39 this move blocks the g-file and Black's queen can no longer stop White from doing the discovered check mating sequence. King moves from Black just allow a mating attack from several queen checks. No matter what Black does here White will be able to mate in 3 moves or less. 
272,8,18,4Qg7#,b'8/6Q1/5K1k/8/8/6N1/8/6q1 b - -',Even though the chances of this endgame occurring are very slim hopefully studying the ideas and attacking sequences have helped you.

White appears to have an advantage here with more development and space.  He has also created a backwards pawn on d6 unless he plans to push with d5 but this wastes time.
337,10,5,Bb3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I did not want to lose some of my center with 7...Nxe4 8 Nxe4 d5 and I wanted to keep pressure on f7.

366,11,10,Qh3,b'6rk/7p/1Q3p2/2p4r/P2p1P2/1P5q/2P2RPP/4R1K1 w - -',He did the move I thought of first. It was obviously what he was intending and he did it even though I had made a move changing  the board. I have a threat that I did not have one move ago. That will cost him the game.
367,11,11,3Qxf6+,b'6rk/7p/5Q2/2p4r/P2p1P2/1P5q/2P2RPP/4R1K1 b - -',Bam! It is now mate in one. He is one move away from mate himself but he will not get to make that one move.

He should move his queenside pawns in a minority attack a3-b4-b5 and once black is forced to compromise his queenside pawns the power of white bishop on g2 would grow.

442,15,0,3Rc6+,b'8/8/2R5/2k5/8/2n5/2r5/K7 b - -',This is the starting position of the endgame I would like to demonstrate. When the remaining pieces left on the board are a rook vs. a rook and knight the game is almost always a draw. In this case White's king is completely trapped on a1 so Black can win because of the strong threat of Ra2#. White's king is also stalemated so White's rook is invincible and is trying to sacrifice itself for stalemate.
443,15,1,3Ra3+,b'8/8/8/8/k7/R1n5/2r5/K7 b - -',"35.Rb4  would've lost quicker to Ka5 where White's rook has no more checks and Black still threatens Ra2#
36.Rb2 stops Ra2# but also allows Rc1#"
444,15,2,3Kb4,b'8/8/8/8/1k6/R1n5/2r5/K7 w - -',Here White must move the rook along the a-file to hold on the longest. White loses quicker if he keeps trying stalemate attempts like if 36.Rb3  then 36...Kc4 37.Rb4  (37.Ra3 Rc1  38.Kb2 Rb1#) Kc5 38.Rc4  Kb5 39.Rc5  Kb4 40.Rc4  Ka3 and the White rook has no more stalemate tricks and White cannot defend against Ra2# without losing his rook.
445,15,3,Rh2,b'R7/8/8/8/1k6/2n5/7r/K7 w - -',The next step in completing the winning process is getting the rook out of the way (the farther the better) to make room for the king to come onto c2. Black's idea is to checkmate with Rh1# once he gets his king to c2 where it is shielded by the knight from rook checks
446,15,4,3Rd8+,b'3R4/8/8/8/8/2nk4/7r/K7 b - -',Every move has to be check otherwise the rook must head back to the a-file to defend Ra2# but now that Black's king will successfully reach c2 White has to defend the new mating threat of Rh1#
447,15,5,4Rh8,b'7R/8/8/8/8/2n5/2k4r/K7 b - -',Since the defending king is stalemated in the corner the attacker must be on the constant lookout of rook sacrificing tricks that exploit the stalemate. This is the only move that defends against Rh1#
448,15,6,4Rd2,b'7R/8/8/8/8/2n5/2kr4/K7 w - -',Since White can move along the 8th rank and challenge the Black rook wherever it goes the Black rook needs to threaten mate from a square where the knight is prepared to block the path of White's rook.
449,15,7,Nd5,b'3R4/8/8/3n4/8/8/2kr4/K7 w - -',Now Black's new mating idea is getting the king to b3 and the knight to b4 with an unstoppable mate. Black will continue an array of mating ideas that White will keep having to defend until White can defend no longer. The only moves that stop Black from reaching the desired position of Kb3-Nb4 are Rb8 and Ka2.
450,15,8,4Rb8,b'1R6/8/8/3n4/8/8/2kr4/K7 b - -',"42.Ka2 would lose quicker after 42...Rd4 (42...Nb4  Ka1 Rxd8 doesn't work because that's stalemate)
Play could continue with 43.Ka3 Rd3  44.Ka4 (Ka2 Nb4  Ka1 Ra3#) Nc3  discovers an attack on the rook and wins it.
After 42.Ka2 Rd4 White can try 43.Ra8 but Black wins with 43...Nc3  44.Ka3 (Ka1 Rd1#) Nb5  45.Ka2 Rb4 and Black threatens two different mate in 2's so the game could end 46.Ka1 Rb1  Ka2 Nc3  Ka3 Rb3# or 46.Rc8  Nc3  and White must give up the rook to stop Ra4#"

454,15,12,4Nb4,b'8/8/8/1R6/1n1r4/2k5/8/K7 w - -',The difference with Nb4 in this variation is that the rook is not horribly placed on b2 anymore so White can defend the mate threats longer with a rook check.
455,15,13,4Kb1,b'8/8/8/2R5/1n1r4/1k6/8/1K6 b - -',White's only other defense to the Rd1 mating threat was 46.Rc1 which loses quicker to 46...Nc2  47.Kb1 Na3  48.Ka1 Ra4 and White cannot stop the mate in 2 threats (Nc2  Kb1 Ra1#) and (Nc4  Kb1 Nd2#) without giving up the rook.
456,15,14,4Rh4,b'8/8/8/2R5/1n5r/1k6/8/1K6 w - -',Black must make room on the d-file by moving the rook along the 4th rank because Black wants to play Nd3 to guard c1 so that the back rank mate threat is effective.
457,15,15,4Rc8,b'2R5/8/8/8/1n5r/1k6/8/1K6 b - -',"White must maintain the rook on c-file to stop back rank mate. 47.Rc1 loses quicker because play could continue:

458,15,16,4Rc1,b'8/8/8/8/1n6/1k6/8/1KR4r b - -',This can be considered the key position to winning rook and knight vs. rook when the enemy king is trapped.

In this key position there are many ways the game could end. If White's rook moves along the 1st rank then Rh3 stops a 3rd rank rook check and Black's mating idea is Na2 (Rd3 first if Kc1) Rh2 followed by Nc3  with mate on Rc2# or Ra2#
During the mating process White cannot move the rook off the 1st rank because of many mate threats beginning with Rh1 "

If White moves his rook along the 1st rank on move 49 then Black has the same idea explained earlier of Rh3 (stopping rook check) then Na2 (Rd3 first if Kc1) followed by Rh2 followed by Nc3  with mate to follow (Ra2# or Rc2#). The White rook has to sit passively on the 1st rank during that mating process."

466,15,24,Nd3,b'4r3/8/8/2R5/8/1k1n4/8/1K6 w - -',The reason Black had to get White's rook to c5 is because Black needs this tempo move to make progress in the attack now White's only move is Rb5  because of Black's Re1 threat.
467,15,25,Kc3,b'4r3/8/8/1R6/8/2kn4/8/1K6 w - -',The difference in this position and the position with White's rook on the 7th rank is that White cannot check on the c-file where White could've checked if the rook hadn't been removed from the 7th rank. Black's patient Re8 move earlier served great purpose and Black's long-awaited mate is coming closer. White cannot do anything in this position because there is no defense to Re1  Ka2 Nb4  Ka3 Ra2#
468,15,26,5Rb7,b'4r3/1R6/8/8/8/2kn4/8/1K6 b - -',Any other move is just as losing. Black's mating attack was able to be carried out by zugswanging the White rook and forcing it onto a bad square where Black can gain tempo in the attack and the rook isn't in a position to check and stall his death. This shows how proper calculation and choosing the right mating ideas can slowly squeeze an opponent in and endgame like this. I hope you enjoyed viewing this study even if you never get an endgame like this just the ideas and technique used to win this ending can still help you in your games.

486,18,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black does not commit to immediate exchanges in the center and can choose from a variety of openings.
487,18,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A classical pawn center controlling the center from the center and holding more ground.
488,18,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black selects the French opening and introduces a little tension in the center. The e4 square is the weakness for white - no protection and e5 is weak for black and can be used to limit the development of the g8 knight by e4-e5 if the opportunity is taken immediately.
489,18,4,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move introduces the French Tarrasch opening.  An interesting alternative is 3.c4 dxe4  4.Nc3 Nf6  5. f3 Bb4 the Diemler Duhm gambit main line. The text move leaves the d4 pawn without protection while protecting the e4 pawn and it blocks the influence of the queen and also blocks the bishop at c1.
490,18,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',The French Tarrasch Open. Black contests the center immediately while neglecting both development and king safety.
491,18,6,Ngf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White develops a second piece while protecting d4.

It is interesting to note that black while still underdeveloped has a greater control of d4 because of the positional weakness of white having a knight on d2.
493,18,8,exd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pP4/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White decides that the inevidible c5xd4 could only be countered by c2-c3 - because the d2 knight can not move without dropping e4 - no queen protection for the pawn - so decides to initiate an attack. White may be reserving the queenside for castling assuming that black will castle kingside which means that attacking with f2-g2-h2 will be beneficial. There will be a bit of a problem with the pressure on d4 after Qd8xd5 but this may be resolved with some work. -1p

White stands a little better because of having a ready 0-0 available and because no diagonal attacks can be applied against the king due to the position and because of better development. The only downside may be found after c5xd4 where black will have a little better pawn center - which may mean nothing more than offering protection of f7 or supplying support at d5 for a knight.
497,18,12,a6,b'r1b1kbnr/1p1q1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2BP4/1N3N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black pursues a course of attack. The lack of development of the the king should warn against this move. White can castle to safety and then begin operations that will have increasingly better chances at attacking the king that is still in the center at e8. The plan of b7-b5 to chase the bishop does not accomplish enough. White can counter the text move by simply playing d4-d5 where if e6xd5 then Bc4xd5 and white can play on with ease.
498,18,13,Be3,b'r1b1kbnr/1p1q1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2BP4/1N2BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White still appears to be following a strategy involving 0-0-0 and continues to develop pieces. White has 4 pieces controlling d4 completely and an assessment of the rest of the white pieces shows how white has domination in the center while black has the drawback of limited mobility due to underdeveloped pieces and limited space and almost nonexistant open diagonals. Open diagonals are very import for bishops. White stands better positionally and is better developed.

Black controls d5 because of the pawn vs pieces advantage but white has control of more central squares with the exception of e4. Of course there is the matter of removing the threat on d4 first that must be attended. -2P-1p

The move Qd1-d2 may obtain the annoying Bd6-b4 which would require c2-c3 blocking the attack but weakening the potential castle.
503,18,18,1b5,b'r1b1k1nr/3q1ppp/p1nbp3/1p6/2B5/1N2BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq b6',Black decides to make the queenside unwelcome and pursues the bishop. This move really helps white to move the bishop to a better position. Bc4xe6 offers nothing. Black can get away with the attack because there is no safe and open white color diagonal for white to use for an attack.
504,18,19,1Bd3,b'r1b1k1nr/3q1ppp/p1nbp3/1p6/8/1N1BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This move has good and bad merits. The future goal of Bxh7 or supporting Qxh7 is good but there is the matter of a possible future fork by e6-e5-e4. Perhaps Bc4-e2 is better by keeping away from a future tactic.
505,18,20,1Nf6,b'r1b1k2r/3q1ppp/p1nbpn2/1p6/8/1N1BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black catches up in development and is starting to obtain a better position by developing pieces that control the center while clearing the back rank.
506,18,21,1Nc5,b'r1b1k2r/3q1ppp/p1nbpn2/1pN5/8/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White attempts to swindle a trade of B for N to obtain an advantage. Perhaps castling would be better now since black is very close to obtaining a lead in development.

White has an advantage due to the pawn majority and 2 bishops.
513,18,28,1Ne5,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/p2qpn2/1p2n3/8/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black seeks to level the playing field hopeing to score a bishop.

533,19,0,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',This is a league game played in 2003. I am putting in on GameKnot because I feel that the game overall (especially opening) is very instructive and shows a good recipe for Black against this rare opening. My opponent was a strong master candidate and one of a few prominent Sokolsky players in Croatia. Fortunately for me I played against another proponent of this opening (interestingly also a strong MK) a relatively short while before this game so I had some experience to rely on. I was a clear underdog but had accumulated enough wins against strong players by that time to be relatively confident in myself.
534,19,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This move is one of the 2 main continuations (the other one is 1...d5). The idea is that Black is willing to give his e pawn for White's b pawn but for compensation he will get good development and some central pressure.
535,19,2,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',This is the position that Black intended with 1...e5. Black has a slight lead in development and eventually Be5 will have to move (losing another tempi) or be exchanged for a Knight (giving Black a pair of Bishops).
536,19,3,e3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',"Last move both players played moves that are ""mandatory"" (the most natural). This allows maximum flexibility regarding the middlegame - but now choices have to be made which will define the later play. 5.c3 is possible here but then after 5...Ba5; 6.d4 d5; 7.e3 Ne4 Black is in great shape and even has a slight advantage. The main problem is that White is passive so can't really play for a win."
537,19,4,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ d6',The most active move taking advantage of the chance to occupy the centre. In my first Sokolsky game I played 5...Nc6 and had a good game (lost in heavy time trouble in an equal ending) but in analysis I concluded that Black should play c5 before Nc6 thus gaining more influence in the centre. This game was a good chance to see how this idea will work in practice. 5...d6 is also OK but a little passive.
538,19,5,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b6/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',Preparing to castle and free the d pawn to move. Since Black will likely play Bg4 e2 is the best place for the Bishop.

Actually it is objectively equal but Black has active piece play and a clear plan qualities that I like in my positions :)
540,19,7,c4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2ppB3/1bP3b1/4PN2/P2PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - c3',Staking a claim in the centre but also allowing Black to open the d file for himself. After some thought I decided to ignore it for now and finish development.
541,19,8,Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppB3/1bP3b1/4PN2/P2PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',This is the situation I mentioned earlier. White either has to retreat the Bishop (losing time) or lose it to a Knight (giving the Bishop pair advantage to Black). In either case I like Black's position.
542,19,9,Bb2,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/1bP3b1/4PN2/PB1PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Here I was calculating 9.Bf6 Qf6; 10.cd5!? Qa1; 11.dc6 bc6 and decided that this is pretty unclear but since Black is an exchange up and has a pair of Bishops it is looking promising enough.
543,19,10,Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/1bP3b1/4PN2/PB1PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Starting to pressure the central files. The idea is to play Qd6 (to keep protection of both d5 and Nf6) and Rad8 to maximize the pressure. All Black's pieces are coordinated and concentrating on this part of the board. Meanwhile White still has to catch up with development. This is why I think Black has a slight practical edge here although to be fair the position is still objectively even. Time spent from the clock: 4 minutes
544,19,11,1cxd5,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pP4/1b4b1/4PN2/PB1PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Otherwise Black can wait for Nc3 and then push d4 or just take dc4 when it is opportune.
545,19,12,1h3,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2pn4/1b4b1/4PN1P/PB1PBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Creating an outlet for the King and putting a question to Bg4 (Bf3 Bh5 or Bf5?) but also slightly weakening the castling position. ----- I need to clarify that - since Black's pieces are active this is a potential weakness. If Black was passive or White equally active this would not be a weakness.
546,19,13,1Bh5,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2pn3b/1b6/4PN1P/PB1PBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',I decided to maintain the pressure on d1-h5 diagonal. I had some vague ideas about White's pieces on d1 e2 and f3 :)
547,19,14,1Qb3,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2pn3b/1b6/1Q2PN1P/PB1PBPP1/RN3RK1 b - -',A solid multipurpose move - getting away from Bh5 allowing 13.Nc3 without break-up of pawn structure potentially threatening b7 and clearing d1 for a Rook if necessary.

I think White knew this was not best but since he was the favourite in this game he didn't want to allow mass exchanges - 13.Nc3 Bc3 (13...Nc3?!; 14.dc3 with Rad1); 14.Bc3 (14.dc3 Nf4=) Nc3; 15.Qc3 Bf3; 16.Bf3 and the game is most likely a draw.

551,19,18,1exf4,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p4b/1b3P2/NQ3N1P/PB1PBPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Slightly better is 14.Bd1 (14.Qd1? Ne2; 15.Qe2 Ba3; 16.Ba3 Nd4! with big advantage) when Black has a pleasant choice between 14...Nd3 and 14...Na5.
552,19,19,1Nc4,b'r5k1/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p4b/1bN2P2/1Q3N1P/PB1PrPP1/R4RK1 b - -',?? White started to lose his composure. Relatively best is 15.g4 (15.Rfe1 Re1; 16.Re1 Na5 and 15.Be5 Ne5; 16.fe5 Qa6! with advantage for Black) Bg4; 16.hg4 Qf4 and the position is unclear. Black has compensation for the piece but probably not more than that.
553,19,20,1Qxf4,b'r5k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2p4b/1bN2q2/1Q3N1P/PB1PrPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Taking the pawn while increasing pressure against Nf3 and d2. I think Black is winning here. Time spent: 24 minutes (I usually start to play slowly when I feel the position is critical)
554,19,21,1Ne1,b'r5k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2p4b/1bN2q2/1Q5P/PB1PrPP1/R3NRK1 b - -',? This is just too passive to be good. Now the game is turning into a rout. Computer analysis suggests 16.Rac1 but then obvious and simple 16...Bf3; 17.Qf3 Qf3; 18.gf3 b5; 19.a3 bc4; 20.ab4 Rd2 wins for Black. It is hard to find anything better though.
555,19,22,1b5,b'r5k1/p4ppp/2n5/1pp4b/1bN2q2/1Q5P/PB1PrPP1/R3NRK1 w - b6',! Hitting the Nc4 and taking more space on the queenside with tempi.

557,19,24,1Rd8,b'3r2k1/p4ppp/2n5/1p5b/1bp2q2/4N2P/PB1PrPP1/R2QNRK1 w - -',Bringing the last inactive piece to the fight. There is no need to hurry since White has no counterplay. Time spent: 45 minutes

Black equalised easily with a well-played opening. 2. White allowed his role as a favourite to affect his judgement avoiding best continuation only because it is potentially drawish. This happens often and is usually a good chance for an alert underdog. 3. White was not sufficiently psychologically prepared to handle Black's initiative missing few crucial moves in a delicate position. This is connected to the second point. 4. The Queen manoeuvre is very typical and should be remembered. This motive appears relatively often and should be ""seen"" rather than calculated. --- Thank you for looking over this game I can answer any questions on private. Regards Marin Vukusic"

820,30,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Attacking my pawn.

822,30,3,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black is clearly winning now because he controls all of the center and is more developed.
823,30,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The game is now equal because we are both developed with one piece.
824,30,5,Qd8,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',White now has forced checkmate coming up soon because he is better.
825,30,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I have now developed my bishop.
826,30,7,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppbpppp/8/8/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This move is good for the bishop because it gives him more spaces to go.

828,30,9,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This bishop wastes time and makes white better because it now has less spaces to go and because white has forced checkmate with Ne5 Bxd1 Bxf7#. That is what would have happened if I let my opponent fall into that trap but I didn't.
829,30,10,h3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B3b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The bishop needs to move from that square if it wants a future.
830,30,11,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N2b1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',White is still better even though he is down a pony and black's bishop can go to more places.
831,30,12,Qxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White will now win because he has 15 points of development and black has 0.
832,30,13,f6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/8/2B5/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Adding one to black's development and defending against checkmate.

834,30,15,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/pQpnp1pp/5p2/8/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',The happy pony can now run to the center where he can have fun.

838,31,0,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Introducing 2...e5!? so called budabest gambit. a really sharp counter-attacking opening which has some potential giving black an initiative for a pawn.
839,31,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Budabest declined. at this point I would say black has already at least equalized almost like gambiting without losing a pawn. Take a look of development.

842,31,4,1Bxf6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/n2p1B1p/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1P4P/5PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ -',Helps black queen to develop but there isnt much of a choise since e pawn would be gone.

844,31,6,Nc5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p2qp/2nPpp2/2P1P3/P1PB1QPP/5P2/R3K1NR w KQ -',No hurries in exchanging.
845,31,7,Raf8,b'5rk1/ppp3p1/3p2qp/2nPpr2/2P5/P1P1Q1PP/5P2/R3K1NR w KQ -',Every piece is in good use unlike whites pieces. Also the pawn position looks worse with white.
846,31,8,1Rh2,b'5rk1/ppp3p1/3p2qp/2nPpr2/2P5/P1P1Q1PP/5P1R/R3K1N1 b Q -',Sad to say but this is whites best defence move.

849,31,11,Qe4,b'6k1/ppp3p1/3p3p/2nPp3/2P1q3/P1P1Q1PP/1K2Nr2/R7 w - -',Cant take rook...
850,31,12,Nxe2,b'6k1/ppp3p1/3p3p/3Pp3/2P5/PKP4P/4n3/8 w - -',The game is materially won now.
851,31,13,Kf7,b'8/pp3k2/3P3p/1K2p3/8/P5pn/8/8 w - -',White resings. This proves that weakly played opening may be fatal even if the rest of the game would've been played well. watch your development!
852,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I'm pretty sure everyone who plays on this site regularly is familiar with gothicgirl. She is a true warrior and fine chess talent. She is also legendary for the number of games she has played - and that is no understatement. Gothicgirl is also a fine team captain and all around good blokette:) A few days ago abe66 contacted me - he had read many of my annotations and liked them so he asked me to annotate this game of his vs. gothicgirl. Evidently it was a sweet win for him because she had been getting the best of him as of late. So without further ado I dedicate this annotation to abe66 gothicgirl Caissa and the rest of you who love GameKnot. I hope you enjoy:)
853,32,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black employs the Philador Defense. I've always thought of Philador players as a truly demented bunch:) Black locks in his dark squared bishop and commits himself to a passive game. His hope is to counter-punch at the big center that white can obtain by playing 3. d4 followed by logical development.
854,32,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',!? Hmm....3. d4 or 3. Bc4 seem much stronger. I don't totally discredit this move as it develops but this is one of those situations where the Nb1 is best placed on c3 after c4 has been played. I mean why retard the c pawn for no reason? Maybe marin or ion can explain the dynamics of this move better than I. It just doesn't feel right to me at this juncture.
855,32,3,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO.
856,32,4,Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White gets her last minor developed to a good square and prepares to castle. She is enjoying the superior position at this point and is preparing to coordinate her offense.
857,32,5,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Down some developmental tempo black hurries to catch up and hastens 0-0.
858,32,6,h3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',?! There is no reason for white to fear 7...Bg4 here. My immediate thought is 7. Qd2 (preparing 0-0-0) Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Bg6 10. Nh4! and white has a strong attack. Having said that I do agree that 7. h3 secures the g4 square into white's real estate. I guess it just depends on how aggressive you want to be:)
859,32,7,b6,b'r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Consolidates c5 and gives the light squared bishop another option.
860,32,8,Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Gothicgirl and I may be thinking the same thing here. White can now castle either way (a nice option if you can get it) and may very well be thinking of a kingside assault. Notice the firepower she has pointed that way and since she is out-hitting d5 it just may be a good launching platform.
861,32,9,Bb7,b'r2qk2r/pbp1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',?! I didn't like this move for black. He makes a premature commitment in my opinion. With all of the ammo white has pointed at his kingside I feel it is better to keep this bishop on a closer diagonal. I see the idea of him playing 0-0-0 but it seems to me that this move is a little slow. 8...Be3 9. BxB fxB should not be dismissed out of hand because of the doubled pawns. They would be central and black would have an early bead on the f file after 0-0.
862,32,10,O-O-O,b'r2qk2r/pbp1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R b kq -',Not content to wait around for black to tip his hand white castles long and prepares for kingside action.
863,32,11,Qd7,b'r3k2r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R w kq -',OK - 0-0-0 it will be. These two players are going to be slugging it out on the kingside.
864,32,12,1Kb1,b'r3k2r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/1K1R3R b kq -',Curious. I can only wonder what this was all about. 10. Nh4! would have been sweet as it puts the Nf3 one step closer to the natural outpost on f5 AND hastens f4!
865,32,13,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/1K1R3R w - -',As planned but not best right now as black's f pawn is hanging. What about 10...Na5!? which would instigate a favorable trade getting rid of whites strong light squared bishop? 
866,32,14,1g4,b'2kr3r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1P2/1K1R3R b - g3',White doesn't take the free f pawn. Instead she starts pushing the kingside. Good idea but I still like the idea of playing Nh4 first.
867,32,15,1a6,b'2kr3r/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Prevents intrusion on b5.

869,32,17,1Rhf8,b'2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPBN1P/1PPQ1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Black shores up the hanging f pawn. Was it the right rook? Most likely as the other one will be useful on the d file should conflict occur on the potentially volital g5 square.
870,32,18,1Nh2,b'2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPB2P/1PPQ1P1N/1K1R3R b - -',White is anxious to play f4 but I STILL like Nh4! C'mon gothicgirl! Go for the throat!
871,32,19,1b5,b'2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPB2P/1PPQ1P1N/1K1R3R w - -',Black makes his first truly aggressive move of the game and threatens white's powerful light squared bishop. That's the thing about the Philador - it usually is very passive early on but if black can weather the opening opportunities eventually arise.
872,32,20,1Ba2,b'2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/4P1P1/P1NPB2P/BPPQ1P1N/1K1R3R b - -',Validating white's 12th.

874,32,22,1f4,b'1nkr1r2/1bpqbpp1/p2p1n1p/1p2p3/4PPP1/P1NPB2P/BPPQ3N/1K1R3R b - f3',! White is ready to roll. Time to rev up the action.

Of course he wants to bring his Nb8 to c6 and he does have a strong pawn chain on the queenside but he is opening squares around his monarch and is basically daring white to attempt an attack at some point.
876,32,24,1fxe5,b'1nkr1r2/1b1qbpp1/p2p1n1p/1pp1P3/4P1P1/P1NPB2P/BPPQ3N/1K1R3R b - -',Quite an interesting choice. I would have figured gothicgirl would have simply pushed f5 and then concentrated on pushing her g and h pawns next. 
877,32,25,Nc6,b'2kr1r2/1b1qbpp1/p1n2n1p/1pp1p3/4P1P1/P1NPB2P/BPPQ3N/1K1R1R2 w - -',Getting this knight back into the game and re-establishing the threat of b4.

881,32,29,1b4,b'2kr1r2/1b1qbpp1/p1n4p/2pBp3/1p2P1P1/P2PB2P/1PPQ3N/1K1R1R2 w - -',! Black doesn't panic and goes for some space.
882,32,30,2a4,b'2kr1r2/1b1qbpp1/p1n4p/2pBp3/Pp2P1P1/3PB2P/1PPQ3N/1K1R1R2 b - -',? White panics a little. 20. axb Nxb 21. Bc4 and white still has good play. As played white may be giving black her a pawn as a target.
883,32,31,2Na5,b'2kr1r2/1b1qbpp1/p6p/n1pBp3/Pp2P1P1/3PB2P/1PPQ3N/1K1R1R2 w - -',Black looks to rid himself of white's pesky light squared bishop and eyes white's a pawn.
884,32,32,Qxb7,b'2kr1r2/1q2bpp1/p6p/n1p1p3/Pp2P1P1/3PB2P/1PPQ3N/1K1R1R2 w - -',?! Perhaps KxB with the idea of getting the Rd8 to c8 or B8 was stronger. 
885,32,33,2b3,b'2kr1r2/1q2bpp1/p6p/n1p1p3/Pp2P1P1/1P1PB2P/2PQ3N/1K1R1R2 b - -',Protecting the potential hole on c4.

White made a commitment much earlier to pushing the kingside and seems to have forgotten about it. Of course this move allows her to double up on the f file but I think pushing pawns would be more effective.
887,32,35,2f6,b'2kr1r2/1q2b1p1/p1n2p1p/2p1pR2/Pp2P1P1/1P1PB2P/2PQ3N/1K1R4 w - -',! Shutting down g5.

Now white's Rf5 has a little more scope and she may be able to push her e pawn.
891,32,39,2Qf2,b'2kr1r2/1q2b1p1/p4p1p/2p2R2/Pp1pP1P1/1P1P3P/2P2Q1N/1K3R2 b - -',Qe2 or Re1 should also be considered as either would reinforce an e pawn push.

894,32,42,2h4,b'2kr1r2/1q6/p2b1ppp/2p5/Pp1pP1PP/1P1P1R2/2P2Q1N/1K3R2 b - -',White doesn't fall for it and continues to push the kingside.

909,32,57,4Qe6,b'1k6/8/p1r1qpp1/4b2p/PpNpP2P/1P1P1R2/1K6/5Q2 w - -',Black regains a strong position as f6 is now amply protected from the threat of NxB.
910,32,58,Bg3,b'1k6/8/p1r1qpp1/7p/PpNpP2P/1P1P2b1/1K3R2/5Q2 w - -',? This move only assists white. Consider 42. Rg2 which attacks a piece that would be tough to protect and also threatens black's g pawn.
911,32,59,4Rc2,b'1k6/8/p1r1qpp1/7p/PpNpP2P/1P1P2b1/1KR5/5Q2 b - -',? White missed her chance to regain material equality.

914,32,62,4g5,b'1k6/8/p1r1qp2/6pp/PpNpP2b/1P1P4/1KR5/6Q1 w - -',Black protects both his g pawn and bishop and starts the race up the board on the kingside.

917,32,65,4e5,b'1kq5/8/p1r2p2/4P1pp/PpNQ3b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',As white has strength in the center she decides to push it. She certainly must worry about black's connected outside passers of course but if she can control the initiative she may just be able to force the issue down the middle. I like black better here but he is by no means out of the woods.
918,32,66,4f5,b'1kq5/8/p1r5/4Pppp/PpNQ3b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',Black pushes his own advantage and plans to win the pawn race. At this point it is not necessarily a race to promotion but a race to the threat of promotion. If black can divert white's pieces over to the kingside to defend he should be able to press his pawn advantage.
919,32,67,4e6,b'1kq5/8/p1r1P3/5ppp/PpNQ3b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',? Blunder. 46. Re2 g4 47. Nd6 and white has much better chances.
920,32,68,4Qxe6,b'1k6/8/p1r1q3/5ppp/PpNQ3b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',The correct capture. If 46...Rxe then 47. Nd6 QxR  48. KxQ.
921,32,69,4Qh8+,b'1k5Q/8/p1r1q3/5ppp/PpN4b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',Wins the h pawn. White is now valiantly fighting to regain the initiative.
922,32,70,4Kc7,b'7Q/2k5/p1r1q3/5ppp/PpN4b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',? Rc8 was the far better move. 47...Rc8 48. Qxh Qf6  49. Ka2 and black maintains his initiative.
923,32,71,4Qxh5,b'8/2k5/p1r1q3/5ppQ/PpN4b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',This is such a twisted game. Both players are having good ideas but acting on them too prematurely. Better for white was 48. Qh7  Kb8 THEN 49. Qxh Qf6  Kb1. With the black king further removed from it's pieces it would make an easier target to check in the future. Now black has some tempo to force the issue.
924,32,72,4Qh7+,b'8/2k4Q/p1r1q3/6p1/PpN2p1b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',The white rook is so incredibly passive right now. It was probably better to get him into play by the tempo gaining 49. Re2 (it would be safe from capture because it would have been protected by the white queen.)
925,32,73,4Kd8,b'3k4/7Q/p1r1q3/6p1/PpN2p1b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',? Kb8 would be an easier position to defend. Black has the wonderful threat of pushing the kingside but is allowing white too many check threats. Better to just suck it up waste a move if needed to secure his king and then let the fireworks start by pushing the kingside.
926,32,74,5Qb7,b'3k4/1Q6/p1r1q3/6p1/PpN2p1b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 b - -',? White is losing touch with reality (sorry gg:) Her rook is just screaming to get into the game and while she targets the black b pawn valuable time is being wasted that will allow black to roll up the kingside.
927,32,75,5Rc7,b'3k4/1Qr5/p3q3/6p1/PpN2p1b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',? Black joins white in La La Land (sorry Charlie:) Be1 protects the b pawn and hastens Bc3  and the text only threatens the queen that was moving anyway.
928,32,76,Qf6+,b'3k4/2r5/p4q2/6p1/PQN2p1b/1P1P4/1KR5/8 w - -',Black emerges from his fog and rightfully gets things into gear.
929,32,77,5Ka2,b'3k4/2r5/p4q2/6p1/PQN2p1b/1P1P4/K1R5/8 b - -',Interesting choice. Qc3 may have been better as it would encourage a queen swap. White's defensive priorities would be cut drastically to just stopping the black pawn advance. The text is not all together bad however as it puts the king on the opposite color of the black bishop.
930,32,78,5f3,b'3k4/2r5/p4q2/6p1/PQN4b/1P1P1p2/K1R5/8 w - -',Black has had enough and commits to winning straight away.
931,32,79,5Qg8,b'6Q1/2rk4/p4q2/6p1/P1N4b/1P1P1p2/K1R5/8 b - -',White ignores the promotion threat and sets up another check threat.
932,32,80,5Qd5+,b'8/2rk4/p4q2/3Q2p1/P1N4b/1P1P4/K1R2p2/8 b - -',? hmm....55. Qh7  Kc8 56. Qg8  Kd7 57. Qh7  Kc8 58. Qg8  Kd7 and white is right in it.
933,32,81,5Re2+,b'8/2r1k3/p4q2/3Q2p1/P1N4b/1P1P4/K3Rp2/8 b - -',White FINALLY gets the rook involved. Now she MUST keep up the check pressure to avoid black getting another queen.
934,32,82,5Ne3,b'Q7/2r3k1/p4q2/6p1/P6b/1P1PN3/K3Rp2/8 b - -',White's poor rook is so passive. This knight move was the only real possibility to snag the promoter.
935,32,83,5Rc1,b'Q7/6k1/p4q2/6p1/P6b/1P1PN3/K3Rp2/2r5 w - -',? Black continues to give white too much hope. Better to just promote take the knight and start nailing the coffin shut.
936,32,84,5Qb7+,b'8/1Q4k1/p4q2/6p1/P6b/1P1PN3/K3Rp2/2r5 b - -',White continues to hang on. At first glance black appears to be clearly ahead. I ran this position through Shredder and got the most fascinating line that I wanted to share here: [ 59. Nf5  Kh7 (59...QxN 60. Re7  Qf7 61. RxQ  KxR 62. Qd5  Kf6 63. Qd4  Kg6 64. Qe4  Kf6 65.

QxR Kg6] Now I find absolutely no fault with gothicgirl's last move - I mean there is little possibility that a fellow human of non-titled strength could have seen that sequence. I just it was too pretty not to mention:) As it is white is taking advantage of the reprieve black has given her and continues to keep up what little pressure she can in this position.
937,32,85,6Qg4+,b'8/8/p4q2/6pk/P5Qb/1P1PN3/K3Rp2/2r5 b - -',White keeps finding ways to hang on!
938,32,86,6Nf5+,b'8/8/p4q1k/5Np1/P5Qb/1P1P4/K3Rp2/2r5 b - -',! Yeah baby! White sees the chance to get her rook in on the action!
939,32,87,6Qxf5,b'8/8/p6k/5qp1/P5Qb/1P1P4/K3Rp2/2r5 w - -',Once again black has had enough of this and pins his hopes on the promotion on f1.
940,32,88,6Qxf5,b'8/8/p6k/5Qp1/P6b/1P1P4/K3Rp2/2r5 b - -',?? NO! Re6 ! saves the game! Follow this line: 63. Re6  QxR 64. QxQ Kh5 65. Qe2  Kh6 66. Qe6  Kh5 67. Qe2  Kh6 68. Qe6 . 
941,32,89,6f1=Q,b'8/8/p6k/5Qp1/P6b/1P1P4/K3R3/2r2q2 w - -',Black now has the goods and must simply evade a few annoying checks.
942,32,90,Kh1,b'8/8/p7/6p1/P3R1Qb/1P1P4/K7/2r2q1k w - -',Black is now temporarily safe from check.
943,32,91,6Ka3,b'8/8/p7/6p1/P3R1Qb/KP1P4/8/2r2q1k b - -',White is out of ideas. Black now pours on the pain.
944,32,92,Be1+,b'5q2/8/p7/6p1/P3R1Q1/1PKP4/8/r3b2k w - -',With this bishop now in the game and controlling dark squares white is seriously on the ropes.
945,32,93,7Ke5,b'8/5q2/p7/4K1p1/P3R1Q1/1P1P4/8/r3b2k b - -',?? White's best chance was 74. Kc6 Rc1  75. Rc4 Qf6  76. Kb7 RxR 77. dxR
946,32,94,7Bc3+,b'8/5q2/p7/4K1p1/P3R1Q1/1PbP4/8/r6k w - -',Very workable but Bg3  wins as if the bishop is taken black wins the white queen after Qc7 .

948,32,96,7Kf5,b'8/4q3/p7/5Kp1/P2PR1Q1/1Pb5/8/r6k b - -',?? Yikes! What about 76. Kd5 Qf7  Kc6?????? Black now marks a '1' on the wall chart.
949,32,97,Rg6,b'8/6q1/p5r1/8/P2PR1Q1/1Pb3K1/8/7k w - -',And white has had enough. I thought was a thoroughly entertaining game. Both sides made mistakes of course but it was interesting to me how the outcome was not decided until very late - after both sides had squandered chances yet were let off of the hook almost immediately by their opponent. I replayed it a few times just to watch how the tempo and initiative kept passing back and forth. I felt like I was at a tennis match:) I take nothing away from these two fine players and I hope my annotation did not appear harsh. It's always so much easier to armchair quarterback someone else's game when you have the benefit of an engine:) Many thanks to abe66 and gothicgirl for the game and I hope you have enjoyed it:) - Thomas
950,33,0,3Nd2,b'2b5/6b1/4k3/8/8/4K3/3N4/8 b - -',This is not a very common endgame but it could easily happen in one of your games. A lot of players don't have the technique to win this but even if you never get an endgame like this the main reason I'm showing this endgame is to better understand how to attack the king with two bishops on a wide open board.
951,33,1,Ba6+,b'8/8/b3k2b/8/8/3K4/3N4/8 w - -',In the middlegame two bishops are usually strongest when controlling adjacent diagonals. In wide open games where control of precise squares is critical another technique of using the bishop pair is to criss-cross them since they take away a lot of squares from the enemy king White is forced to head closer to the edge on the queenside
952,33,2,Bg7+,b'8/6b1/b3k3/8/8/2K5/3N4/8 w - -',The criss-crossing cornering method is demonstrated again. White will be cornered toward the a1-corner or the a8-corner depending on which direction White runs in.
953,33,3,Bd3,b'8/6b1/8/3k4/1K6/3b4/3N4/8 w - -',Once the criss-cross method has been used to take away a group of squares from the king the bishops can use the adjacent-diagonal method to maintain the restriction of the king while your king gets into another position where you can use the criss-cross method to push the enemy king back further.
954,33,4,3Nb3,b'8/6b1/8/3k4/1K6/1N1b4/8/8 b - -',White wants the knight close by the king since the knight will be trapped if it ventures off into the range of the bishops (which is what Black is aiming for). Also if White moves his knight out into the range of the bishops Black can get cornering tempos while attacking the knight.
955,33,5,3Bg6,b'8/6b1/6b1/3k4/1K6/1N6/8/8 w - -',This ending will also show the bishops' advantages to be able to waste moves. White's king and knight cannot waste moves so the bishops will be able to zugswang them into the corner until the knight is forced away from the king and will get killed in the attacking ranges of the bishops
956,33,6,Bf6,b'8/8/5bb1/1K1k4/8/1N6/8/8 w - -',Black wants to play the restricting Be7
957,33,7,Bh4,b'8/8/6b1/3k4/1K5b/1N6/8/8 w - -',"Black wants to use the criss-cross cornering method with Be1 
After Kc3 Be1  White is forced close to a1 since Nd2 Kc5 zugswang would hang the knight.
Kb5 allows the restricting Be7 so Black can make progress in all scenarios."
958,33,8,Bh5,b'8/8/8/N2k3b/1K5b/8/8/8 w - -',This is a very important move. The bishops want to get to e2 and e1 to force the king closer to the corner and this is also a waiting move since certain moves by White will allow cornering progress that wasn't able to be made this move. Like if Kb5 or Ka4 then Be8 forces the king down since moving back to b4 allows Be1  winning the knight.
959,33,9,3Nb3,b'8/8/8/3k3b/1K5b/1N6/8/8 b - -',Kc3 hangs the knight and other king moves give Black cornering tempos by either checks or attacking the knight. Nb3 also gives Black cornering tempos but White is lost in all variations.
960,33,10,Be2+,b'8/8/8/1K1k4/8/1N6/4b3/4b3 w - -',White must choose which corner to die in. If Ka4 then Black corners the king easily with 41...Bd1 42.Ka3 Kc4 (attacking the knight) and there is an invisible forcefield restricting White's king to the rectangle of c1-c4-a4-a1 where it is easy to get White into zugswang from there.
961,33,11,4Na5,b'8/8/1K1k4/N7/8/8/4b3/4b3 b - -',"If White doesn't get his knight and king close together then the bishops will keep harassing the knight and taking away its flight squares until it is trapped.
Nc5 loses to Bf2"
962,33,12,Bd4,b'8/1K6/3k4/N7/3b4/8/4b3/8 w - -',This waiting move forces White to allow something Black couldn't have done last move. White moving his king allows Black to tighten the barrier more.
963,33,13,Bc3,b'8/1K6/3k4/8/8/1Nb5/4b3/8 w - -',"This takes away the knight's flight square and Black is threatening to trap the knight with Bc4 and the knight's escape squares will be guarded if it's on c1 so one threat by the non-restricting bishop wins the knight.
Kb6 is needed to stop the knight winning threat"
964,33,14,4Na5,b'8/8/1K1k4/N7/2b5/2b5/8/8 b - -',If Nc1 then one threat by the dark-squared bishop wins the knight.
965,33,15,Be6,b'8/1K6/3kb3/N7/3b4/8/8/8 w - -',This restricts the c8-square and White is forced to allow Black to make progress.
966,33,16,4Ka6,b'8/8/K2kb3/N7/3b4/8/8/8 b - -',Kb8 allows the Bb6 cornering tempo while Nc6 Bd5 loses the knight.

50.N(not d6) Bc8  51.Nb7 Kc4 zugswangs the king away from defending the knight."
969,33,19,Bc5,b'8/8/K2Nb3/2b5/1k6/8/8/8 w - -',Black can just simply attack the knight. If Nb7 then Bc4#. Moving the knight to a square that isn't b7 allows Bc8# so White has lost the knight. If White had tried moving the knight away earlier then Black could simply trap the knight using the bishops on the open board.
970,33,20,5Kb7,b'8/1K6/3Nb3/2b5/1k6/8/8/8 b - -',This is the only move that doesn't get mated next move but White has lost the knight giving Black an easily won game

A line I'm not particularly familiar playing but havent experienced much difficulty combatting in my past games. Without knowledge of the variations I'd assess that this line is fairly easy for white to maintain the first move advantage well into the middlegame.
975,34,3,Nxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',next few moves are standard. To provide a brief explanation white first move advantage denies black from an immediate recapture owing to the threat of Qe2. Once black recaptures the pawn via his knight white stakes a claim for the center. And black does likewise. From here its a race to castle with white aiming to pressurise blacks advanced knight whilst simultaneously developing pieces into active positions. Black is likewise aiming to develop and castle as quickly as possible.

"
1027,35,0,2Ra2,b'8/6K1/3bk3/8/5r2/8/R7/8 b - -',This is the starting position of the endgame study just ignore all the moves before this. In the case of a lone rook vs. a rook and bishop the game is usually a draw. In this case Black can win this game because White's king is under attack by Black's remaining pieces. If White's king was in the center or Black's pieces weren't well coordinated then White can fight and get a draw.
1028,35,1,2Be5+,b'8/6K1/4k3/4b3/5r2/8/R7/8 w - -',It's important that Black keep the pressure on the king before the White rook can come in to try to save the king. Studying winning endgames with a slim amount of material is a good way to improve your overall endgame and work better with your pieces. Even in positions that are draws a lot of players suck at endgames and you can outplay them for the win.
1029,35,2,3Kh6,b'8/8/4k2K/4b3/5r2/8/R7/8 b - -',Black's job is to use his rook to get White's king trapped on one rank or file of the board (the 8th rank 1st rank h-file or a-file). The bishop defends the king against possible rook checks while also combining in the attack against the king. It doesn't matter where White moves Rg4 seals the king's escape route in any case.
1030,35,3,3Re2,b'8/8/4k2K/4b3/6r1/8/4R3/8 b - -',White's best chance to draw is to pin the bishop here because after moves that are not Kf5 White can disrupt the Black attack and escape into a drawn position Kf5 secures the win by not letting White's rook disrupt the attack
1031,35,4,Bf4+,b'8/8/7K/5k2/5br1/8/5R2/8 w - -',The bishop demonstrates it's power to both defend and attack. Bishops show their full power in extremely open positions like this. White has a much better chance of drawing if the bishop was a knight since knights aren't as powerful in open positions. 
1032,35,5,3Kh7,b'8/7K/8/5k2/5br1/8/5R2/8 b - -',White would lose quicker after 33.Kh5 because Rg1 threatens mate with Rh1 thanks to the bishop cutting off White's escape. White would have to sacrifice his rook for Black's bishop to stop immediate mate but a king and rook vs. a king is a very simple win.
1033,35,6,3Kf6,b'8/7K/5k2/8/5br1/8/5R2/8 w - -',In this position Black threatens to play Kf7 and White's king is dead because of the Rh4 threat. White's rook needs to get to a square where Black can be checked after Kf7.
1034,35,7,3Rb2,b'8/7K/5k2/8/5br1/8/1R6/8 b - -',Now Kf7 would draw because Rb7  disrupts Black's attack.
1035,35,8,Rg1,b'7K/8/5k2/8/5b2/8/1R6/6r1 w - -',The winning process is complicated but it gets simpler once you reach a key position explained later. Black's rook effectively restricts White to the h-file but it needed to be moved because of White's Rb6  threat that wins the Black rook and then it's Black who is fighting for the draw. Now that the rook serves its purpose restricting the king it's time for the bishop and king to position accurately to reach the key position.
1036,35,9,3Rf2,b'7K/8/5k2/8/5b2/8/5R2/6r1 b - -',White's rook needs to be as annoying as possible to make Black work the hardest for the win otherwise Black has an easier time setting up the key position.
1037,35,10,3Rg4,b'7K/8/5k2/8/5br1/8/5R2/8 w - -',"Other ways of defending the bishop disrupt Black's formation. Defending with the rook still restricts the White king without having to change the position of the king and bishop. If you ask ""why not just play Rg4 immediately instead of Rg1?"" then the answer is that the position of White's rook makes a huge difference in the position and how Black needs to finish the attack. Black has to make sure that the rook isn't in a position to mess up his formation and it takes a lot of patience. "
1038,35,11,3Rb2,b'7K/8/5k2/8/5br1/8/1R6/8 b - -',Black was threatening Kf7 which would've mated White very quickly so White puts the rook in a position to mess up Black's formation if Black tries Kf7.
1039,35,12,3Be3,b'7K/8/5k2/8/6r1/4b3/1R6/8 w - -',This bishop move prevents any rook checks while also getting one step closer to reaching the key position. If all of this seems complicated to you don't worry this is a very complicated endgame and studying it and reviewing it will help you to play endgames like this and using the ideas will improve your overall endgame even if it doesn't seem like it will.
1040,35,13,Re4,b'7K/8/5k2/8/4r3/1R2b3/8/8 w - -',In this position Black wants to play Kg6 with a quick Re8 mate in mind. The bishop is excellent in stopping rook checks and White's king is still cornered despite the rook's absence on the g-file. 
1041,35,14,3Rc3,b'7K/8/5k2/8/4r3/2R1b3/8/8 b - -',This move makes Black's win the most complicated since the rook threatens a check. Ra3 also threatens a check but Black mates quickly with Kf7 and the bishop defends the rook check. Rb1 is another move that threatens a rook check but Kg6 stops the rook check and Black has an easier time setting up the key position.
1042,35,15,3Bf4,b'7K/8/5k2/8/4rb2/2R5/8/8 w - -',This critical move defends the c7 and g3 squares so now Black can play Kg6 or Kf7 against a passive move which heavily increases the pressure on White's king while not allowing rook checks.
1043,35,16,4Ra3,b'7K/8/5k2/8/4rb2/R7/8/8 b - -',White must make Black work for the win so he threatens potential rook checks on the a-file. 
1044,35,17,4Re8+,b'4r2K/8/5k2/8/5b2/R7/8/8 w - -',If White had tried Rc8 a move ago preventing this check then Kf7 wins easily and Black just needs to find a quick mate.
1045,35,18,Be5,b'4r3/7K/5k2/4b3/8/R7/8/8 w - -',When a king is trapped on a back rank or rook file then the bishop is usually strongest when it's on the central rank or file corresponding to the rank or file the king is trapped on. For example if the king was trapped on the a-file then the bishop would be strongest on the d-file. If the king was trapped on the 1st rank then the bishop is strongest on the 4th rank. The key position of this endgame is where your king is on the 3rd rank 6th rank c-file or f-file in front of the bishop and Black is threatening to acheive the key position
1046,35,19,4Ra2,b'4r3/7K/5k2/4b3/8/8/R7/8 b - -',"Other defensive attempts lose faster.
Ra6  allows Kf5 reaching the key position where White cannot effectively stop Rh8#.
Rf3  allows Kg5 where White still cannot effectively stop Rh8#
Ra7 allows Kf5 where Black reaches the key position and I'll explain the winning process later when Black forces White into the key position. White can still stall Black's win for longer with the move played since 43.Rf2  is threatened if 43...Kf5 is played drawing the game since Black's formation is disrupted."

1049,35,22,4Kh8,b'7K/6r1/5k2/4b3/8/8/R7/8 b - -',This position is a demonstration of where the attacker's pieces are the strongest in this endgame. The bishop is strongest on a central rank or file while the king is strongest 2 ranks or files away from the edge and the rook is strongest one rank or file from the edge since it restricts the king to the back rank.
1050,35,23,4Rg1,b'7K/8/5k2/4b3/8/8/R7/6r1 w - -',This patient move is necessary because it unstalemates White's king. If it had been White to move in the previous position then White could draw with perpetual check since taking the rook is stalemate.
1051,35,24,4Rf2+,b'7K/8/5k2/4b3/8/8/5R2/6r1 b - -',"Once again checks by the defender make it a little harder for the attacker to acheive the key position and win.

1052,35,25,Bd6,b'6K1/8/3b2k1/8/8/8/5R2/6r1 w - -',"This is a very important position of this endgame and remembering the concepts is complicated like in the key position but the key position is more likely to occur. This position is rare but if you remember it then you can automatically know you're winning if you reach this position on your opponent's turn. The special thing about this position is that the player to move decides the game. This position (and mirror images of it) aren't hard positions to memorize but you don't even need to memorize it if you can logically see how both sides would be in zugswang if it was their turn to move. If it was Black's move here then the position is drawn because Black cannot make a move without disrupting his formation. No matter where Black moves he'll be allowing the White rook access to a square that was guarded before. In this case White is the one in zugswang since it is White to move here. No matter where White moves he will unguard a critical square or set of squares.
47.Rf3 would take away the Rg2  potential checking idea so Black can play Rc1 with unstoppable mate since the rook no longer has a check.
47.Rf7 would take away the Kf7 potential escape path so play could continue Kh6  Kh8 Be5 
47.Kh8 would also take away the Kf7 potential escaping route so play could continue Re1 (threatening mate) Rg2  Kh6 Kg8 Rf1 (threatening unstoppable mate)
To avoid these quick mates the rook must move along the 2nd rank allowing the Black king access to the f-file."
1053,35,26,Be5,b'6K1/8/5k2/4b3/8/8/3R4/7r w - -',It doesn't seem as though Black has made much progress but Black is closer to forcing White to play into the key position. Every move counts and one slight error could change a winning position into a drawn position. Since the key corner of this variant of the RB vs. R endgame is h8 the bishop's key square of the key position is e5 you'll understand later.

1056,35,29,5Bd4,b'8/7K/5k2/8/3b4/8/R7/6r1 w - -',This critical bishop move is to stop Rf2  which would disrupt Black's attack and draw the game.

1062,35,35,5Kf6,b'r7/7K/5k2/7R/3b4/8/8/8 w - -',Black's idea is to get his king to f7 and bishop to f6 to seal in White and force the key position.
1063,35,36,5Rb5,b'r7/7K/5k2/1R6/3b4/8/8/8 b - -',This stalls the key position longest simply because the rook is most active here. Other moves allow White to force the key position faster

1065,35,38,5Be5,b'8/r7/5k1K/1R2b3/8/8/8/8 w - -',In the Kg8 variation where the king is trapped on the 8th rank the key position is reached with the Black king on e6 but in this variation with the king restricted to the h-file the Black king should be on f5 in the key position.
1066,35,39,Kf5,b'8/r7/1R5K/4bk2/8/8/8/8 w - -',Finally a form of the key position has been reached after all that time and effort spent by Black. The key corner is the corner the defending king has been trapped on for the entire ending. In the key position the bishop should be on the square three diagonal spaces from the key corner and the attacking king should be next to the bishop as shown in this position based on which side of the board the defending king decides to get trapped on.

The bishop's control of g7 and g3 make the mate threat effective and White's king is trapped."
1069,35,42,6Rb4,b'8/8/8/4bk1K/1R6/8/8/r7 b - -',This is the only way to stop mate
1070,35,43,6Rg1,b'8/8/8/4bk1K/1R6/8/8/6r1 w - -',"This position is another form of the key position where your pieces are on their key squares corresponding where the enemy king is trapped and the enemy king cannot move because of mate threats. Looking at this position should tell you how to determine the key squares for your pieces based on which back rank the enemy is trapped on.
The winning process of the key position consists of getting the White rook in zugswang so that it can no longer defend against mate. The White king is already trapped so now we focus on the enemy rook."
1071,35,44,6Ra4,b'8/8/8/4bk1K/R7/8/8/6r1 b - -',The rook must move along the 4th rank to maintain the defense against Rh1 . If White tries 61.Rh4 then the rook is too passively placed to defend against newly created mate threats so Black wins by threatening mate with 61...Rg8
1072,35,45,6Rg7,b'8/6r1/8/4bk1K/R7/8/8/8 w - -',Now Black has another mate threat which can only be defended by Ra6. Black's array of mate threats help to eventually put White in zugswang.
1073,35,46,6Ra6,b'8/6r1/R7/4bk1K/8/8/8/8 b - -',There are different ways Black can win based on how White plays the ending. If White tries 62.Kh6 then Black's array of mate threats continue starting with 62...Rg8 63.Ra7 Rg3 64.Rf7 (if 64.Kh7 then Rh3  Kg8 Rh8  Kf7 Rh7  wins the rook) 64...Bf6 (Black's threatening Rh3#) 65.Kh7 Rh3  66.Kg8 Rh8#
1074,35,47,6Bc7,b'8/2b3r1/R7/5k1K/8/8/8/8 w - -',The next step of zugswanging the rook is to make a waste-move with the bishop while preventing the rook from checking.

65.Ra4 Bd8 66.Kh6 Rd7 and there is no effective defense against 67...Bg5  68.Kh5 Rh7 "
1076,35,49,6Bf4,b'8/6r1/2R5/5k1K/5b2/8/8/8 w - -',Notice how ever since the key position was reached Black's moves have mostly been mate threats eventually turning into a forced mate. At the beginning of this endgame study Black had an in-depth forced mate taking 50 moves to carry out. All White can do is play moves that stall the mate the longest.
1077,35,50,Be5,b'8/6r1/8/2R1bk1K/8/8/8/8 w - -',"This key position is probably the easiest to remember.
If White plays Kh6 then Rg8 has the deadly threat of Rh8 "
1078,35,51,Rg5+,b'8/8/2R5/4bkrK/8/8/8/8 w - -',Now begins the process of pushing the enemy king toward a square where the enemy rook no longer has a move to stop back rank mate. If White plays Kh4 here then Rg2 has the deadly threat of Rh2#
1079,35,52,Rg1,b'8/8/2R4K/4bk2/8/8/8/6r1 w - -',The rook can also move to g2 or g3 since all three moves create the Rh1 mate threat
1080,35,53,Rd7,b'8/3r4/2R4K/4bk2/8/8/8/8 w - -',This important move threatens Bf4  forced mate and White's only defense is to pin the bishop. White has to give up the rook to stop mate and Black wins easily.
1081,35,54,Rd8,b'3r4/8/7K/2R1bk2/8/8/8/8 w - -',Now after all those mate threats and careful calculations and tactics Black has finally won. There is no way White can stop Rh8# without giving up his rook. Playing this endgame takes extreme precision and complicated analysis. Getting this endgame is rare but the concepts and ideas mentioned here can help in other endgames involving rooks and bishops. I will probably make some more endgame studies after this.

1086,36,4,Ng6,b'rn6/p7/1p3Qnk/3Pp1p1/2P1Pp2/1PN5/P3B1K1/8 w - -',You have to admit my opponent played out this position very well.
1087,36,5,4Qxb6+,b'7r/8/1Q4k1/3Pp1p1/1nP1Pp2/1PN5/P5K1/8 b - -',and black resigns!
1088,37,0,Kb2,b'8/8/2K5/3N4/8/7p/1k5N/8 w - -',This is the starting position in the desired endgame I would like to study and demonstrate to you. It is White's move here and there are loads of players who would just offer a draw here as White. King and two knights vs. lone king is known to be a dead draw so if you ever get close to reaching this two knights endgame you should keep one of your opponent's pawns on the board because it is possible to mate with two knights if your opponent has remaining material and you have the technique to win (like I will show you).
1089,37,1,4Kc5,b'8/8/8/2KN4/8/7p/1k5N/8 b - -',White has a forced win (that will take many many moves). Black's pawn close to promotion on the h-file is a traitor because without it the position would be dead drawn. Two knights can usually win against a king and pawn if the pawn's promotion is blocked and sufficiently far from promotion (in this case 2 squares is far enough but it usually isn't) and the losing king isn't close to helping the pawn.
1090,37,2,4Kb3,b'8/8/8/2KN4/8/1k5p/7N/8 w - -',Black is fighting for a draw so it's logical that he would want to try restricting the attacking king from coming in but this just stalls White's win. It's up to Black to make it as hard as possible for White to win.
1091,37,3,4Kb5,b'8/8/8/1K1N4/8/1k5p/7N/8 b - -',White forces the enemy king back with opposition and with the help of the knight. The other knight is a blockade to prevent pawn promotion. That knight will move later and allow a pawn move so that the black king won't be stalemated when the knights focre checkmate.
1092,37,4,4Kc2,b'8/8/8/1K1N4/8/7p/2k4N/8 w - -',Black wants to get toward the pawn and attack the blockader. It is pretty much the only hope for a draw. 
1093,37,5,4Kc4,b'8/8/8/3N4/2K5/7p/2k4N/8 b - -',It is important to have an agressive king in and endgame especially when your opponent has minimal material. White's king is the most powerful piece on the board where it restricts Black's movement. White's three pieces must cooperate accurately to win this. White has an offensive knight and a defensive knight. The offensive knight helps the king to restrict the enemy king's breathing space while the defensive knight simply blockades the pawn and then comes in later to complete the final mating maneuver.
1094,37,6,4Ne3,b'8/8/8/8/3K4/4N2p/4k2N/8 b - -',This is a big decision for Black. Black can head toward the kingside and White will play Nef1 and there is no hope of Black's king breaking the blockade with both knights supporting each other. Black can stall the win longer by going to the queenside where there is more free space.
1095,37,7,4Nc4+,b'8/8/8/8/2NK4/7p/3k3N/8 b - -',If Black heads to the kingside toward the pawn with Ke2 then Ke4  Kf2 Nd2 and White can set up the supporting knights strategy to continue the pawn blockade.
1096,37,8,4Na5,b'8/8/8/N7/3K4/7p/2k4N/8 b - -',Restricting the king from b3. This time if Black keeps heading toward the queenside with Kb2 then Kd3 Ka3 Kc3 Ka4 Nb7 and the king will be pushed back toward White's territory and then pushed to the kingside. The reason the king needs to be pushed toward the pawn is because White has a knight sacrifice tactic later. where White mates with a lone knight.
1097,37,9,5Nd4,b'8/8/8/8/2KN4/7p/1k5N/8 b - -',The king and knight alone are able to restrict the enemy king until it is forced to get cornered on the kingside. The other knight comes in for the finish later.
1098,37,10,5Nb3,b'8/8/8/8/8/kNK4p/7N/8 b - -',The knight cornering method is complicated to master but the ideas will come in handy in knight endgames and especially in variants of this endgame.
1099,37,11,5Kc4,b'8/8/8/8/k1K5/1N5p/7N/8 b - -',The only winning move. Other moves allow the king to escape into a drawn position. 
1100,37,12,5Kd2,b'8/8/8/2N5/8/7p/1k1K3N/8 b - -',Cornering with a knight takes time and practice to do effectively and maneuvering must be precise. Opposition is the main idea of pushing the enemy king back (being two horizontal or vertical squares away from the defending king is the strongest)
1101,37,13,5Kc3,b'8/8/8/2N5/8/k1K4p/7N/8 b - -',Once again the only winning move. There are other variants of the last few previous positions that would've reached this position quicker. Pay attention to how the king and knight maneuver to control where the Black king is forced to move. White's goal is to get the black king toward the pawn where White has the sacrifice tactic.
1102,37,14,5Nd3,b'8/8/8/8/8/2KN3p/k6N/8 b - -',If Ka3 here then White plays the restricting Nb2. Now that Black's king has been effectively restricted in the corner White must figure out how to zugswang the king into having to move toward the pawn. Don't worry if the winning process seems complicated if you just play logical restricting moves and calculate ahead you should be able to manage a win.
1103,37,15,6Kc1,b'8/8/8/8/2N5/7p/7N/k1K5 b - -',Since kings and knights cannot waste moves White needs to have a good grasp of triangulation and opposition knowledge. Triangulation is when you make a series of moves that reaches almost the same position as before except that the other player has to move. If you learn this technique then you will have a better understanding of how to corner with a king and knight.
1104,37,16,6Nd2+,b'8/8/8/8/8/1K5p/3N3N/1k6 b - -',Finally White has made some progress in cornering Black's king. Black cannot play Ka1 here because play continues Nhf3 h2 Nd4 h1=Q Nc2#
1105,37,17,7Kd4,b'8/8/8/8/3K4/1N5p/4k2N/8 b - -',This is a very important restricting move. Black can draw if he gets to e3 where it is impossible to corner him from the center.
1106,37,18,7Nc1,b'8/8/8/8/3K4/7p/5k1N/2N5 b - -',"Here Ke1 is the move that stalls the win the longest but I will show this variation since most players would play this as Black attempting to break the knight blockade while the knights are not supporting each other.
So attacking the knight by moving the king to the g-file seem to draw the game right?"
1107,37,19,7Kg3,b'8/8/8/8/3K4/6kp/7N/2N5 w - -',How can White win now since the blockade has been broken?
1108,37,20,7Ke3,b'8/8/8/8/8/4K1kp/7N/2N5 b - -',White has this nice mating tactic where Black will lose quickly if he takes the knight. After Kxh2 play continues Kf2 Kh1 Ne2 Kh2 (h2 Ng3#) Nc3 Kh1 Ne4 Kh2 (h2 Ng3#) Nd2 Kh1 Nf1 h2 Ng3#
1109,37,21,7Kh4,b'8/8/8/8/7k/4K2p/7N/2N5 w - -',Kg2 also loses quickly because Ne2 maintains the sacrifice mating tactic (Ne2 Kxh2 Kf3 Kh1 Kf2 transposes into the line discussed before) and Black's king is completely restricted to the corner. White uses restriction to force Black to accept the knight sacrifice where White can use the brilliant 1-knight mating tactic which was once just a composed puzzle but now it serves a purpose in this endgame. If Black's pawn wasn't a rook pawn then it would have to be farther from promotion in order for White to still win since mating with 1 knight can only be done if the king is trapped behind a rook-pawn
1110,37,22,Kh6,b'8/8/7k/5K2/8/7p/7N/2N5 w - -',If Kh4 then Ne2 restricts the king to be pushed upward anyway
1111,37,23,7Ne2,b'8/7k/5K2/8/8/7p/4N2N/8 b - -',White's powerful knights and Black's traitor pawn restrict the enemy king from crossing a barrier Black's only hope of escaping is around the White king and back to the queenside.
1112,37,24,7Ke7,b'6k1/4K3/8/8/8/7p/4N2N/8 b - -',Here we are nearing the 50-move rule. On most online chess servers the 50-move rule is initiated and White would have to sadly settle for a draw but in competetive tournament play the 50-move rule can be exempted for special cases that require more than 50 moves to win. Usually your opponent's defense won't be perfect so there is still hope of winning in under 50 moves when playing online where the 50-move rule interferes with your win. If you are in an OTB tournament and you ever get a winning ending requiring more than 50 moves to win I highly encourage you to cause a scene if the tournament director won't allow you more than 50 moves to win. I think the 50-move rule is dumb because there is a famous position that requires almost 600 moves to force a win!
1113,37,25,7Kh7,b'8/4K2k/8/8/8/7p/4N2N/8 w - -',Kg7 allows White to win slightly quicker with Nf4 where White's opposition of the king allows Black to be cornered quicker. A lot of players would've played Kg7 cutting off time from White's winning sequence. A lot of inaccuracies by a human player can take lots of moves of your winning sequence and may allow you to finish in less than 50 moves in cases where extra time isn't allowed.
1114,37,26,Kh7,b'8/7k/5K2/8/8/7p/4N2N/8 w - -',If Kh5 then White tightens the barrier with a Nc3 Ne4 maneuver
1115,37,27,Kh6,b'8/8/5K1k/8/3N4/7p/7N/8 w - -',The finishing moves of this ending are usually the hardest to find. The cornering part at the beginning just required logical restricting moves. White now has to continue the restriction barrier into the h8-corner where White's h2-knight has sufficient moves to mate Black the same move the pawn promotes. Back when the king was cornered on a1 the knight wasn't close enough to force a mate but the h2-knight served a purpose when it restricted the a1-square with a mating threat.
1116,37,28,8Nf5+,b'8/8/5K1k/5N2/8/7p/7N/8 b - -',If Kh7 here then Kf7 corners the king more quickly.
1117,37,29,8Ne3,b'8/8/5K2/7k/8/4N2p/7N/8 b - -',"There are two totally different winning sequences.
If Black's plan is to move toward the h8-corner then White will win by stalemating the king on h8 the same move the h2-knight moves to give Black a legal pawn move then that knight will mate Black the same move the pawn promotes.
If Black's plan is to move toward the h1-corner then White will win by figuring a way to get his king to g3 the same move Black plays Kh1 so that White will have Nf2 h2 Nf2#"
1118,37,30,8Kh6,b'8/8/5K1k/8/8/4N2p/7N/8 w - -',This is Black's longest way of surviving since the knights are further from the h8-corner but regardless the knights are powerful enough to corner the king in either corner wherever Black flees.
1119,37,31,Kh7,b'8/7k/5K2/8/6N1/7p/7N/8 w - -',If Kh5 then Kf5 Kh4 Kg6 and White forces the king to h1 thanks to the powerful barrier restricting f3 f2 and f1. White would then need to get the king to g3 the same move the king is forced to h1 and then play Nf3 h2 Nf2#
1120,37,32,Kh8,b'7k/5K2/8/5N2/8/7p/7N/8 w - -',The king has been forcefully cornered so now White must figure out the mating sequence. There are certain squares the knights need to be on in order to complete the mating attack.
1121,37,33,Kf8,b'5k2/6N1/6K1/8/8/7p/7N/8 w - -',Kh8 loses quicker to Ne6 Kg8 Ng4!! where White has enough moves to mate Black on or before the move the pawn promotes
1122,37,34,Kh7,b'8/7k/4NK2/8/8/7p/7N/8 w - -',If Kh8 then Kg6 Kg8 Ng4!! reaching the same position discussed a couple moves ago.
1123,37,35,Kh7,b'8/5K1k/4N3/8/8/7p/7N/8 w - -',Now White has maneuvered the knight onto a square where a forced checkmating sequence can begin with the movement of the blockading knight.
1124,37,36,9Ng4,b'8/5K1k/4N3/8/6N1/7p/8/8 b - -',It takes a lot of foresight and extremely accurate play to win an endgame like this so hopefully these ideas will help you in your endgame. Even though this endgame took more than 50 moves to win White still had a forced win and most TD's will exempt the 50-move rule if you have the technique to win this. A lot of times the defenders's defense won't be well enough to make you take more than 50 moves especially in lower rated games.
1125,37,37,9h2,b'8/5K1k/4N3/8/6N1/8/7p/8 w - -',Kh8 loses just as fast after Nf6 h2 Nf4 h1=Q Ng6#.
1126,37,38,9Ng5+,b'8/5K1k/8/6N1/6N1/8/7p/8 b - -',Checking with this knight on g5 or f8 will win just as fast since the knight will be guarding h7 in either case the king will be stalemated in either case and the g4-knight can complete the same mating maneuver in either case.
1127,37,39,9Ne5,b'7k/5K2/8/4N1N1/8/8/7p/8 b - -',This is the final mating maneuver Black has been successfully cornered into a stalemated position where forced mate exists.
1128,37,40,9Ng6#,b'7k/5K2/6N1/6N1/8/8/8/7q b - -',This is a complicated endgame to study and mastering it is a lot more complicated than mastering the knight-bishop checkmate or the 2 bishops vs. 1 knight checkmate. Even though endings like this are rare just the ideas and concepts will help you in similar endings and using these tactical ideas will allow you to win logically in complicated endgames rather than memorizing billions of possible endgame piece placements and positions that are forced mate in over 100 moves. Extreme calculation and technique is the key to winning endgames and winning them will take time and effort so it's best to study endgames rather than openings since the simplicity of few pieces helps you better understand chess and improve your overall chess.
