Instead white tries playing 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 sacrificing a pawn for early development of the knight on b1. But I believe that this is not a huge advantage in development compared to the pawn lost.

You might think that this would be the right time to play 3. Bb5+ and for some people it is but Black has many choices with 3. ... Nd7 or 3. ... Bd7 or 3. ... Nc6. I'd play 3. ... Nd7 4. d4 Ngf6 5. Nc3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 e5 7. Qd3 h6 8. Be3 Be7 but hey you know whatever. ^_^ But it looks good you know. But as white you want more than that you know? You know."

And not only did I manage to get it out of the way but now I have made it possible to launch an attack. Now don't misinterprete I never!!! attack early. But it was a game for fun and I decided to try to attack his weakness.
148,6,5,Qh5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Now this move forces him to do one of two things. Either play g6 and Qxe5 claims the rook or he can move his king forward. Personally I would prefer to keep material where possible and I would move ke7.
149,6,6,Qxe5+,b'rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',Now I am going to force him all over the board. This is similar to another one of my annotations but this one requires more work.

Again giving back material with the tricky 16...Nc5 is an option where white actually can't take 17.dxc5? because of 17...Qxd3 18.cxd3 exf5 and black is up a pawn if a bit tied up at the moment. White should probably continue the attack with something like 17.Qh3 and black seems forced to give the knight back anyway (17...Ne4 18.fxe6 Ke7 19.Bb4 Nd6 20.Qf5 Nf6 21.Nf4 or something piling on the pressure) and play 17...exf5 18.dxc5 Ne7 19.Bc3 and white is much better.

16...e5? isn't any good either 17.Qc4+ Ke8 18.dxe5.

I won't state it categorically but 'tis likely that white missed a winning try with 15.Nxf7! Kxf7 16.f5!. Instead black is able to relieve some pressure."
267,12,12,1dxe5,b'r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/4P2N/5P2/6Q1/PPPB2P1/2KR3R b kq -',I thought the d-file was more important than the f-file (16.fxe5) mainly as to prevent black from castling queenside.
268,12,13,1Bc3,b'r2qkbnr/pp3p2/2p1p1pp/4P2N/5P2/2B3Q1/PPP3P1/2KR3R b kq -',An in-between move to secure the d-file (refer to my comment under 16.dxe5). 17.Bb4 Qc7 18.Bxf8 Kxf8 19.Nf6 Nxf6 20.exf6 was also possible and it may even have been better avoiding all the trouble black's 19th move in the game gave me.
269,12,14,1Nf6+,b'r3kbnr/ppq2p2/2p1pNpp/4P3/5P2/2B3Q1/PPP3P1/2KR3R b kq -',No turning back.
270,12,15,Bd6,b'r3k2r/ppq2p2/2pbpPpp/8/5P2/2B3Q1/PPP3P1/2KR3R w kq -',Black is only one move away from consolidating with O-O-O. I felt I had to do something and rejected the obvious 20.Be5.
271,12,16,2Rxd6,b'r3k2r/ppq2p2/2pRpPpp/8/5P2/2B3Q1/PPP3P1/2K4R b kq -',Burning the bridges! An exchange sacrifice more out of frustration than anything (I didn't see 23.f5 at first which I should have) seeing how black had slowly neutralized my initiative with exchanges and careful defense. 20.Be5 was the more logical alternative but which allows 20...Bxe5 (20...O-O-O? 21.Rxd6! and 22.f5) 21.fxe5 and only the heavy pieces remain. White might still have a symbolic advantage but black should probably draw with careful play.
272,12,17,2f5,b'r3k2r/pp3p2/2p1pPpp/q3BP2/8/6Q1/PPP3P1/2KR4 b kq -',Only here I realized the strength of 23.f5!. Black is suddenly in trouble and it isn't easy to find the correct reply.
273,12,18,2exf5,b'r3k2r/pp3p2/2p2Ppp/q3Bp2/8/6Q1/PPP3P1/2KR4 w kq -',"No! This is probably the decisive mistake which seems to lose by force. The only move seems to be 23...Rd8! and after 24.Rxd8+ Kxd8 25.b4 (inviting Qxb4 to stop the attack on the bishop) Qd5! and black should hold.

I had also calculated 23...gxf5 24.Qg7 Rf8 25.Bd6 O-O-O 26.Bxf8 winning a piece but after 26...Rxd1+ 27.Kxd1 Qd5+ 28.Kc1 Qd4! black has some chances at a perpetual. Even this was preferable to the move played."
274,12,19,2Qe3,b'r3k2r/pp3p2/2p2Ppp/q3Bp2/8/4Q3/PPP3P1/2KR4 b kq -',The key move now black is in big trouble.
275,12,20,2Rd7,b'r4k1r/pp1R1p2/2p2Ppp/q3Bp2/8/4Q3/PPP3P1/2K5 b - -',Precision is of utmost importance the careless 25.Bd6+? ruins everything since after 25...Kg8 black escapes. 25.Rd7 also threatens Bd6+ and Qe7 say 25...Rd8 26.Bd6+ Kg8 27.Qe7.
276,12,21,2Kg8,b'r5kr/pp1R1p2/2p2Ppp/q3Bp2/8/4Q3/PPP3P1/2K5 w - -',25...Qxa2 26.Qc5+ and 27.Qe7.

279,12,24,2Qe7,b'r5kr/pp1RQp2/2p2Ppp/5p2/8/2B5/qPP3P1/2K5 b - -',Now white threatens 28.b3 obstructing the a2-g8 diagonal.
280,12,25,2Qc4,b'r5kr/pp1RQp2/2p2Ppp/5p2/2q5/2B5/1PP3P1/2K5 w - -',27...Rf8? 28.Qxf8! but even this is hopeless.
281,12,26,2b3,b'r5kr/pp1RQp2/2p2Ppp/5p2/2q5/1PB5/2P3P1/2K5 b - -',"Black's queen has nowhere to go. 28...Qe6 29.Qxe6 fxe6 30.f7+ or 28...Qd5 29.Rxd5 and it's curtains. Black resigns.

It was an interesting battle full of possibilities for both sides which I didn't see during the game. A very satisfying win in the end especially because of the circumstances (see under 1.e4) and because my opponent is a really good player.

And for those reading hopefully it was an interesting game to go through. All criticism is as always welcome and thank you for stopping by!

P.S.: I may do a little revision in the next few days if I have the time."

That's 4 moves for 1 piece in the 1st 18 moves of the game. That is 22% of his moves are made by 1 piece! In so doing he is slowing up his own development.

Bxc3 - hmmph - I am now a piece ahead but Gameknot Analysis does not like Bxc3 please refer to the link for further detail.  I guess while white has a dsb and the queens are on the board there is a possibility of Henry being checkmated by Qg7# so I must be a little careful here.

I am aware that Old Matey is not too far away from Henry.  I must be really careful especially if Steve's dsb can get onto the h8-a1 diagonal and Steve's rook can give a check on my first rank.

447,19,14,4b3,b'8/3b4/1p3k1p/1p1B4/2nP1p2/PPP2N2/7K/8 b - -',Apparently White agrees with me to the tune of preferring to give up a pawn.
448,19,15,Kxe6,b'8/8/1p2k2p/1p2N3/3P1p2/nPP5/7K/8 w - -',Again I think the ending favours me with wide-spread pawns and a much better placed King.

450,19,17,5Kf3,b'8/8/1p2k2p/1P2N3/3P1p2/1n3K2/8/8 b - -',Here I could win both White's pawns but after 55. ... Nxd4+; 56. Kxf4 Nxb5; 57. Nc4 and there is nothing to be done to save the pawn on b6. Knights are notoriously bad at stopping passed Rook's pawns but I don't have enough theory to know if K + N + hP beats K + N and I suspected it probably didn't.
451,19,18,Nd6,b'8/8/1pNn3p/1P3k2/3P1p2/5K2/8/8 w - -',Now White can only hold onto his b-pawn at the price of condemning his Knight to a miserable square.
452,19,19,6d5,b'8/4N3/1p1n3p/1P1P2k1/5p2/5K2/8/8 b - -',So he lets the b-pawn go and hopes to create some chances based on his passed d-pawn.
453,19,20,6Ke4,b'2N5/8/1p5p/3P2k1/3nKp2/8/8/8 b - -',Here I think White's King should have gone to f2 and as far as I can tell the win is extremely difficult if it exists at all.
454,19,21,6Ke3,b'2N5/8/1p5p/3P2k1/3n4/4Kp2/8/8 b - -',White saw that he couldn't take the Knight - and I that I needed to keep my f-pawn.
455,19,22,Kg3,b'2N5/8/1p1P3p/8/3n4/4Kpk1/8/8 w - -',Threatening to push the f-pawn again but it's a balancing act: soon my Knight will be completely tied to defence.
456,19,23,6Ne4,b'8/3P4/1p2n2p/8/4N3/4Kp2/6k1/8 b - -',White resigned here without waiting for my reply. I still have to tread carefully as after 67. ... h5; 68. Ng5 f2; 69. Nxe6 f1(Q); 70. d8(Q) Qe1+; 71. any Qxe6; I'm in a difficult Queen ending with my King far from my pawns. True I have an outright win if I can exchange Queens soon as the White King can't possibly stop both my remaining pawns but I don't get much practice at Queen endings! However after 67. ... Nd8 I think I'm pretty much bulletproof - it's only a matter of time before the Knight has to go to f2 (or f1 depending) to hold the f- and h-pawns and then White's got nothing left to stop the b-pawn. A hard fight!

So Zach this 1st move of yours is not particularly bad the only drawback is that it's pretty passive. The best moves in my opinion are those that force your opponents hand. On the other hand if you choose to be a passive player it's not necessarily a bad thing. I will quote move one from my tutoring game with Ajay ""... I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive!"". I might add that I was a stronger player then than I am now. Pablo and I had some fierce games but I never beat him even once! Keep in mind though that in taking advice from me you are hearing from an aggressive player.

In the opening it is always important to control the center squares e4 e5 d4 & d5. One way to do that is to occupy those squares with your pawns & pieces (playing e4 and / or d4 for example). The other way is what you have chosen to control them without occupying them (e3 controls d4). This plan you have chosen is not bad but is usually played by black."

There are plenty of chess books on opening play in any good library or book store. Book stores are better though since chess openings are frequently revised as people play. So you want the most modern you can get. Library books can be pretty old. I suggest Batsford Chess Openings by Kasparov."

462,20,5,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/2pp4/2BP4/1PN1PN2/P1P2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ d6',"Zach let me make up an imaginary scene then relate it to chess.

Imagine twins Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack sets aside $10000 in the year 2010 and invests it at a certain interest rate say for example 9%. In the year 2050 his total interest earned would be $304094.20. After inflation (supposing a 2% inflation rate) it would be $137721.30 giving him a total value for his investment of $142250.20.

Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040 and sets aside $10000 and invests it at the same interest rate 9%. In the year 2050 his total interest earned would be only $13673.60. After inflation (supposing the same 2% inflation rate) it would be $11217.10 giving him a total value for his investment of $19420.60. What is interesting about this scenario is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack!

You may ask ""Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!""

One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square to a more active location). One way to do this is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop a piece then I develop a pawn to attack your piece forcing you to move it a 2nd time I gain a ""tempo"" and you lose a tempo.

One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely castle right now for example. You'd lose your bishop! Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move he hinders you from doing what you may have planned (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan). It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative similar to Jake and Jack you're far less likely to be able to catch up! If he forces you to make a move you did not want to make it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! Be careful not to allow your opponent to gain tempo faster than you do.

On every move consider what check threats there are. If there is a check is it a double attack forking the king and another piece? These type of thoughts need to be on every move.

Take your time look at everything. I mean Every Thing! The rook on a2 was blocked by your bishop which may be why you did not see the indirect attack on your king. But whenever a rook is on the 2nd rank and your king is on the back rank there is this threat. The 2nd rank is the strongest place for a rook when the king is on the 1st rank.

This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes between myself Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend Ajay (grey_sparrow).

So Ajay I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess my favorite game. First I want to say there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men ""OK there are 10000 of us. I want 9000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9000 at the top attack them. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say ""When you engage in hand to hand combat use the long swords as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though."" That is a tactic not a strategy. Strategies give general direction tactics are more specific.

So in our game for example my strategy in the middle game was to force you to trade off your DSB then infiltrate the dark squares near your king and form a mating net around him. That's strategy my basic game plan. Tactics are putting my bishop on g5 to chase your queen away my knight on f6 to check your king and when you trade my knight off taking back with the pawn to attack your g7 square ect. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. 

A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say ""Ajay this guys is leading you wrong."" It's not that I'm leading you wrong but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive!

So when taking advise (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible then make a rational decision for yourself based on your own style and abilities what is for you."

It is an unique opening in that it can be played almost regardless of black's moves.

You are playing something like the Kings Indian Defense (KID). I say ""something like"" because the knight usually goes on d7 not c6 in this defense and a pawn needs to be pushed to e5 or c5. But the knight move I think is O.K. I personally see no real problems with the knight on c6. In the KID though you need to push the pawn to e5 or c5 (in this case e5 because the knight blocks c5). Otherwise you may find yourself somewhat restricted. There is more than sufficient support for e5 while the pawn on e6 blocks in your Queen side bishop. Another reason you should play e5 is that I am playing the Colle system. My pawn center needs to be confronted. You later moved your knight so that you can move the c-pawn but I will speak on that later."

There are principles in chess just as in life which if you violate you risk serious consequences. Examples of these principles are: 1. develop your pieces as quickly as possible. 2. Avoid double pawns. 3. Don't keep your king in the center. Castle instead. 4. And many more!!!

Two such principles are: 1. Develop toward the center and 2. Avoid moving the same piece over and over again in the opening. In the initial moves of the game focus primarily on the 4 central squares d4 d5 e4 and e5 and secondarily on the squares immediately surrounding those squares. Each piece and central pawn should either occupy or control one or more of these squares. One of the reasons for this is that when you move a knight to a5 for example it will take the knight longer to get some where else you need him to be. He would have been beneficial to you in defending your king in this game. If he were on c3 where you had him it would take less moves to get him to the kingside. A knight on c6 controls 7 dark squares in the area. A knight on a5 only controls 4.

You obviously moved the knight so you could play c5 and you probably planned on putting the knight back afterwards. So if you put it back on your 12th move that would make 3 knight moves in the 1st 12 moves of the game. That means 25% of your moves have been made by one piece (3 out of 12). That's not a good deal when you are needing to get all of the pieces in to play quickly!

If you really needed your pawn on c5 and your knight on c6 you'd have saved time by playing c4 then Nc3 which takes only 2 moves. Moving your knight to c6 then to a4 then pawn to c4 then Knight back to c6 take 4 moves. It may seem unimportant but one of the most important principles in the opening is quick development of all pieces. Among strong players there is a constant battle to gain even a small lead in development.

There's a term in chess called ""tempo"". That is the term to describe how far behind or ahead you are in development. A tempo is measured by 1 move. The following paragraphs I copy and pasted from wikipedia.org.

""Gaining tempo may be achieved for example by developing a piece while delivering check though here too if the check can be countered by the development of a piece the net result may be nil. If the check can be blocked by a useful pawn move which also drives the checking piece away the check may even lose a tempo.

In general making moves with gain of tempo is desirable. A player is said to have the initiative if they are able to keep making moves which force their opponent to respond in a particular way or limit their responses. The player with the initiative has greater choice of moves and can to some extent control the direction the game takes though this advantage is only relative and may not be worth very much (having a slight initiative when a rook down for example may be worthless)...."""

If it is chased away where can it go? When it goes to that 2nd spot can it be chased? If so where can it go?"" and so on... So this knight in moving to g4 started a frantic escape attempt which ended with him throwing himself on the sword. He was sitting on h6 being attacked and no where to go. The better option instead of 12. ... Ng4 would have been Nd7 where he attacks the e5 pawn. You could then quietly develop an attack on that pawn by Qc7 and Nc6."

So at a glance you can see this knight only has 4 white squares he connects to. Each of these squares is either attacked by me or occupied by you. So you should have seen before moving to this square that it makes your knight an easy prey. If I chose to I could have won the knight by playing Qc1 then BxN. This would contradict my plan though because you can trade off bishops and I need my DSB for the infiltration of your dark squares. The plan I chose wins the knight gets rid of your bishop and keeps my bishop on the board.

So you've moved one knight 3 times and the other 6 times. This hinders your ability to develop your pieces."

Let me relate it to a real life situation (as I frequently do. You'll notice that's how I teach). There are governmental laws made for our benefit some of which can save our lives if we abide by them; not driving through a red light for example. Yet imagine if you have an injured loved one in critical condition. There is no ambulance in your town so you have to drive them a half hour to the hospital. You come to a red light at an intersection where there are no buildings around only open fields. So you can see far in all directions and you know there are no cars coming. Will you stop at the light? Some people would speed through some may slow down. I don't think anyone in their right mind would come to a complete stop and look both ways before continuing the way the law says to do. When a person is on the border line between life and death every second counts. So the consequences of stopping can be far more grievous than driving through. When considering a move that violates the laws of sound chess evaluate whether the benefits of such a move outweigh the drawbacks. If they do go for it. Over time you will learn when it's O.K. to violate a principle. In the case of my knight on h4 I knew when I put it on f5 (sacrifice) the knight would threaten Nh6 mate (after I get my bishop on g7). So you would have to take thus opening more lines of attack for me. Therefore it is worth violating the principle.

If one plan does not work out so long as your making good moves another one will materialize. As nuntar said in his comment on my annotation (Move 17) ""Ah but it's good to be flexible and notice occasions when a plan can profitably be abandoned for a better one!"""

678,31,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here is a game where development helped me take over the board. In order to keep things clear I am playing as white. I will soon enter it into the KOH game of the month contest. Let me know what you think.
679,31,1,a5,b'rnbqkbnr/1pppp1p1/5p2/p6p/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq a6',He has given me time to take control of the middle of the board. Although it is not recommended to move 3 pawns in a row because it wastes tempo these move helped me dominate the middle of the board.
680,31,2,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/1pppn1p1/2n2p2/p3p2p/2PPP3/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',At this point all of my minor pieces are developed and I seem to be in total control of e4 e5 d4 d5. I've also got many options with the bishops as well as my knights.
681,31,3,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pppn1p1/2n2p2/p6p/2PpP3/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',He takes and I take back with the bishop.
682,31,4,h3,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1n1p1/2np1p2/p6p/2PBP3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now that I have control of the board I can begin to make small movements to better my position. My King is in no danger whatsoever so why rush to castle?
683,31,5,Rh6,b'r1bqkb2/1pp1n1p1/2np1p1r/p6p/2PBP3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R w KQq -',This move seems amateurish and the prevention of castling is key in the middle game.....especially since he has lost his kingside castling.
684,31,6,1O-O,b'r1bqkb2/1pp1n1p1/2np1p1r/p6p/2PBP3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b q -',Castling to protect the King.

686,31,8,1Nxe5,b'r1bqkb2/1pp1n3/3p1p1r/p3N1pp/2P1P3/2NBB2P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b q -',Why not take? I've got control of the board and plenty of attacking possibilities.
687,31,9,1Re1,b'r1b1kb2/1ppqn3/5p1r/p3p1pp/P1P1P3/2NBB2P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 b q -',Once again trivial moves to try to improve my position before attacking. All these trivial moves pay off at the end.
688,31,10,1Ra6,b'2b1kb2/1ppqn3/r4p1r/p3p1pp/P1P1P3/2NBB2P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Once again he has now prevented castling. He cannot castle either way and he must play the remainder of the game with his king unprotected. This becomes death for him later...
689,31,11,Rd6,b'2b1kb2/1ppqn3/3r1p1r/p3p1pp/P1P1P3/1PNBB2P/5PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Here there is more pressure on the bishop at d3. So to prevent the loss of the bishop and of control of the game I block with the knight.
690,31,12,f5,b'2b1kb2/1ppq4/3r3r/p2Ppppp/P1P5/1P1BB2P/5PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',This move opens up channels for attack. I see many moves which can put me up in material. Right now the material is split but not for long....

692,31,14,1Rhg6,b'2b1kb2/1ppq4/3r2r1/p2PppBp/P1P5/1P1B3P/5PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Here he does as expected...

694,31,16,1Kf7,b'2b2b2/1ppq1k2/3r2r1/p2PRpBp/P1P5/1P1B3P/5PP1/R2Q2K1 w - -',Now he had several options here other than that. He could have played Re6 but my d5 pawn which I established in the 2nd move now prevents him from doing that without losing the rook. He could also move his Queen to protect (Qe7 but my bishop and my rook both attack that square.) Finally his best move would have been be7 other than the move he took. He would have exchanged bishop for bishop rook for Queen. Not ideal but...............Also I have bxf5 available splitting the Queen and rook. That would have screwed everything up anyways.
695,31,17,2Bxf5,b'2b2b2/1ppq1k2/3r2r1/p2PRBBp/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R2Q2K1 b - -',Here it goes his whole defense is split and he is forced to decide between the rook and the Queen. His Queen is currently trapped all avenues of escape covered. His only option to save the Queen is to block with the rook. (Rge6)
696,31,18,2Qxh5+,b'2b2b2/1ppq1k2/3rr3/p2PRBBQ/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',"Now moving the rook has opened up another hole in his defense. It occured to me that I could have done this earlier before playing bxf5 but I wanted to make sure to keep him on the run and not give him a free move. Pinning the rook and having his Queen trapped would have been great but I needed to keep my advantage. My queen both bishops and a rook are now bearing down on the unprotected King. His options with the King are g7 g8. g8 is not favorable because bxe6 then splits it and the Queen while capturing a free rook. My choice here would be kg7.


Now he could also move Rg6 but that would mean abandoning his Queen and it's a little early for heroics."
697,31,19,2Bxe6+,b'2b2bk1/1ppq4/3rB3/p2PR1BQ/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',As I said Kg8 opened up another stream of attacks for me.
698,31,20,2Rxe6,b'2b2bk1/1ppq4/4R3/p2P2BQ/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',Now I take in order to bear down on the 6th rank. Now I can eventually move it to the 7th rank pin the king and deliver checkmate with the Queen.
699,31,21,2Qh7,b'2b2bk1/1pp4q/4R3/p2P2BQ/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',Here he proposes to exchange the Queens. I am up 11 points in material so the one thing I should be trying to do is simplify. But there is yet one more avenue of attack.
700,31,22,2Rg6+,b'2b2bk1/1pp4q/6R1/p2P2BQ/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',"Here he has 3 options. Kh8 Qg7 or bg7. 

Kh8 allows me to play bf6+ which pins the King. He then is forced to play bg7. When I take that bishop his king moves g8 and when I back up with bishop his King has nowhere to go and it's a checkmate. No win on that move for him. He must try the other two...

Qg7 is just plain wrong because you sacrifice the Queen for nothing. That leaves bg7 It is the only move that does not sacrifice a piece. He ends up picking this option."
701,31,23,2Bh6,b'2b3k1/1pp3bq/6RB/p2P3Q/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',Now I block the exchange and put pressure on the pinned bishop. It's most likely the bishop bishop Queen rook exchange from earlier.
702,31,24,2Qxg6,b'2b3k1/1pp3b1/6qB/p2P3Q/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',He gets fed up and exchanges Queen for Rook. The game is pretty much lost at this point.
703,31,25,2Qxg6,b'2b3k1/1pp3b1/6QB/p2P4/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',At this point I am 15 points ahead in material value...game over....
704,31,26,2Kf8,b'2b2k2/1pp3b1/6QB/p2P4/P1P5/1P5P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',Obviously I plan to take the bishop.
