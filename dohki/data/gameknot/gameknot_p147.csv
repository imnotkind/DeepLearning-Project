0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A normal opening
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',my stock response. I have tried out the sicilian (1. ...c4) but didn't like the choices my opponent could have as to how open or closed the game was and the French (1. ... e6) but quickly found I had a huge space disadvantge and so retured to this.
2,0,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Ruy Lopez whites most common opening.
3,0,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A little seen response but a good one. I beleive this is called the Cordel variation but I'm not sure. It threatens to fork the knight on e5 (after 4. BxN dxB 5. Nxe5 Qd4) and a mate on f7 which will result in black winning back the pawn and having a superior position.
4,0,4,Bxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2B5/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',My opponent duly obliges and takes the knight.
5,0,5,dxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2p5/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I continue as planned. In a normal Ruy Lopez position black would take with the b pawn to gain more control in the centre. 
6,0,6,g3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2p5/2b1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I'm not sure what this move was for. My opponent doesn't have an LSB to fianchetto and this just creates weaknesse on g4 h3 and the knight on f3. The only reason I could think of was to move the knight push f4 and then castle queenside. However I would continue development before trying anything like this.
7,0,7,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I continue my development with an attack on the undefended pawn on e4.
8,0,8,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1N3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',My opponent now takes the 'free' pawn on e5. I could take on e4 with my knight threatening f2 but I prefer...
9,0,9,Qd4,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1N3/3qP3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Qd4! I threaten mate on f2 the knight on e5 and the pawn on e4.

11,0,11,Qe2,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/4q3/3N2P1/PPPPQP1P/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Pins my queen so I can't take the rook on h1.
12,0,12,Kxe2,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/8/3N2P1/PPPPKP1P/RNB4R b kq -',Queens swapped black definitely has the better position as white cannot castle and is down on development.
13,0,13,Bb6,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/1bp2n2/8/8/3N2P1/PPPPKP1P/RNB4R w kq -',I retreat the bishop out of harms way but I should have gone to d6. b6 loses a piece eventually as the bichop can't retreat any further.
14,0,14,1b3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/1bp2n2/8/8/1P1N2P1/P1PPKP1P/RNB4R b kq -',My opponent plans to fianchetto his DSB rather than moving the knight and then the pawn on the d-file. This also sets him up for a Q-side attack.
15,0,15,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1bp2n2/8/8/1P1N2P1/P1PPKP1P/RNB4R w - -',I castle to get my king out of the way and to get the rook involved down the e-file. Perhaps I should have played a6 or a5 to give my Bishop an escape square.
16,0,16,Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1bp5/3n4/8/1P1N2P1/PBPPKP1P/RN5R w - -',?? Not sure why I did this it just loses a piece.
17,0,17,1c4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1bp5/3n4/2P5/1P1N2P1/PB1PKP1P/RN5R b - c3',! The knight is attacked and when it moves c5 and then b4 are fatal for my bishop.

204,6,7,1Nh4,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbpn1p/7P/3P3N/3Q2N1/PPPB1PP1/R4RK1 b kq -',I did not want that to happen so I moved my f3 knight away using my queen to protect my g3 knight. This ensures that my pawn structure stays okay but the downside of this move is that one of my knight has moved to the rim of the board which is bad.
205,6,8,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbpn1p/7P/3P3N/3Q2N1/PPPB1PP1/R4RK1 w kq -',Black creates a battery along the b8-h2 diagonal.

Looking at this position you can pretty know why I had a bloodshed. My knight is sleeping at the rim the 1st and 2nd ranks are weak and my opponent has the ability to attack there my pawns at the queenside are weak and my king does not have a safe square to escape.
212,6,15,Ree2,b'2k5/pp3pp1/2p2n1p/5P1P/5RnN/8/PPPrr1P1/2R3K1 w - -',My opponent comes in and grabs my c2 pawn.

221,6,24,3Ke3,b'1k6/pp6/2p1n2p/1r4p1/R2n4/3NK3/P5P1/8 b - -',My final decision was to use my king to attack my opponent's pieces and hope that my opponent makes a blunder
222,6,25,4Ke4,b'1k6/pp6/2p1n2p/3r1np1/RN2K3/8/P5P1/8 b - -',My final horrible and terrible blunder. So it turns out htat it wasn't my opponent who blundered in the endgame but me!
223,6,26,4Nc5+,b'1k6/pp6/2p4p/2nr1np1/RN2K3/8/P5P1/8 w - -',And the final assasination of my pieces. My opponent made a king-rook fork which leads me to a position where I am dead lost. I resigned at this position seeing that I had no way to save myself after making a blunder. This game is a memorable game for me as it really made me think how did I go wrong. Hope you chess fans would like this annontated game where I lost horribly.

306,11,21,1exd4,b'rnb2b1q/pppk3p/3p4/3B3Q/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',he's going to survive for awhile on that diagonal
307,11,22,1cxd4,b'rnb2b1q/pppk3p/3p4/3B3Q/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',i probably took that pawn one move too soon.  this would have been a good time to castle... I know many of you would say I should have done that a long time ago.  
308,11,23,1Qxd4,b'rnb2b2/pppk3p/3p4/3B3Q/3qP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',so he wants my rook but can i keep him in check for awhile?

310,11,25,1Be7,b'rnb5/pppkbQ1p/3p4/3B4/3qP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',i figured...but my plan allows for this

314,11,29,1Kd7,b'rnb3Q1/pppkb2p/3p4/3B4/3qP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',all those checks did was move my queen into position...

316,11,31,1Qxb2,b'rnb3Q1/pppkb2p/3p4/3B4/4P3/8/Pq3PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',just as i thought but this will benefit me more than him...

319,11,34,1Be6+,b'rnb3Q1/pppkb2p/3pB3/8/4P3/2q5/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',looks like I still have some work to do.
320,11,35,1Kc6,b'rnb3Q1/ppp1b2p/2kpB3/8/4P3/2q5/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',no problem.  now theyre lined up
321,11,36,1Rfc1,b'rnb3Q1/ppp1b2p/2kpB3/8/4P3/2q5/P4PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',pin.  I chose the king side rook because with Qe8 the kings only escape is the b file and queens rook is still available to strike from there.
322,11,37,1Qxc1+,b'rnb3Q1/ppp1b2p/2kpB3/8/4P3/8/P4PPP/R1q3K1 w - -',sacrifice.  i have to admit i would have felt pretty hopeless if i was black at this point.
323,11,38,2Rxc1+,b'rnb3Q1/ppp1b2p/2kpB3/8/4P3/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',my only move

325,11,40,2Qxc8,b'rnQ5/ppp1b2p/1k1pB3/8/4P3/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',finally ended the bishops game.  I imagine him staring in the face of my queen all the time watching this happen to his king.  Sad.
326,11,41,2c5,b'rnQ5/pp2b2p/1k1pB3/2p5/4P3/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 w - c6',probably would have taken that pawn next if not for this move.  So how do I end this?  im sure ive already missed a forced mate right?  
327,11,42,2Rb1+,b'rnQ5/pp2b2p/1k1pB3/2p5/4P3/8/P4PPP/1R4K1 b - -',another check this will trap him on the a file
328,11,43,2Ka6,b'rnQ5/pp2b2p/k2pB3/2p5/4P3/8/P4PPP/1R4K1 w - -',could have extended his life a little longer with Ka5 but its inevitable now

332,12,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',A common King's pawn opening.
333,12,1,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here black enters a gambit I have never faced before which is quite bad if white declines. If white takes the knight black wins only 26% of the time.
334,12,2,Nxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I took the pawn hastily only glancing at possible threats.
335,12,3,Qg5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N1q1/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I saw this move before but didn't realize that the g-pawn would be under attack. I now thought for much longer than usual but alas black has forced win of material or mate.
336,12,4,Ng4,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/6q1/2BnP1N1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the best I could come up with. Taking on f7 is disastrous after 5. ... Qxg2 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ 7. Be2 Nf3#. Immediate mate could be avoided but only by sacrificing a lot of material. Another option was Bxf7+ but then my bishop and knight are in danger.
337,12,5,d5,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p2q1/2BnP1N1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',This was the expected response white must still give up the piece.
338,12,6,Be2,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p2q1/3nP1N1/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I decided not to take the pawn but instead to try and relieve pressure.

341,12,9,Qg6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2pp1/6q1/3p3p/3nP1N1/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Probably the best response. This keeps pressure on g2 and threatens to win a pawn on e4 but then looking at my response makes me think this move was not so great.
342,12,10,Ne5,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2pp1/6q1/3pN2p/3nP3/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Again I am trying to relieve the pressure on my position. Notice that I have the bishop on e2 ready for defense which I did not have on move 4. I am eyeing 8. ... Qxg2 9. Bf3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 dxe4 12. dxe4 Bg4 13. Ne5 etc. which is exactly what happened.
343,12,11,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/ppp2pp1/8/4N2p/4P1b1/8/PPP2P1P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',My opponent has the better position here but I have relieved a great amount of pressure which is what I wanted. Notice that my opponent is threatening Rd1#.

345,12,13,1hxg4,b'2kr1bnr/ppp2pp1/8/8/4P1p1/8/PPP2P1P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Now I try to develope my pieces and make some threats of my own.

350,12,18,1b3,b'2kr3r/pp3pp1/2p2n2/6B1/4P1p1/1Pb5/P1P2P1P/2KR3R b - -',Now all in a fraction of a second I pick up my pawn and move it to take the bishop but wait I accidentally moved to the wrong square. It's good thing that it's correspondance chess because I can just fix it but look at that! I've already hit submit! What followed was some desperate attempt to close the window or otherwise stop the submission but I think you can guess how that turned out.
351,12,19,1Rxd1+,b'2k4r/pp3pp1/2p2n2/6B1/4P1p1/1Pb5/P1P2P1P/2Kr3R w - -',"Now I resign in utter disgust perhaps it wasn't technically the worst move I've ever made but it was definitely the most damaging to my ego. I guess the lesson here is that you should always check twice because taking those few extra seconds won't kill you but not doing so could.

P.S. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else can truthfully say that they have done this before or that they have seen someone do it. It might just make me feel better. :(

At the moment the the queen gets way in the smooth development of the DSB (Dark Squared Bishop) after e6 and so Black may need to play g6 and Bg7 to develop the bishop. The Queen can't do to d7 because it blocks Nd7

Also black gives up his most useful piece. He wasted a tempo playing Bg4 and also his queen at the moment is more of a nuance than a help because it blocks the development of his DSB.

Black has the half-open d file an entire series of pawn holes (weak-square complex) a compromised king side and his king is now held in the middle (-2 P.C.) putting White around 5 points ahead (despite what the computer analysis says).

The knight on c6 isn't accomplishing anything on the queenside and Bareev intelligently moves that knight to e7 connecting both knights and defending the kingside.

This reminds me of the Battle of Arcole where the French and Austrian armies are stuck in a stalemate (although Napoleon managed to cross the bridge and break through the Austrian position).

White has no quick way of realizing his advantage. At the board I thought at first that it would be best to exchange a pair of Rooks and the prepare for the advance P-K5 supported by minor pieces. Another plan recommented by Tigran Petrosian is worth considering: B-B3 B-Q1 B-B2 N-KB1 N-K3 followed by either P-K5 or P-B5.

But in the heat of the last round I opted for an energetic (and premature!) advance in the center and on the K side.

[one thing: my respected opponent offered a draw few moves back but i declined and now i offered. So may be my opponent say that i was stupid didn't accept draw earlier. Well it was not for no reason. Few moves back my opponent lost (other) few games so his rating decreased if i would accept then i would lost few points. But after couple of hours he won some games and his rating leveled. So it became logical to draw now. Sorry for keeping you in wait few hours :)]"

By pinning the Knight Black gains several advantages. He neutralizes the Knight's pressure on the center. In some instances Black will exchange BxN which weakens White's queenside pawns. Black also gains a temporarily lead in developmant with two pieces out. Finally Black can now castle in one move while White has yet to develop any of his Kingside forces. It is easy to see why the Nimzo is favored by many of the world's best players.

The text forces a permanent weakness on white's queenside pawns. Also White no longer has the option developing his Knight on e2 as in the normal Samisch line. Black saddles White with doubled pawns. However amid the large scale of activities of the middlegame Black will have difficulty concentrating on this weakness as the diversion of force this would entail might leave his K-side in the lurch. Hence Black plays to prevent or nutralize any aggressive overtures from White knowing that an eventual endgame will allow him to exploit the doubled pawns without the fear of a K-side attack. This is also good psychology as it lets White know he must come up with resourceful middle game play or eventually face an inferior endgame.

White plays to open up the center. The trouble is that Black skillfully keeps the center well barricaded with pawns restricting the scope of the Bishops.

The right way is to sit on the position by 10.Nd2 followed by f3 Nf1-e3 etc.Black has no counterplay unless White tries violent measures. In view of the obstructing barrier of pawns in the center the White Bishops have reduced mobility. To rectify this Spassky aims for f4 to try to open up lines as quickly as possible.
