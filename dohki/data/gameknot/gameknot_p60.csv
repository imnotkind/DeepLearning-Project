0,0,0,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',The Budapest. It seems a bad move (and for high standards it is) but...
1,0,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',...White faced me with this for the first time! Very good! I confess I didn't know what to play. White can press me with dxe and my N is pinned so...
2,0,2,Qxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/6B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',This is looking very bad for black. I don't study chess so I don't know any theory behind this. So thank you justparanoid for your lesson!
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',I didn't like this move since I don't want to block the c pawn and in fact I thought strongly about c5 at once. But Qe5+ was very annoying so I opted for this knowing that I will be struggle against the white knight's jumps on the 5th rank. 
4,0,4,Qe7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/6B1/8/2N1Q3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Well I have to get out of this and swapping queens will help me to develop the bishop f7 to e7 defending the knight. BUT white can of course play BxN and now I have to QxQ fxQ will leave him with weak doubled pawns. But white has Nd5... Provoking QxQ but retaking with the kinght then o-o-o...
5,0,5,O-O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/6B1/8/2N1Q3/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR b kq -',Not bad but provides me with an objective I can't expoit at the moment. I have to catch up in developement and he just left me the chance to to that. I should have provoked it with h6 but Bf4 opens a new treat on c7 and besides Nd5 is still a possibility for white. 
6,0,6,Ng4,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/6n1/2N1B3/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w kq -',...and now this is nastier than it seems. It threats to double white's central pawns (they are weak because black has the two bishops and the semi open column in front of them. 
7,0,7,Bf4,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/5Bn1/2N5/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR b kq -',White surprisingly has no good place for the bishop defending f2! But maybe he overlooked the threatened fork...
8,0,8,Nxf2,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/5B2/2N5/PPP1PnPP/2KR1BNR w kq -',...which is more than a fork: white can't save the h1 rook. 
9,0,9,Rd4,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3R1B2/2N5/PPP1PnPP/2K2BNR b kq -',On the contrary he thinks in activating its other rook. A good idea but overlooks...
10,0,10,Nxd4,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/8/3n1B2/2N5/PPP1PnPP/2K2BNR w kq -',...and now the game is lost for white. Still there are many pieces on the board and I was playing really lightly so I made some serious mistakes. 
11,0,11,1e3,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/8/3n1B2/2N1P3/PPP2nPP/2K2BNR b kq -',White could have taken the c7 pawn. Black can move some pawns trying to block it and white will lose some developement advantage but still it left the d pawn isolated and that is good for white.
12,0,12,1Bc4,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4n3/8/2B2B2/2N1P3/PPP2nPP/2K3NR b kq -',I should have exchanged at once the bishop. White is threatening again the exchange and Bxc7 but it is doubtful it will compensate for the loss of the bishop pair. 
13,0,13,1Nxh1,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4n3/8/2B2B2/2N1P3/PPP3PP/2K3Nn w kq -',Let's see what white does. 
14,0,14,1Nf3,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4n3/8/2B2B2/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n b kq -',Ok so if he doesn't I'll go for...
15,0,15,1Bc5,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/4n3/2b5/2B2B2/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n w kq -',This presses a little e6. My pieces out as quick as possible! It's incredible but even if I am +11 I have to think on this game a little more. 
16,0,16,1Nd5,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/4n3/2bN4/2B2B2/4PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n b kq -',I could have defended but hey I wanted to see if the guy had got the idea. 
17,0,17,1Nxc7+,b'r1b1k2r/ppNp1ppp/8/2b5/2B2n2/4PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n b kq -',Yes he got it! :-)
18,0,18,1Kd8,b'r1bk3r/ppNp1ppp/8/2b5/2B2n2/4PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n w - -',White is forced to take a knignt or a rook and must lose the knight. It seems that taking the rook is better but... 
19,0,19,1Nxa8,b'N1bk3r/pp1p1ppp/8/2b5/2B2n2/4PN2/PPP3PP/2K4n b - -',it leaves white's knight out of the board. 
20,0,20,1Bxe3+,b'N1bk3r/pp1p1ppp/8/8/2B2n2/4bN2/PPP3PP/2K4n w - -',Now it starts a dangerous dance with my now free minor pieces. 
21,0,21,1Ke1,b'N1bk3r/pp1p1ppp/8/8/2B2n2/4bN2/PPP2nPP/4K3 b - -',That's all fine but I have my pieces tied and threatened by the white's king even if they are untouchables by his minor pieces as well. So what to do against g3?
22,0,22,1Re8,b'N1bkr3/pp1p1ppp/8/8/2B2n2/4bN2/PPP2nPP/4K3 w - -',Let's add a discovered check and more power into the equation. 
23,0,23,1Bxf7,b'N1bkr3/pp1p1Bpp/8/8/5n2/4bN2/PPP2nPP/4K3 b - -',Ok now I can simply save the rook but I wanted something more spectacular. 
24,0,24,d6,b'N1bkr3/pp3Bpp/3p4/8/8/4bN2/PPP2nnP/5K2 w - -',White has to choose among the rook or the knight. But if he takes the rook Bh3 should be definitory. Just a bet!
25,0,25,2Kxg2,b'N1bkr3/pp3Bpp/3p4/8/8/4bN2/PPP2nKP/8 b - -',White wants to reduce this hard minor piece block that probably overcame several mates here and there. 
26,0,26,Rf8,b'N2k1r2/pp3Bpp/3p4/8/8/4bNKb/PPP2n1P/8 w - -',Preparing a manouver to mate white. My advantage reduced from +13 to +6. But white's Na8 is doomed. 
27,0,27,Rf6,b'N2k4/pp4pp/3p1r2/3B4/8/4bNKb/PPP2n1P/8 w - -',White's king is trapped in a few move. Can white find a way out? I don't think so but anyway it is nice to see how the mate net works. 
28,0,28,g6#,b'N2k4/pB5p/3p2p1/7K/6r1/4bN1b/PPP2n1P/8 w - -',With all this pieces scattering around the pawn is the one that gives the mate. Hope you enjoyed it and be soon able to refute my lines!

No. Bb4+ and how ever white defends black starts an attack based on Qe7 Ne4 and Bxc4+ (disc.) moves (in different order depending on white's moves) and white will lose the initiative if not more. Good responsed by white are many starting with d3 (the problem of the lsb developement is handled with Be2 it's not aggressive but it is not bad. In some scenarios even g3 - Bg2 is thinkable.

Even at the cost of a queen's exchange. It isolates the d pawn and white's game will be very hard to play. Please note the subtlety of black's threat on c4: white doesn't have to defend it it has to shield the check. He can do it with the knight or the bishop. In both cases black can reinforce the pressure with Bg4 or Nc6-d4. White has to play carefully here. Once the check is shielded c4 is not more in danger. This is the essential point.

206,9,9,Kf2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/2b2P2/1P6/P2P1KPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',White can shield with a minor piece that's right but at the cost of Bxe2 neutralizing the threat on the bishop and finally consolidate the pawn's advantage. White thinks that by gettin the king out of danger he will escape such a fate. And it was not a bad idea but it fails. 
207,9,10,Ne4+,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/8/2b1nP2/1P6/P2P1KPP/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',One of the first reasons f4 was bad was because it left my knight the possibility to do this! White couldn't easily spot the importance of this some moves ago. Still you have to know.
208,9,11,Kf3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/8/2b1nP2/1P3K2/P2P2PP/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',Here my opponent blundered with 8. Ke3 allowing Nc3+(disc.) and I win the queen (but I can mate or very near even if I don't take it quickly). 
209,9,12,Bd5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/3b4/4nP2/1P3K2/P2P2PP/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',This has white in a hell of a trouble. The first threat is the WQeen that can be taken by the knight once it leaves checking the king. And the king can't be easily moved (Kg4 h5+ and back). So the queen must be moved away from the knight's two-moves action. Note that no piece can threat the black bishop except Bc4. Plese explore the following lines after 9. Bc4 Nxd2++! 10. Kf2... and remember that once the d2 pawn is out black threats to have a Q or a B on the great diagonal (a1-h8) and win the Ra1 trapped by the knight.

213,9,16,1Qc5+,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/2qb4/5P2/1P6/P1Qn1KPP/RNB2BNR w kq -',"It is not wise to exchange queens in the attack but just to show black's powerful position and exploiting the ""residual"" threat on the white Ra1 I allowed myself to exchange. This is was because I didn't see a more aggressive move in the position. I may be wrong. Maybe Ne4+ was not so a dull try as it seemed. 
The exchange has also the advantage to bring out my undeveloped dsb which will form a powerful pair against white. 
I have changed from a doubious heckmate threat to a very sure ""ruinous loss of material"". My opponent will be temporarily relieved from the queen's exchange but he is already doomed. "
214,9,17,1Ke1,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bb4/5P2/1P6/P2n2PP/RNB1KBNR b kq -',What else? But now... can you see? c3 has no defence and the rook is trapped by the knight and a bishop can go to d4. This means white will lose a piece as a minimum. But I have the knight's problem to solve. How?
215,9,18,1Nxf1,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bb4/5P2/1P6/P5PP/RNB1KnNR w kq -',White has to retake. A good try is 13. Bb2 but by retreating to Ne3 black saves a piece for the g7 pawn (after Bb2xg7). Black is a piece up then. And don't forget that black can also play Nxh2 because if RxN BxN and black is still up a piece!
216,9,19,Bd4,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3b1P2/1P6/P5PP/RNB2KNR w kq -',This is how it works. White can't save the rook other than interposing the knight and losing it. There are no other moves I can see to get him out of this.

415,18,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White plays the Reti Opening which is not an opening I usually see. 
416,18,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',I respond with d5. My usual response to most opening moves back at that time was e5 but with the knight positioned where it is that would of lost me a pawn so d5 was my preferred alternative. This as well continued the Reti Opening. 
417,18,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',The Reti continues.
418,18,3,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is called the Reti Accepted. Generally if I see an opportunity gain a free pawn I take it. 
419,18,4,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Obviously white likes the Reti as he continues with the Reti Accepted.  
420,18,5,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq b6',I knew hardly anything about other opening moves so I end the Reti with b5. This is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. True for if white plays a4 the next move black can defend but white gains a slight advantage. 
421,18,6,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2p5/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White does not play a4 which of course is an inaccuracy by the computer analysis.  
422,18,7,cxb3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I figure it is best to take. 
423,18,8,Bxb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1B6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Well I did not see that coming but this is easy to counter.
424,18,9,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1B6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is a good move for now white must save their bishop instead of attack the b3 pawn so black can still have a small material advantage. 
425,18,10,bxa2,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/8/2B5/4PN2/p2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I take as I hoped but of course that pawn is lost.
426,18,11,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/8/2B5/2N1PN2/p2P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',? I was a bit puzzled by this move. White could of easily played Bxa2 or Rxa2 but instead chose to save their knight. True the pawn is still lost and although the computer analysis says nothing about this in my view they might as well got it over with now.
427,18,12,Rxa2,b'rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/8/2B5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQK2R b Kkq -',Now white plays Rxa2. It's pretty obvious that white will castle king-side. 
428,18,13,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQ1RK1 b kq -',Yep I was correct a king-side castle. 
429,18,14,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/1bB5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQ1RK1 w kq -',I hope to trade the knight and bishop. 
430,18,15,Bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/1Qb1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w kq -',I take the knight as I planned and of course white will take the bishop but the computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I can not really see the reason why but since it's only an inaccuracy it would not give black a bad disadvantage. The best move was a5. True for then both the pawn and the bishop would of protected each other and white would not attack with one of their powerful pieces. 
431,18,16,1Qxc3,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2Q1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 b kq -',That was the expected move.
432,18,17,1O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2Q1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w - -',I now castle. Get ready though this game is about to become blunderful! 
433,18,18,1Ng5,b'rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B5/2Q1P3/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 b - -',This would be the first of many mistakes and blunders. Ng5 was viewed as a mistake by the computer analysis. This is so because if this sequence followed: 12. ... Nd5 13. Bxd5 cxd5 14. Nf3 ... Black would gain a advantage ever so slightly not in material but in position but not much. The best move for white here was Qa5 an attack on black's queen that likely would of ended up being a queens exchange. 
434,18,19,1h6,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/6N1/2B5/2Q1P3/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w - -',Black would not play Nd5 but instead h6 to drive away the knight. This is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. Although as stated earlier Nd5 was the best move this move doesn't really give black a disadvantage but it doesn't give black an advantage either for white will of course protect their knight.
435,18,20,1Ba3,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/6N1/2B5/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 b - -',I was not expecting this move. What I didn't see though was the mistake white had made. Based on the computer analysis if this sequence is played: 13. ... hxg5 14. Bxf8 Qxf8 black would gain an advantage in material by +1. Although black's rook would be lost both white's bishop and knight would be lost and those pieces are worth more together than 1 rook. The best move here was Nf3 to just simply protect the knight. Unfortunately for black when it came to having their powerful pieces attacked...
436,18,21,1Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/6N1/2B5/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 w - -',...he did not want them taken. I did not see the advantage I could gain mainly because I didn't like having my rooks taken unless it was a fair exchange but that was not the case here so I played this move. Of course this was a mistake and hxg5 was the best move.
437,18,22,1Nxf7,b'rnbqr1k1/p4Np1/2p1pn1p/8/2B5/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 b - -',??? This is a puzzling move. White takes the f7 pawn but there are no other white pieces on that square so now the knight is lost and black gains a big advantage. Of course computer analysis views this as a mistake. The best move was again Nf3 protecting the knight.
438,18,23,1Kxf7,b'rnbqr3/p4kp1/2p1pn1p/8/2B5/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 w - -',I can only take with my king so if white wanted me to bring out my king some then it worked but black still has a good advantage.
439,18,24,Ba6,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/b1p1pn1p/8/8/B1QBP3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 w - -',I'm hoping to exchange bishops here.
440,18,25,1Bc4,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/b1p1pn1p/8/2B5/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 b - -',Interesting move. This doesn't give white any advantage and the computer analysis views this as a mistake. I view it more as an inaccuracy because black really doesn't gain any big advantage. The best move was Bxa6 which is pretty obvious. 
441,18,26,1Ne4,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/b1p1p2p/8/2B1n3/B1Q1P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 w - -',Although Bxc4 was probably the best move I see an opportunity to attack white's queen so I take it. 
442,18,27,1Qd4,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/b1p1p2p/8/2BQn3/B3P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 b - -',This was a bad move a blunder from the computer analysis. This sequence shows why: 17. ... Qxd4 18. exd4 Bxc4 19. d3 Bxa2 20. dxe4. This sequence would of left black with a massive advantage for although there would of been a fair queens exchange then black's bishop could of not only taken white's c4 bishop but also that bishop would of been lined up on both of white's rooks and since white would have no way of taking the bishop one of those rooks were lost. If white played d3 then after black took the a2 rook white could take the e4 knight but it would of left black with a +8 advantage. The best move for white would of been Qc2 which is true for that move would of protected white's queen and attacked black's knight as well.
443,18,28,1Bxc4,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/2p1p2p/8/2bQn3/B3P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 w - -',Alas I completely overlooked that fantastic opportunity and took white's c4 bishop and gave him the option to attack either my knight or my bishop. Of course my bishop because it was attacking both of white's rooks. Of course this was a blunder because I missed this great opportunity. I think you all know what the best moves were.  
444,18,29,1Qxc4,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/2p1p2p/8/2Q1n3/B3P3/R2P1PPP/5RK1 b - -',As expected the bishop goes. 
445,18,30,1Nxd2,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/2p1p2p/8/2Q5/B3P3/R2n1PPP/5RK1 w - -',Now black is falling apart. This seems like a good move but it's actually a blunder. True since black's queen is protecting the knight this move should lose white a rook but white would easily counter. The best move was Qd5. This would begin black's downfall. 
446,18,31,1Qf4+,b'rn1qr3/p4kp1/2p1p2p/8/5Q2/B3P3/R2n1PPP/5RK1 b - -',White counters by putting black in check. Black will have to protect his king and white would then be able to save their rook. 
447,18,32,2Rd1,b'rn1qr1k1/p5p1/2p1p2p/8/5Q2/B3P3/R2n1PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Now black can't move his knight without losing his queen. 
448,18,33,2Nd7,b'r2qr1k1/p2n2p1/2p1p2p/8/5Q2/B3P3/R2n1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',I decide that the knight is lost and thus I use my other knight to protect my queen. This is actually a mistake from the computer analysis but there was not much better to do. Even the best move Qd3 still would of left black with a disadvantage. 
449,18,34,2Rdxd2,b'r2qr1k1/p2n2p1/2p1p2p/8/5Q2/B3P3/R2R1PPP/6K1 b - -',The d2 knight goes as expected but computer analysis views Rdxd2 as a mistake and that Raxd2 was the best move. This is true because with Raxd2 white has a lined up on a attack for black's queen unlike with the move you now see. So white gains an advantage with Raxd2 in regards to position but even though that was not the move made white is still gaining back the advantage. 
450,18,35,2g5,b'r2qr1k1/p2n4/2p1p2p/6p1/5Q2/B3P3/R2R1PPP/6K1 w - g6',I decide to attack white's queen with this move but this is a blunder. It doesn't really seem like it though but if white plays Qe4 they get in a dangerous position for black that could lose black their queen. It can even risk checkmate partially because of black's bishop. Computer analysis predicts the following sequence because of this: 22. Qe4 Re7 23. Bxe7 Qxe7. I would of never seen it and would of lost it big time but fortunately for black white would not play Qe4 but it would still get worse for black. 
451,18,36,2Qg4,b'r2qr1k1/p2n4/2p1p2p/6p1/6Q1/B3P3/R2R1PPP/6K1 b - -',White plays Qg4. This is viewed as a blunder by the computer analysis and as discussed already Qe4 was the best move. Black is still in a bit of a precarious position.
452,18,37,2Rb8,b'1r1qr1k1/p2n4/2p1p2p/6p1/6Q1/B3P3/R2R1PPP/6K1 w - -',Well with my options getting limited I decide to see if I can line up for any attack. I still have a +1 material advantage so all hope is not lost. This move though would be yet another mistake. Again it is because of that dangerous attack if white plays Qe4 but of course I did not see that still.
453,18,38,2Ra1,b'1r1qr1k1/p2n4/2p1p2p/6p1/6Q1/B3P3/3R1PPP/R5K1 b - -',Yet again a mistake from the computer analysis and Qe4 was the best moved. To be honest this is getting old.
454,18,39,2Qa5,b'1r2r1k1/p2n4/2p1p2p/q5p1/6Q1/B3P3/3R1PPP/R5K1 w - -',Well I wanted to make something happen so I decide to attack the d2 rook that was now no longer protected by the other rook. Yet I completely overlooked a big blunder that by moving my queen the d7 knight was completely unprotected by the d2 rook. The best move was Qf6 which would of stopped the attack if white moved his queen to Qe4. 
455,18,40,2Rxd7,b'1r2r1k1/p2R4/2p1p2p/q5p1/6Q1/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',White sees the opportunity and now has the advantage. 
456,18,41,2Red8,b'1r1r2k1/p2R4/2p1p2p/q5p1/6Q1/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 w - -',Well truth be told I was getting better at chess but I'm better today than I was then. Even though this game was only 2 months ago as of when I annotated this game I played like 50 simultaneous games. It's lower today and I focus more on my moves unlike this game where I made yet another blunder. Qf5 was the best move and I don't think I need to explain why again. This was a bigger blunder though because if white plays Qxe6+ this becomes a automatic mate in 3 for white.
457,18,42,2Re7,b'1r1r2k1/p3R3/2p1p2p/q5p1/6Q1/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',I do not see the full point of this move unless he wants to make sure that the e6 pawn is his. Of course Qxe6+ was the best move and this was a blunder.
458,18,43,2Qb6,b'1r1r2k1/p3R3/1qp1p2p/6p1/6Q1/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 w - -',I continued to completely overlook the risk of checkmate because I saw checkmate myself. My hope was to attack on b1 for the king could not escape if my attack was successful. There would be no way for white to avoid checkmate but I think we all know why this was yet another blunder but this time... 
459,18,44,2Qxe6+,b'1r1r2k1/p3R3/1qp1Q2p/6p1/8/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',...white saw the opportunity that was available. I looked hard for a counter but all I saw was checkmate...
460,18,45,2Kf8,b'1r1r1k2/p3R3/1qp1Q2p/6p1/8/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 w - -',...so with no way out I decided to give it to him.
461,18,46,2Qf7#,b'1r1r1k2/p3RQ2/1qp4p/6p1/8/B3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',Checkmate. the1trueseeker is better than his rating. In fact if you look him up his rating is now around mine not 1039. I think he's a pretty good player. Both this game and game 1 were pretty good. I hope you enjoyed this annotation. Feel free to comment and rate it. I'll have more great annotations in the near future.
462,19,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is a decent game where white plays a queen sac which trough blacks blunder lead to a won game.

It seems a normal move and it is playable but you must know about what are you giving up: the possibility to play c5 at some point unless the knight goes away and it won't be easy...

Black already gave up the c5 advance and now gives up the square f5 to his lsb. The possibility to play Bf5 by black is assured for the moment by the a3 pawn that avoids Bb4 by white. So Bf5 could have been at least coherent with a3. I understand that black wants to shield himself but this strategy seldom works and you have to be very very good to play for that. 
481,20,5,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Inviting an exchange since black thinks that allowing NxN by white would debilitate his pawns so he has to defend with Bd7 and this allows white to play NxB something you would normally avoid. But this is not the case: Bd2 was a good move since the white bishop is caged in (unless black wants to try a queenside pawnstorm) so it is less important than the well placed white knight. 
482,20,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/3pn3/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',this seems harmless but see: 
483,20,7,Ne4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pP3/4nB2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',If white exchanges the knight the pawn wall in the center would be a headache for both players but white's queenside will reveal all its weakness since the dsb is caged kinside. No white doesn't have to wait for that: it is very important now white takes the initiative in a rather surprising way:
484,20,8,Qg4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pP3/4nBQ1/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Black can't now get the bishop out without exposing g7. Of course black can chase the queen with h5 but this is what white wants: to provoke troubles on the kingside so not to allow black to expand on the queenside. 
485,20,9,Nxd2,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pP3/5BQ1/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This makes black happy: his knight found its fate but with the honour of having put the white king on an exposed center. And he is completely right: white is probably doomed here but... let's my opponent to demostrate it. 
486,20,10,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3p3/4P3/3p1BQ1/4P3/PPPK1PPP/R4B1R w kq -',Good. This threat has to be handled with great care since any other move gets white in real trouble.

It made the game very labor-intensive.  I could not just make a quick move.  Every move from then on required my entire attention for sometimes up to 30 to 45 minutes--and even then I'd sometimes put the move off until a later time if I wasn't close to timing out.

Still I felt that with white's pawns spread out and mine more aligned to properly protect I could take advantage of the natural defense that white's pawns were providing me and gradually work my queen back down to where I had carefully placed my rook to keep the white queen from a very simple checkmate if I were to leave the sixth row unprotected.

But this game is very interesting from perspective of how important it is to stay focused and to always consider the strength of your pieces when they are strategically aligned and taking advantage of their increased defensive capabilities when kept close to the side of one's king or a pawn.  This game also demonstrates that small moves are sometimes the only move available and when coupled with a small move in another piece can result in a more drastic change of circumstances.  At the time I decided to make this game annotated (following the white Queen's capture of Black rook on move 48) I had just for the first time since move 12 evened the score at -0- again. And both players had exactly the same pieces on the board.  There had been 10 moves to check the king the first three came from white and the last 7 came from black.  From move
540,22,16,e1=N+,b'8/7p/7k/1Pq3p1/P5P1/5Q1P/6K1/4n3 w - -',"And now for the crowning move of my now certain victory: I advance my pawn at e2 for promotion or in this case ""under-promotion"" to a knight enjoining white's queen and king in a fork.  Any other move or even the choice of queen for promotion would have led to my defeat.  Given the position of white's queen I initially considered moving my queen to c2 which would have protected my pawn while still allowing room to guard my king if white chose to put me in check by moving his queen to f6. But had I done this white would most likely have gone for the ensuing queen trade since this would have left him with a considerable advantage: I would have no way of protecting my pawn at e2 from capture by white's king and I would not be able to prevent white's pawn at b5 from promoting.  Other than the aforementioned moves I also considered one other way to prevent white from checkmating and that was to move my king to g6. This would prevent the next move checkmate but it would leave my pawn at e2 unprotected and it was my only hope of winning and that little pawn almost won the game for me single-handedly.   If anyone else could envision another possible way for black to achieve victory following white's move at 51 I would like to know.  By the way this game followed the first game between white and drmra4 in which white won and his win was more decisive than mine.  I'm looking forward to our next match-up! 

Chat at the time: 
white: Great choice Good job..... That's why i hate horses
drmra4: It did not occur to me that I should go for the knight promotion until after I had gone through almost every other possible scenario twice or even three times and saw that you would have prevailed. And thinking I am going to check one more time and see if there was something I had missed...and there it was...the perfect solution! I was really very fortunate that the pieces were exactly where they were otherwise you most certainly would have won. I am not saying you haven't won yet just saying you would have definitely won if it weren't for the ability to choose any piece for promotion. "

Before I started the Baseman Defense thread between my club and WTWLR club I told him that this was the one.  He said that it wasn't an option and picked the defense.  It's the once that I'm used.
827,29,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I also told him that I know how to play against it since I've played the Open Variation against Jack Stockel.

Therefore he decided to play the closed defense.  I believe this is the Nadjorf but could be wrong.  Anyway getting used to something different still means making the most logical move and in this case it's the same variations as though it were the Open Variation.
829,29,3,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p4n2/3Pp3/8/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',??In this position the idea was to exchange right away which is why I played this.  The idea being is that my OTB coach recently emphasized that it's generally a good idea to exchange early when you're up against a much stronger player.  Especially players like andywm.  And there's a little bit of theory behind it as well.  The reason for this is that the really strong players know how to organize their pieces and get an advantage.  By exchanging you get rid of that obstacle.  However this is a time and place to do so.  According to the post game analysis this is an inaccuracy.  And best was 8.Nbd2. The reason is that black would 8...Nc6 Note everything is safe.  The idea being is that the e pawn would remain right on the e file prevent black from attacking my N and B.  Afterwards we'd wind up with something like 9.0-0 Be7 10.exd5 Nxd5 11.Nc4 Nxe3 12.fxe3 Bg4 13.Be4 f6 14.Bxc6+ bxc6 15.Qe2  And I like the way that position looks as it would result in a good and close game between Andy and I with material even rather then 2 points down. Having said that I disagree that this is just an inaccuracy when it comes to this move.  Looks good but what looks good might be bad.  And this is a perfect example.  As it turns what I played here is a blunder because it loses a piece for a pawn after he forks my N and LSB with 8...e4
830,29,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p4n2/3P4/2B1p3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',?! The idea behind this is that I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn.  And here I have to decide what that piece is going to be.  Given that it appears to be an open position I decided to let him have my N as opposed to the B.  So there is a strategy behind.  According to the post computer analysis however this is an inaccuracy.  Best was 9.Bxe4 with the idea of 9...Nxe4 10.0-0 Bf5 11.Qd4 Be7 12.Qe5 Bg6 13.Nbd2 Nxd2 14.Bxd2 f6 15.Qe2 Bxc2  This time I agree that it's just an inaccuracy but not for all of the reasons that the computer outlines except for the beginning as it mentions 10.0-0  From my POV after 9...exf3 it will no longer be safe to castle K side.  And even with best play now K exposure is something to worry about.  So already black has a noticeable advantage.
831,29,5,1Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p4n2/1p1P4/8/3BBP2/PPP2P1P/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',The idea wasn't just a retreat but to establish a strong bishop pair.  They say when your B's are only one space from each other whether vertical or horizontal you have a strong bishop pair.  According to the analysis however this is a mistake.  Best was 11.Bb3 then comes 11...Bb4+ 12.c3 Bd6 13.a4 Bb7 14.axb5 axb5 15.Rxa8 Bxa8 16.Qd3 b4 17.Nd2 bxc3 18.bxc3 0-0  Unlike before however I disagree with this analysis.  In my mind this move is just as good and effective as Bb3.  First I looked at the result of this variation compared to what happens here in the 7 moves and I like the position just as well.  Second this move establishes the double bishop I like to call it whereas the other move does not since they would not only be one space from each other.
832,29,6,2Rhe1+,b'4k2r/r5pp/p7/2bP1b2/2B2p2/5P2/PP5P/2KRR3 b - -',"?? Ok the idea wasn't just to check as otherwise I wouldn't have played.  It was to place him in check by bringing those R's together or as some call it communicate both R's.  It's said that this kind of check is dangerous.  And I've won a couple of games with these types of checks.  According to the analysis however this is an inaccuracy.  Best was 25.Bd3 followed by 25...Bd7 26.Rhe1+ Be3+ 27.Kb1 Ke7 28.Re2 Kd6 29.h4 Rc7 30.Rh2 Bd4 31.Bxa6 Kxd5 32.Bd3 Be3 33.Bxh7+ Bd4 34.Be4+ Ke5  I agree with the analysis.  I checked the position after the variation and I like it way better then what's going to happen here.  And it will take less then 9 moves to feel the negative consequences of this choice.  In fact the only thing I disagree with like before is that this is more then just an inaccuracy.  It's an outright blunder.  In addition to what I've already this move loses a R for a B.  However the game is not lost until later and as I wind up in trouble I'm getting more and more confident.  Note: The confidence is good because it prevents me from resigning and prevents and/or takes away the ""fight or flight"" syndrome.  And by getting more confident in these kinds of situations this is actually why I've been able to pull swindles including a game against Jack Stockel where I was once a piece down and in at a serious disadvantage.  Yet I was able I got braver and more confident and by doing so I was able to pull a win against a my coach despite a lost position.  "
833,29,7,3Rg1,b'4r3/6pp/3k4/p2P1b2/2BK1p2/1P2rP2/P6P/6R1 b - -',?? I was not intending to win a pawn here as it appears here.  The idea was to give black something to think about and make it easy for him to go wrong.  However his plan all along was for me to take that pawn for once I did he would immidetialy mate me as I found out. Like I said earlier I keep getting more and more confident.  Two things.  First according to the computer analysis this is a blunder.  Best was 33.a3 Be4 34.Rc1 Bxf3 35.Bd3 Bxd5 36.Rg1 R8e5 37.Rg4 g5 38.h4 h6 39.hxg5 hxg5 40.b4 axb4 41.axb4  Second according to my opponent this is the losing blunder because with the move played black has an inevitable mating which I'm soon going to discover.  I think that 33.a3 was actually the only way to prevent mate in this position.
834,29,8,3Rxf3,b'4r3/6pp/3k4/p2P1b2/2BK1p2/1P3r2/P6P/6R1 w - -',"And at this point he accurately said ""your options are limited at this point...your last R move was questionable.""  So I said the idea behind the R move was to put pressure on the g pawn.  And he responded towards the end by saying ""you never should have moved the R to g1. g pawn is nothing at that point esp with all the pressure on your K. The K needs Help."""
835,29,9,3a3,b'1r6/6pp/3k4/p2P1b2/2K2p2/PP1r4/7P/6R1 b - -',"Only now do I learn my fate and start losing confidence.  I realize that the game is lost but will still give anything until he has an official mate in one.   Any other move and he has the immediate 36...Rb4#  So this is the only way for now to prevent the mating net.  But as he Andy accurately said ""too late for that now"""
836,29,10,Rb8b5,b'8/6pp/3k4/pr1P4/3K1p2/Pr1b4/7P/R7 w - -',"Now he asked ""do you see anything coming?""  And at first I said no but when we arrived at this position I saw an inevitable mating sequence which he was going to exploit.  It's actually a similar situation to a recent quiz by GM Judit Polgar.  Black has a mate in one and in order to prevent that the K would have to move.  Well it's pinned so that makes it impossible at that point to prevent mate.  So I resigned.  Overall I enjoyed my game against.  But the moral is something is that he pm'd me earlier today.  In it he said ""Here's a synopsis of our game from my perspective: You played the King's pawn opening and I defended with the Sicilian defense Kan variation (Paulsen) and ended with your 5th move according to book play. I thought you played well until your 8th move w/ pxd5. This started troubles for white since I played pe4 and forked your Kn and B and also lead to doubling of your pawns. From here on I was trying to gain control of the middle while also having your pieces retreat. Once my B checked you on move 25 I wanted to keep the pressure on your K weaken your defense while hoping you would make some bad moves defending your K. Once my B captured your R on move 25 your K was pretty much exposed w/o much defense on that rank. You did play reasonably well until move 33 with R g1 that I mentioned during our game. Although you didn't have a good move at that point you abandoned your K and it made it easier for me to attack your K in the middle of the board since I had also brought my K up. From this point on it was just of me keeping the pressure on checking your K and winning pieces and exchanging pieces if necessary. Overall not a bad game to make it last till move 38 but a few mistakes early hurt your play. I hope something was learned from the game.""  BTW I would like to thank andywm for this amazing game and brigadecommander for the thread ""Are All the Walker's Sitting"".  Without it this game would not have been feasible.  And I agree that these WTW games are a great way for people to learn and improve their overall games."

This is a game played in a mini-tournament run by Gerhard/Chicoboy.  This is another game where I have kept it pretty tight and Operation Joblock has again been in full swing.

I could have exchanged Bf5xNb1 trying to force this move but it was not a good idea to lose the two bishop's force so soon... unless the queen could have gonte to a5.

The text has also the advantage of guard g5. I've had a look on Qd2 and if Nh4 Bg5 but c3 then Bh5 g4 Bg6... and NxB. I don't say this is a loser line for black but I just wanted to keep my lsb on the long diagonal. But in doing this...

If I don't create attack and freedom for my pieces my developement would be sterile. Still better for white to develop with Bb5 followed by Ne5. Instead Rb1 invites to RxN NxN BxRb1 NxB and another game begins. Anyway I'm not interested in simplifications. Of course here white can defend the pawn with Qa5 attacking again my lsb... and so on. 
936,34,19,1Nb3,b'3qk1nr/Q1pnbpp1/7p/5b2/3P4/1NP1BN2/P1r2PPP/R3KB1R b KQk -',Maybe looking at b7. Still better was Bb5. 
937,34,20,1Ne5,b'3qk1nr/Q1pnbpp1/7p/4Nb2/3P4/1Nr1B3/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQk -',Ok I've sacrified two developement moves and conceded the semiopen b column... for some reason right? So...

960,35,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black rightly so denies the acceptance of the gambit.

An evaluation suggests how Black's knights are hemmed in but he compensates for this by having central influence and pressure on e4 which is amplified by the tying-down of my c3-knight. On the other hand I have more active pieces than Black.

This includes the d6 and e5-squares - meaning that Black has trouble manoeuvering effectively. Also the fact that Black has now instituted two pawns on the c8-h3 diagonal means that Black's dark-squared bishop is useless. Even if Black could free the a6-square for the stricken bishop It only aims at a pawn chain consisting of four pawns.
 In terms of movement Black could have played 16...b6 but would result in (17.cxb6 axb6 18.Bb4 [else Qxe4] 18...Qf5 19.f3 exf3 20.Qxf5 exf5 +/-) leaving doubled pawns for Black."

When you play with one color the first it's common and generally a good idea to play with the opposite so that you can see how your student will adjust to the different changes.  By doing so you can make different suggestions to help them to improve.  Now after she plays the King's Pawn Opening I said that the same thing that I've said in past games which is As you recall this is the most common opening. Now there are several ways for black to respond but I'm going with the most common variation which is also not too difficult to learn.""  That will be 1...e5.  The idea being is that I could but choose not to play 1...c5  Why?  Because that would be getting her used to the Siclian Defense.  And as other's have mentioned in the first game where I coached despite the fact that the Siclian Defense was one of the first opening that my OTB coach made me learn since it's one of the most studied it's not really a good idea to teach your students because it's more complex and requires a lot more variations.  When you teach you want to start off simple and then gradually make it more complicated.  "

After seeing the comments she said ""i need to let something sink in before I can make my next move""  After that I pointed out something important which is a well known fact because when it comes to training people I like to mention the well known facts.  That is take your time. What I played with 3...Nf6 is called the Four Knights Defense.  Now earlier you played 3.Nc3. There's nothing wrong with this move. But slightly better believe it or not was 3.Bb5 which is the Ruy Lopez. Now that's an aggressive line that is studied by masters and GM's. For example in the world champion chess match between Anand and Carlson they had at least one round that involved the Ruy Lopez and it led to a good game.  And I also said Also letting the information is key to improvement. The way to remember is as someone recently told me which I agree with is that there's very little luck in chess unless of course you're in a lost position and manage to get a draw or win. Otherwise it's about skills and mathematics. One thing that I enjoy about coaching and mentoring is getting students to become familiar with the process and taking time to process the information is a very good way to do that."

Meaning: That I didn't expect her to answer the question but I decided to give her something to think about because thinking about these things is a way to become a better said.  The concept I gave was Before I make another move suppose that I had played something other then 1...e6 how would you respond? Would you have still played 2.Nf3 or would you have responded differently? The reason I ask is that I've noticed that with many different opening you've played 2.Nf3 I understand why because it develops a piece and development is important. For example if black had played 1...e6 as opposed to 1...e5 then 2.Nf3 would not be a good move. Instead 2.d5 would be the best response. So the idea is meeting the exchange that when your opponent plays something that you're not accustomed to the idea is to be able to meet the change in that position.  This is a good lesson that I learned some time ago from thereaper1.

I didn't realize this so I wasn't going say anything because I don't want to over do things when it comes to coaching.  I learned about this the hard way when I did that in my last training against the same opponent and I inadvertently gave the wrong advice because there was simply too much.  But after looking at the post game computer analysis and today is the first time I did this according to the computer this is an inaccuracy.  Now according to the analysis best was 5.d3 as after black often replies 5...d6  I agree but at the same time disagree with the assessment.  I agree about 5.d3 but only under the technicality white can free her DSB without losing a anything.  But I disagree that 5...d6 is a good response because this limits the amount of places black's DSB can travel.  However what Erika also shows why were here.  That is ""if you take my pawn then i can get your bishop and then trade off on the knights then I could castle after the trade off that would elave white -1 and black +1""  But this is where I did something different and got the idea from a mentor on GK and then followed by Stalhandske in his game against brigadecommander about the Phillidor's Defense.  I made a suggestion that was bad and then stalhandske as a HW made me figure out on my own why that was so.  The idea being is that it's good training and I agree with it since this is what I do with quizzes from GM Judit Polgar.  And the fact that my OTB chess coach in order to help me learn has done things similar by showing GM games and making answer question to the move I played or was about to play of why it's not good and/or how it loses immediately.  In fact I remembered that quiz to defeat an opponent here as well as Jack Stockel in a couple of past games especially when I was in a hopelessly lost position.  So the quiz which I made her as which was HW is in two stages.  First No. If I don't take you would win my B. But if black takes with N so ...NXP or ...Nxd4 we end up with a pawn exchange. But I don't have the pawn. Quiz: What else can black take with?  Second I don't want to give you too much but it occurred to me and this is another important aspect of absorbing the information. So another thing to note is that I don't have to take in order to avoid losing a piece. So the second part to the HW question is aside from capturing wherelse can my bishop move?  And until I only have a day left to move I will wait to make my next move until you complete the HW assignments meaning: answer these questions. I know how difficult this is but it's also very important because trying to figure out the answers is what it takes to become a better chess player believe it or not. And I don't want to do things too quickly as I want to give you time to answer the questions.  Then I said I also know why it's difficult because this used to be my weakness too. "

While I thought that this was the best way to retake according the post game analysis this move is a mistake and best was to capture with the e pawn for after 5...exd4 then 6.Nb5 Nxe4 7.0-0 0-0 8.Bd5 Nf6 9.Bg5 Be7 10.Bb3 Na5 11.Qxd4 Nxb3 12.axb3  Note: That computers are not always accurate.

The idea is to ""castle early and often"".

Yes if I had taken with the e pawn so played 5...exd4 instead then white could respond with 6.f4 and I wouldn't be able to take with 6...Nxe5 as that would lose a piece for a pawn. So then black would have to give up tempii in order to save his N when the time is needed to develop. Of course I am going to castle but in this position I was considering to take your e pawn. But 7...Nxe4?? is a very serious blunder.  It's not super serious but actually is a mistake. It's a complicated position and might take a while to answer the question. In an unusual this mistake would be serious. However it isn't a HW assignment but rather a quiz because one thing to help someone improve is also be quizzing them to see what they know. One way or another I'll answer. The idea is to see if you can figure out why in this case ""To take is a mistake"" in this situation."

So I admitted the error by saying I was hoping that you'd answer it but this time the question I gave was too difficult. The real answer is that 7...Nxe4?? is a blunder because if the N captures white can 8.Qd5. So black would have to lose a piece or expose his K.  The idea being is that the only place where black's N can retreat without losing a piece right then and there but at the same time defending the mate is with 8...Nd6 but that's then met with 9.Ba4 which becomes pretty much the same situation.  And it's more complicated then that. Instead of 9.Ba3 white has an even more powerful threat with 9.Ng5 and to make matters more complicated with Black's DSB white can't take the N. And even if mate wasn't feasible right away black would have a very difficult to position and be in quite a bit of trouble as all of white's minor pieces would be working against the K. So in this case K safety is important. My idea is for you to see this because an important part of thinking and planning ahead is by preparing for something that you didn't expect.

""in this case is double pawn a bad thing""  It's very good because archduke_piccolo told me to erase all fears about doubled pawns.  And later he told me that it's not always a bad thing and depended upon the position.  This time my response was the same that ION implied when I said In this case it is a little bit of a weakness but it's not by any means super bad. It's just that the two pawns on one file seperates e pawn from the c pawns. So it's said to also be isolated pawns since they're not all connected to one another. It's not so bad unless or until it reaches the endgame. That's when pawn structures become important because what it usually takes to get a passed pawns are all of the pawns connected."

It's not checkmate but you would win my Q if I'm not careful. However there is one way for black to get out of this situation. HW: How can black get out of trouble?  Note: It doesn't directly but rather indirectly prevents white from playing 10.Nf7  The reason I give you this assignment is because as noted black can out of trouble in this position. That's also something important that's important to think about in your actual rated games. It's about what can your opponent do and how can he or she respond because chess is not easy where if I move here then my opponent must move there or my opponent will lose something. The way to remember this is as GM Judit Polgar once said ""Chess is a very complex game and full of interesting ideas."" Actually there are two moves that black can make to avoid losing his Q. But one move in exchange loses a R. So it's down to one move that keeps everything safe so by getting out of trouble this is what I'm alluding to.  Then she said ""you have move the queen to e7""  So my response was Yes 9...Qe7 protects the Q but it's not the best move because it still loses a R after 10.Bxf7 because black cannot take back with 10...Qxf7 do to the g N. But there is one move that will keep things safe and only loses a pawn. But there is only way that black can do this."

In a case like that I understand. Being 26 points only if you only have a Q with the opponent having much on very rare occasions lead to a stalemate. But generally it's over when you're that far behind. Which game was this?  What that means is not to resign just because a piece is left attacked or like if you're down by a piece even a Q or possibly a little more.

But if QXB meaning that I capture with the Q then you could take my Q. However while you do win a pawn back I can take back with my N. What you said is very true that I have to develop my remaining piece but defending material is of even more importance.  What you said for the most part was correct but there's more to it then meets the eye. The idea behind 9...d5 was to cut the bishop's diagnol because your LSB was dangerous. With your B on c4 combined with your g5 N and DSB you were threatening to win at the very least my R. Had I not cut it down with 9...d5 this would've happened and I could not allow it. So now this is an instructive. Yes development is very important. But even more important is trying to find a way out of trouble and defending material. Note: Before I played ...d5 black was in a lot of trouble. But by thinking about it I got out of the situation. Being able to do that won't just help you in chess but in life as well. There are certain situations where you're faced with obstacles and problems and knowing how to overcome these obstacles is a way to achieve your goals.  BTW I said all this with a smiley face.

The reason why is she studied a video about connected pawns that I showed.  So the idea was to get connect her c and e files and reconnect her pawns meaning eliminate her doubled pawns so that one of her pawns would remain on c4 whereas the other would be on d5.  The idea behind it is to promote.  Normally this kind of thing would work but in the endgame.  The problem here is that it's a blunder and not because of what the game analysis mentions at all.  Had she taken white would've compensated for lost material and in fact would wind up a point ahead.  However with this move I can and will force an exchange increasing my advantage.  But what she said was alarming to me and raised a red flag.  That is ""you knight is in danger so you would have to move your knight""  So my response was You make a very good point that my d5 N is in danger. That's true but I don't have to move it per say. If I take on g5 then even if white captures on d5 you have an even exchange. Now an even exchange=exchanging something worth the same value. e.g. N for N. B for B. Or if you exchanged Q's. Note: And this is a very important concept and what I mean by preparing for the unexpected.  You said that I must move my N. Now until recently I made this mistake thinking ok I'm attacking here and since I'm about to win something he must do this to defend. However ""it's not so easy"" as my coach puts it. There's always more to a story then meets the eye. This is where you want to ask yourself what else can my opponent do as opposed to inferring that he must play something else. That's because planning so as were the case here that's is cause preplanning a move because presumably he has to do respond about it and has a difficult position to defend. But then he or she plays something that you didn't expect but is just as good or even better can spell disaster.  A very good example that is while I was still having problems was with a mentor here. My Knight was well placed where it originally was. Now I moved to fork his pieces. I thought that the position was very difficult to defend both and he could only make one move that would do this. And once he made that move I would have the advantage. But I was wrong. He caught me off guard and made a move that I didn't expect. So the joke was on me because I was then forced to move the attacker 5 times back to it's original when it should've only stayed on one. And the mentor told me more or less the same thing."

Note: as some might recall my first lost against the Master Mater which jstevens1 annotated and called it ""Back with a Vengeance""  And in the end I mentioned that I used some of his strategies to defeat my opponent and game an example of such.  Well this is even better and almost identical as this same threat is almost identical so stay tuned. "

Unfortunately this is the move that's going to seal her fate once and for all.  Note: This ironically is the same mistake that I made against the Master Mater.  When I was in trouble I decided to kick his Q figuring that I got out of it.  But what I overlooked was the mate in one which he did take advantage of in the exact same way ironically.  That was his LSB+Q.  While it might appear differently this by my standards is the losing blunder and not her previous move QXP.  In order to prevent mate white's only move was to move her g pawn.  But when she does that I take and capture her R with 13...gxf1+  In other words white would be this time forced to give up her R for my B in order to prevent mate.  Note: if you lose a lot of material even against a much stronger opponent you still have chances of counterplay and are sometimes able to turn a loss into a draw or win henceforth a swindle.  I know because I have pulled such swindles against Mr. Stockel in hopeless positions but once you leave yourself vulnerable to a mating sequence that's when it's over.  That is when the opponent takes advantage of that weakness which is what you typically see.
1039,37,18,1Qxg2#,b'r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3Qp3/2P1PP2/B6b/P1P3qP/R4RK1 w - -',"Overall reachforgoals played this game extremely well.  The performance in this game was far north of her rating.  In my mind she played like an 1100.  However the game was quite instructive with a lot to learn.  @Erika: The morals of this game is that if you're in trouble don't panick.  Instead as Mr. Stockel puts it ""Try to find a way out of trouble.""  An example was when I played 9...d5 when I was in trouble.  Second ""expect the unexpected"" and to ""be ready for anything and everything.  For example instead of hesitating when I had something to think about after getting out of trouble knowing that I could wind up in that situation.  And you were doing damage with your Bishop and Q.  So I figured it out by answering and recapturing with 10...Nxd5  The other concept of preparing for the unexpected is not assuming well if I do this then this is how my opponent must respond because there might and usually is something that he or she can do which is just a good yet you never expect.  When that happens you're often in worse shape.  Third ""be a spectator of your game.""  That means look at the entire board and not just one or two moves.  The perfect example was after I played 12...Bh3 you were interested in hitting my Q with 13.f4.  Now had you seen the immediate mating thread you would've advanced the h pawn.  In addition to what happened with the Master Mater this is a mistake that I made against Mr. Stockel one time.  I was in a lot of trouble but he made a mistake that I overlooked an immediate back rank mate.  As instead I hyperfocused on getting out of trouble henceforth.  As soon as I missed it I wound up getting in even more trouble.  So what should've been the winning move became the losing blunder. If you can remember these morals combine with what we said in your past annotations and our first training I'm confident that your rating will surpass 1000 once and for all."
