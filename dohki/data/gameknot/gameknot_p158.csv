18,1,0,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1n1p3/1p6/2pPP3/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An error. White's d-pawn will now be very powerful and the hemming in of white's light-squared bishop is ephemeral since b3 can bust it open at any time.
19,1,1,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p1n1p3/1p6/2pPP3/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Intended to prepare d5. But black doesn't have enough time for this...
20,1,2,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p1n1p3/1p1P4/2p1P3/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',A crucial move securing the advantage allowed by black's mistake. A normal development move would allow black to play d5 with a strong center and light-square control. White may still be slightly better in that situation with a dynamic pawn center but it doesn't seem like a big advantage.
21,1,3,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p1n5/1p1p4/2p1P3/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Natural but not good. Black would be better off with a closed e-file as we will see.
22,1,4,1d6,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p2P4/np6/2p5/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Simply winning a knight. There's nothing black can do anymore.
23,1,5,1Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p1nP4/1p6/2p5/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',No need to take it right away! The knight can't move...why not let it block in its own bishop for awhile before taking it?
24,1,6,1Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p2P4/np6/2p5/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',These ridiculous knight moves show that black has no good ideas in this position. Although a number of moves might have done some good such as Bb7 or Qb6.
25,1,7,1Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pnppp/p2P4/np4B1/2p5/P4N2/BPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',Not really sure if this was necessary. The bishop needed to be developed and I was in a mood to sacrifice pieces for initiative. It might be unsound but worked well in this game.
26,1,8,1Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pn1pp/p2P1p2/np2N1B1/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',Probably wrong but making life complicated for my opponent...
27,1,9,1fxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/3pn1pp/p2P4/np2p1B1/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',The correct move. If the knight isn't taken mate will follow.
28,1,10,Nac6,b'r1bqkb1r/3pn1pp/p1nP4/1p2R1B1/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/RN1Q2K1 w kq -',Now I had to make up for the fact that my queen powerful as she looks can't really do anything in this situation. A tactical withdrawal to Re3 might have been best. As it was I made the unforced trade when I had a positional advantage. Not a good decision on my part...
29,1,11,1Qd6,b'r1bqk2r/3pn1pp/p2Q4/1p2R3/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/RN4K1 b kq -',A good move retaining some of my initiative. I had seen this far ahead and decided that Qd6 would be effective. It was but I'm still not sure it's as good as just quietly waiting until he forced the trades would have been.
30,1,12,2Qg8+,b'2bqk1Q1/r2pn1pp/p4r2/1p2R3/2p5/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Good but maybe not the best. I think that with accurate play black can still get a draw here.
31,1,13,2Nf6,b'2bk4/r1q1n1Q1/p4N2/1p1p1r2/2p5/P3R3/BPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',This move wins the game. Black's best try is probably to trade the rook...Rxf6 Qxf6. But after that the knight is pinned again and therefore the d-pawn is hanging. Black has no counterplay that I can see and that situation would be bad. If he doesn't trade the next move is Qf8 mate or if the queen moves out of the way Qf4+ followed by Rxe7 winning a knight and it won't stop there.
32,1,14,3Rxe7+,b'2b2Q2/r1k1R3/p4N2/1pqp1r2/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Gotta be careful; black would love to get in Qf2+ although he'd still need one more move to setup a mating attack.
33,1,15,Kxc5,b'8/r3R3/p4N2/1pkp1r2/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',At this point it's over...and I was tired. But I sort of suspect that Ne4+ would have been slightly better than Rxa7 which is what I played.
34,1,16,Kc6,b'8/8/p1k1r3/1p1R4/2p5/P7/BPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Now I was really tired...
35,1,17,4c3,b'8/8/5k2/pp6/2p2PP1/P1P2K2/BP5P/8 b - -',Black resigned.
36,2,0,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',The game has now transposed into the QGD Orthodox defense.
37,2,1,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Alekhine's position is cramped but sound. 
38,2,2,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K -',Electing to not try for ...P-QB4 the standard freeing move.

41,2,5,c5,b'r1bqr1k1/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/1pp5/3P3B/P1N1PN2/BPQ2PPP/2R1K2R w K -',Alekhine has eliminated Gruenfeld's spatial advantage and equalized the game.
42,2,6,Qb6,b'r1b1r1k1/3nbpp1/pq2pn1p/1p6/3N3B/P1N1P3/BPQ2PPP/3RK2R w K -',Activating the Q and getting out of the potential pin.

Notice how this position is solid as white cannot force the bishop away with the a2-a3 move and because of the advanced d-pawn.

Lack of development early on and a weak pawn structure lead to quick resolution to the game. White should have developed his knights earlier and tried to castle at the kings side. 
Even if white had sacrificed his bishop on move 12. he would still be in a lot of trouble."

I didn't think I could take time-out to play the limp 12. ...Bd7 to prevent the weakening of my pawns when after 13. Nc4 white is standing very well.  Again since I'm already down material I must continue to play actively to justify the pawn sacrifice and attempt to wrest the intiative in this position.  12. ...O-O breaks the pin brings my KR into play and whisks my king to safety.  Yes safety on white's same half-open h-file.  It seems paradoxical but black's king is much safer here than in the center because white doesn't have the piece coordination to exploit an attack along the h-file.

At least I personally would have been adverse to it.  I could see white's thinking; up material continue to hack wood and simplify splatter black's remaining queenside pawns mop up the positional trumps and eventually win.  Of course chess is often not this simple.  By getting rid of her other bishop black's two bishops become that much more emphatic in a fluid semi-open position such as this and I do gain a nice open b-file for my QR to exert pressure upon.

It seems to consolidate white's extra pawn as a strongpoint on c4 but since I wasn't taking extreme pains to recoup it 14. Qa4 or 14. O-O must be preferred.

My bishops are very actively posted on long diagonals exerting influence on many squares.  I wanted to play ...a5 first because the rook-pawn would be much more useful in front of the bishop than behind it and I figured I could reasonably predict 15. a3 so I could afford the tempo expended.

Nc4 and more importantly the very strong 18. ...f5 is threatened wrenching open the center route to the enemy king.  I had considered the immediate 17. ...f5 but saw after 18. Qb3ch Kh8 19. e5! Re8 20. Nc4 Bxc4 21. Qxc4 Bxe5 (21. ...f6 22. O-O fe 23. Nd6 is annoying to meet) 22. O-O I regain my pawn but white weasels away and I don't even have my two bishops anymore for comfort. With 16. ...Re8 I keep the pressure.  I believe black already has a sizable advantage here.

For one thing it covers the f7 pawn so it doesn't hang after a subsequent ...Kh8.  In some variations I also envisioned it swinging over and doubling up on the e-file.  Again improving the placement of my pieces while forcing white to make accurate replies in a bad defensive position.

I could see white's thinking; free up the f-pawn of defensive maneuvers (18. ...Qg5 19. f4; 18. ...Kh8 19. f4 f5 20. e5 locking up the Lincoln Tunnel) and maybe redevelop it on e2 in some cases.  However it's very slow and dangerous as it's essentially an ""undevelopment"" move in a razor-sharp position."

I intend to deflect the queen off the g8-a2 diagonal so I can play ...f5 immediately or 19. Qa2 play 19. ...Qg5 threatening 20. ...Rxe4! and white cannot play 20. f4 as in the previous position because the white queen no longer covers g3.

I assumed that white just wrote off this knight as a lost piece not worth defending anymore.  In hindsight I see it was a good move since two rooks side by side providing support for two pawns side by side is a really effective tactic.  I've seen pawns and rooks working together like that to clear the file of opposing pieces or walk all the way to the last row.

Black has 3 pieces that can attack e4 while white has only two to defend it - including a rook which is more valuable than any of the black pieces aimed at e4.  I think Ne5 would have been better here than e4.  If 12. Ne5 followed by Nxe5 then dxe5 advancing white's d-pawn beyond a simple pawn exchange to where it can threaten black's remaining knight.  This also opens up the main diagonal for white's light-square bishop which is better defended than black's light-square bishop.

If e5xf4 then Bxf4 and the black pawn on e4 is protected only by the queen.  If e5xf4 it's not wise for the white's rook to capture either the black pawn on either f4 or d4 because the black bishop can move to c5 or d6 to pin white's rook.  White's decision to advance the f-pawn has a major downside that will prove the undoing of white's entire game later - white's king no longer has any pawns near it and black can move the bishop to c5 for a later discovered check.  If white really needed to advance the f-pawn white could have moved the king to h1 and then move the bishop to g1 to prevent any potential of a discovered check.

24. Rxf1+ Rxf1+ opens up the f file completely for black's remaining rook.

503,21,2,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq f3',black still has the option of e5 seeing as neither black nor white wants to exchange on e5 right away.
504,21,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The point of the early f5 being I want to strike in the center and put pressure on the e5 point black will tend to try to undermine the e4 point and control the d5 square.
505,21,4,Nd5,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/3Np3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! not sure I like this move so much any more looks to lose a pawn on e4 but white may be able to win it back.

Black has a few options here the best I feel is to play Ndf6 then an exchange would occur Nxf6 Nxf6 fxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 O-O O-O Black would seem to have initiative and Bf6 would take control of the dark square diagonal.
507,21,6,1Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbppp/p4n2/3NN3/2B5/8/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',The position I saw a few moves ago white has a very strong position with one big flaw his king is rather airy.

512,21,11,Kh8,b'r1bqr2k/1p1n1B1p/p4p2/2b1N3/8/8/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2R1K w - -',Kf8  Bh6+ Ke7 Bxe8 and white is not bad off. Kg7 Qg4+ Kh8 Bh6 leads to a good game for white.

515,21,14,2Bd2,b'r1b1B3/1p1n2k1/p4pp1/2b5/8/8/PPPB2PP/R4R1K b - -',?? traps the bishop on e8 better is Bxd7.
516,21,15,Bf5,b'r3B3/1p4k1/p4pp1/2b1nb2/8/2B5/PPP3PP/R4R1K w - -',? Black allows white to give back the exchange leaving white okay positionally.
517,21,16,2Bh5,b'r7/1p4k1/p4p2/2b1np1B/8/2B5/PPP3PP/R6K b - -',Still up a pawn.

519,21,18,2Re1,b'r7/1p4k1/p4p2/2b5/6p1/2B5/PPP3PP/4R2K b - -',? this positional error could have ended white for good black has the very strong g3!! and forces h3 for hxg3 Rh8# and h3 black finishes up with Rd8 and now the rook is locked down as well.
520,21,19,2g3,b'3r4/1p4k1/p4p2/2b5/6p1/2B3P1/PPP4P/4R2K b - -',Every so happy to get the right move out.  White had nothing to fear from g3 Re8 Re1.
521,21,20,2Re6,b'7r/1p6/p3Rpk1/2b5/6p1/2B3P1/PPP3KP/8 b - -',gaining an attacking position this allows white to free up his king from the defense of the h2 pawn.
522,21,21,Kf5,b'5r2/1p6/p3Rp2/2b2k2/6p1/2B3PP/PPP3K1/8 w - -',a move I didn't see though forcing the white rook back.
523,21,22,Bd6,b'5r2/1p6/p2b1p2/5k2/8/2B3PK/PPP1R3/8 w - -',Attacking the g3 pawn but opens up the white rook to keep the black rook in to passivity.
524,21,23,3g4,b'5r2/1p6/p2bkp2/8/6P1/2B4K/PPP2R2/8 b - -',gets the pawn out of the bishops scope.
525,21,24,Be5,b'7r/1p6/p3kp2/4b3/6P1/2B5/PPP2RK1/8 w - -',not sure this is best for black seeing as all trades would seem to favor white.
526,21,25,3Re2,b'7r/1p6/p3k3/4p3/6P1/8/PPP1R1K1/8 b - -',restraining the pawn and the black king for the moment.
527,21,26,3c4,b'4r3/1p6/p3k3/4p3/2P3P1/8/PP2R1K1/8 b - c3',keeps the black king out of the position I plan to play b3 and move my king to the e4 square trying to gain some kind of initiative.
528,21,27,3b5,b'4r3/8/p3k3/1p2p3/2P3P1/8/PP2R1K1/8 w - b6',? this positional error allows with to use his rook to defend every pawn at once with little worry.  cxb5 axb5 a3 and the white rook can come to b4 keeping the rains on black.  Not to mention it trades down pawns.
529,21,28,4Kf3,b'r7/8/4k3/1p2p3/6P1/P4K2/1P2R3/8 b - -',moving the king closer to e5 pawn.
530,21,29,4Ra4,b'8/8/4k3/1p2p3/r5P1/P4K2/1P2R3/8 w - -',? white gains a tempo with Re4.
531,21,30,Kd5,b'8/8/8/1p1kp3/r3R1P1/P4K2/1P6/8 w - -',final trades black cannot win defend both weaknesses.
532,21,31,4Ke3,b'8/8/8/3kp3/p5P1/P3K3/1P6/8 b - -',I play this move to force black to decide on Kc4 or Ke6 both are losing.
533,21,32,4Ke4,b'8/8/4k3/4p3/p3K1P1/P7/1P6/8 b - -',Black Resigns.

537,22,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Too many times when that move is played against me I would block with my bishop and stop attacking so I forced myself to ignore that and play Qxf3 if black chose Bxf3
538,22,4,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Continues development

Nh4 leaving his only option as Bf7 again checkmate....kinda annoyed at myself after going thru the lines that I missed Qd7 but anyway...this move was played and I began to re-avaluate
542,22,8,Nd4,b'r3kbnr/pppq2pp/2np1p2/3Q4/2BNP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I realised after some deliberation that Nd4 Nxd6 was a possibility for mate if he decided to take with the Queen over his pawn structure but knew it was unlikely because he had only just played Qd7 for a reason
543,22,9,Nxc6,b'r3kbnr/pppq2pp/2Np1p2/3Q3b/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Thought id test it anyway and probably in doing so my biggest mistake of the game...here he offers his bishop on h5 when i glanced at it I had the mindset of (if I capture that I lose my horse which I wanted to use for this move so I left it. Not realising it checks the Black King and I can move straight back to d5 and still keep the threat is probably one of the things that keeps my rating low....just a result of not looking thoroughly before moving. I saw it before he moved Bf7 and yeah grr haha. 
544,22,10,1Qxf7+,b'r3kbnr/pppq1Qpp/2Np1p2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',After weighing up my options I could not see a plasuible mate from my situation without taking that Bishop my Knight was not in a position to attack and the f6 pawn stops my Black Bishop from being able to help so a little forced i felt this move Qxf7+

546,22,12,Kxf7,b'r4bnr/ppp2kpp/2Np1p2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',After this I did stand a Knight up so the outcome wasnt that bad but mate was alot further away now than the hige threat it stood as before and I was now hoping he made a mistake or two so as not to draw the game out or I could be regretting move 7 later on...
547,22,13,1O-O,b'4rbnr/ppp2kpp/3p1p2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Here i had seen the Rooks placement and I knew there was a fork on d6 but it was going to take planning and a bit of luck with his moves to pull it off...

549,22,15,1Nf5,b'4rbnr/pp3kpp/3p1p2/2p2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',That looks like I'm moving away from capture I find alot of moves for me work well when I am doing things with one move...e.g capturing and developing avoiding capture while developing or making a move he thinks is obvious but has a hidden agenda behind it
550,22,16,1b5,b'4rbnr/p4kpp/3p1p2/1pp2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - b6',"??

Maybe he is setting up b4 threatening the Knight on c3 but that still doesnt seem like the smartest move"

552,22,18,1Nb5,b'4rbnr/p4kpp/3p1p2/1Np2N2/1p2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Again this looks good for me he attacks I 'move out the way' and simply move forwards instead of backwards...I'm liking this now

554,22,20,1Nxe8,b'4N1nr/p3k2p/5pp1/2p5/1p2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',That leaves me 6 points up in material and I have a 3rd plan (this is really the first game where after my first plan fails I materialised another one or two I'm really really happy (with the expcetion of move 7) of how I played this game. Whats important to me is that after my gameplan failed due to a mistake of mine I was able to make the best of it and pull back before attacking again. The 3rd plan will come to light on move 21 or 22 but I told my opponent I wanted to annotate this game so he may be reading this hehe...
555,22,21,f5,b'4k2r/p3n2p/6p1/2p1Pp2/1p3B2/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',He saw that plan (wasnt a great one lol)
556,22,22,Rf8,b'4kr2/p3n2p/6p1/2p1Pp2/1p3BP1/8/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',In my opinion the game was already over but Black put up a good fight
557,22,23,Nd5,b'4k3/p6p/6p1/2pnPr2/1p2RB2/8/PPP2P1P/R5K1 w - -',This position I analysed for quite a while I know all too well when things get a tad tight if I make a mistake it could all but cost me the game
558,22,24,2Rae1,b'8/p3k3/4P1p1/2pn1r1p/1p2R3/6B1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Black running out of both room and time...

560,22,26,3h4,b'8/p1n1k3/4P3/2p1R1pp/1p5P/6B1/PPP2P2/6K1 b - h3',Ne4 was maybe an option? Yes White would have played hxg5 most likely but Ne4 was still better in my opinion
561,22,27,Nxe6,b'8/p7/3kn3/2p1R2p/1p6/6B1/PPP2P2/6K1 w - -',Also a good time to make the capture. Not much Black can do but at least he isn't resigning. I find it difficult to develop my endgame more than any part of my game because so many resign when in a losing position. Im focusing on 'winning a won game' in the next month or so...
562,22,28,Nf5,b'8/p7/6R1/1kp2n2/1p3P2/6B1/PPP5/6K1 w - -',Perhaps Black can make something out of White's poor pawn structure with his Knight and King? Give his pawns a chance? Through analysis I knew they wouldnt get anywhere decent enough in time
563,22,29,Nxe7,b'8/4nP2/p7/1kp5/1p6/8/PP6/4B1K1 w - -',Allowed the exchange obviously the pawn was about to reach f8 it was no matter now..
564,22,30,Na5,b'5Q2/8/p7/nkp5/1p6/1P6/P7/4B1K1 w - -',"Here White resigned and fairly so 5 moves away from mate as far as I could see and Black wasnt in the game for most of the Match...

The advance claims extra territory and reduces the options for Black's kingside knight but doesn't help White's development and exacerbates the vulnerability of White's pawn on d4.  the game is already double-edged.

However the line that he chooses suffers from lack of counter attacking chances and is only good for a draw. This can be problematic for locvim because closed positions are tougher to play. In game we talked about the importance of patience as black to wait for white to over commit. However it is black who get impatient a tries to make something happen. 

In this game Locvim did several things right:
1. He keep the centre closed for as long as possible
2. he exchanged his pieces for white's major attacking pieces Thus neutralizing white's ablility to mount an attack. 

In the end Locvim could ahve easily earned a draw had he kept following #2"

the trade off this move is that Black will have difficulty mounting an counter attack and developing the LSB. The major criticism of the french is that he can have difficulty developing the LSB playing ...Nd7 makes that task of developing the bishop twice as hard.

Las negras con d5 intentan sacar del esquema a las blancas con un golpe tampoco muy usual en este momento al mismo tiempo que se intenta explorar la diagonal por la cual las blancas quieren lograr ventaja  más habitual para las negras aqui es 7...h5 7.....Cxd4  7....0-0
