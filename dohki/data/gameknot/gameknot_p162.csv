0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I love to play d5 after d4 because I learnt this black opening defence from FM Charles Galofre via a video on chess.com He calls it a universal system 
1,0,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',After Playing d5 my next move is usually c6 or gKnight to f6 or cBishop to f5 what your trying to achieve with black is a triangle on the light squares once the c Bishop is outside the pawn chain then shut the door with pawn to e6 making your triangle complete if your allowed to do so I believe this opening defense for black is some sort of slav or semi slav I have adapted it even further from learning it originally by altering it after several times being attacked on b7 or a7 got a little fed up so I bought a video on slavs and called it a6 
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My next move is as normal c6

4,0,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',ionescu played Nc3 so I will play Nf6 covering the square e4 and also d5 also developing my pieces
5,0,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I have thought about the move and played my c bishop outside the pawn chain my next move will be as I was going to move Nf6
6,0,6,h3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',My opponent just played 4. h3 I am not sure why for definite he played h3 I think he is trying to stop my bishop going onto g4 threatening the knight defender on f3
7,0,7,h6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This my 4. h6 is to protect the bishop if attacked by the Knight on h4 from Nf3I can hide the bishop I call it a car park just put it here on h7 if attacked and is protected by Rook on h8
8,0,8,g4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3p1b2/3P2P1/2N2N1P/PPP1PP2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq g3',Here my opponent has attacked my bishop on f5 so I will park it in the car park on h7

11,0,11,Bg2,b'r3kbnr/pp1qpppb/2p4p/3p4/3P2P1/2N4P/PPP1PPB1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Here he plays Bishop to g2 I will castle long here giving me a rook behind my Queen on d8 giving me some power on the d file
12,0,12,e4,b'2kr1bnr/pp1qpppb/2p4p/3p4/3PP1P1/2N4P/PPP2PB1/R1BQK2R b KQ e3',He now played 9. e4 attacking my pawn on d5 To back up my d5 pawn I can either close the door with pawn to e6 or My knight to f6 which also attacks e4 and also protects d5 remembering my bishop on h7 which is aiming at e4 so he has 3 attackers attacking my pawn on d5 but I will have 4 protecters so I will win that d5 argument.
13,0,13,1e5,b'2kr1b1r/pp1qpppb/2p2n1p/3pP3/3P2P1/2N4P/PPP2PB1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',He walks on by d5 pawn to e5 my problem here is I have my Queen on d7 where I should have put my Knight on d7 but with the queen on d7 I dont want to develop my knight onto g8 or e8 So I am forced to move my knight onto e4 which is being attacked by his bishop on g2 and his knight on c3 I have only 2 protecting the knight so more of an even argument.

21,0,21,1f3,b'2kr1b1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3qP3/3Pp1P1/5P1P/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',He now decides to attack me again with his pawn to f3 which attacks my pawn on  e4 several things always go through my mind which I learnt too take is a mistake So I thought for now I would close the door a bit late but better late than never with my e6 pawn which also helps my development of my bishop on f8 can see daylight

29,0,29,1Qxf7,b'2kr1b1r/pp3Qp1/2p1p2p/4q3/6P1/4B2P/PPP5/R4RK1 b - -',He took the pawn on f7 Now it's up to me I have the option of checking his king on g3 or e3 which I also can take his bishop looks good I don't see his queen on f7 as much of a danger even though he has the rook on f1 as back up..
30,0,30,1Qxe3+,b'2kr1b1r/pp3Qp1/2p1p2p/8/6P1/4q2P/PPP5/R4RK1 w - -',I thought I might as well check him and also take his bishop on e3 which was quite good I thought I am now +4 I think he has miss calculated his queen taking my pawn on f7 I hope unless he is more of a threat than I first thought but don't think so.. anyway I am a pawn up and a bishop

40,0,40,2Bc5+,b'2kr3r/Qp4p1/2p1p2p/2b3q1/6P1/8/PPP5/4RRK1 w - -',He fell for that one checked his king and threatening his queen which in turn is covered by my queen on level 5 if he moves his king out of check I can then take his queen or if he takes my bishop I can then take his queen on c5 with check again He retires best thing to do I think 
41,1,0,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/1bP5/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',A blunder!  I am not too familiar with Queen-side openings and didn't take the effort to carefully analyze the position before making what seemed to me like a plausible move.
42,1,1,Qxb4,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/3Pp3/1QP5/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Resigning at this point was very tempting.  After all I was down a bishop after only 7 moves had nothing to compensate for it and that too against a player whose rating was around 100 points higher than mine.

127,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I think it was GM Bent Larsen who once stated that sometimes chess is pure mathematics sometimes art and sometimes a pure boxing match. This Kings Indian really had the boxing aspect!
128,3,1,Ne7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This has been played thousands of times but now White has to decide between main lines like: Ne1 Nd2 a4 or b4. More or less it all comes to the same: White attacks on the Q-side Black on the K-side. The battle is on.
129,3,2,b6,b'r1bq1rk1/2pnn1bp/1p1p4/p2Pp1p1/P1P1Pp2/2NN1P2/1P2BBPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black tries to control the important square c5 for as long as possible but I must admit Bg7 looks awful. Nevertheless it is still well known theory.
130,3,3,Nf6,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1n1bp/1p1p1n2/3Pp1p1/PNP1Pp2/2N2P2/4BBPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',"Only chance for Black is to keep the pawns rolling on the K-side. In poker they call it ""all in!""."
131,3,4,Rf7,b'r1bq2k1/2p2rbp/1p1p1nn1/3Pp1p1/P1P1Pp2/2NN1P2/4B1PP/R2QBRK1 w - -',I prefer this to the immediate 18. - h5 idea. For the time being the Rook defends the weak pawn on c7 and in the future it can swing over to g7 or h7.
132,3,5,g3,b'2bq2k1/2p2rbp/3p1nn1/BN1Pp3/2P1Pp2/3N1Pp1/4B1PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',I thought this position was fun to look at: The pawn chains! Then I looked at my Bg7 again and didn´t think it was so much fun anymore. But at least it protects the King.
133,3,6,2h3,b'2bq2k1/2p2rbp/3p1nn1/BN1Pp3/2P1Pp2/3N1PpP/4B1P1/3Q1RK1 b - -',I had a long think here. I am about to be crushed on the Q-side and decided for a dubious sac on h3.
134,3,7,2Nf2,b'6k1/2pq1rbp/3p1nn1/BN1Pp3/2P1Pp2/5PpP/4BN2/3Q1RK1 b - -',And a sac in return! Is it necessary? I had expected something like 25. Qd2 and 26. Bd1 to avoid the mate threats but the position is rather unclear. Still I don´t think Black has enough compensation for the Bishop.
135,3,8,Qxh3,b'4n1k1/2p2rbp/3p2n1/BN1Pp3/2P1Pp2/5P1q/2Q1BR2/6K1 w - -',Black is up a pawn in the endgame but how often do you reach an endgame in a Kings Indian?
136,3,9,c6,b'2q1n1k1/5rbp/2pp2n1/1N1Pp3/2P1Pp2/5P2/2Q1B2R/4B1K1 w - -',Rather have a weak d6 pawn than a weak c7 pawn. The Black bishop can always protect the d6 pawn from f8.
137,3,10,Ra7,b'2q1n1k1/r5bp/2pp2n1/3Pp3/2P1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B2R/4B1K1 w - -',Another good reason for playing 18. - Rf7: Suddenly the Rook challenges Whites back rank.
138,3,11,3Bc4+,b'4nbk1/1q5p/6n1/2B1p3/2B1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q3KR/r7 b - -',In my opinion 36. Bf2 is better. With the Bishop pair still on White is still almost equal in spite of a pawn down.
139,3,12,3Rh4,b'4nn1k/1q5p/8/4p3/2B1Pp1R/2N2P2/2Q3K1/r7 b - -',White has played a very good game so far and I guess he saw I mate on g8 in some lines after Rg4 but this blunder looses on the spot. 38. Ne2 Qb4 39. Rh1 is still better for Black but far from decisive.
140,3,13,Ng6,b'4n2k/6qp/6n1/4p3/2B1PpR1/2N2P2/2Q3K1/r7 w - -',With the deadly threat h7-h5 or Nf6 and White will have to give up the exchange.
141,3,14,4Kf2,b'4n2k/6qp/6n1/4p3/2B1PpR1/2N2P2/2Q2K2/r7 b - -',Last chance was 40. Nd1 h5 41. Rxg6 Qxg6 with a lost endgame.
142,3,15,4Qa7+,b'4n2k/q6p/6n1/4p3/2B1PpR1/2N2P2/2Q2K2/r7 w - -',With a forced mate in maximum 10 moves.  No the Kings Indian is not for players with bad nerves!
143,4,0,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',Setting up the Grandprix Attack.  A more solid positional move is g3 setting up a Closed Sicilian.
144,4,1,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Preparing to fianchetto.
145,4,2,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is one of the two longest diagonals on the board.  The bishop can be used effectively here but with proper play I can cancel out this advantage for black.
146,4,3,Bb5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Another option is Bc4 but I like this less because black has the option of playing e6 limiting the bishop's usefulness.  Bb5 is more proactive aiming for an exchange of minor pieces as the white bishop will not be very helpful in white's coming attack.
147,4,4,a6,b'r2qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p1np2p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This forces the exchange right away.
148,4,5,Qe1,b'r2qk1nr/1p2ppbp/p1bp2p1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',The queen can now go for h5 or support a central advance.
149,4,6,1Bd2,b'r2qk2r/1p2ppbp/p1bp1np1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R3QRK1 b kq -',"Probably a weak move now that I think about it.  White essentially wastes a move.

150,4,7,1Qh4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1bp1np1/2p5/4PP1Q/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Aims at the potential weak spot on h6.
151,4,8,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppbp/p1bp1np1/2p5/4PP1Q/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Helps black to connect the rooks.  Still it seems a little passive in light of the coming attack.
152,4,9,1e5,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppbp/p1bp1np1/2p1P3/5P1Q/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Now if black chooses to exchange pawns the f6 knight will be forced away allowing a maelstorm of lightning quick attacks on the kingside.
153,4,10,1f5,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppbp/p1bp2p1/2pnPP2/7Q/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R4RK1 b - -',This allows the bishop into the game aiming for h6.  Also there are some threats with f6 that need to be dealt with.  This position is difficult for black to defend.
154,4,11,1Bxc3,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppbp/p1bp2p1/2p1PP2/7Q/2BP1N2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Though this takes away the potential move to h6 it backs up the f6 shove.
155,4,12,d5,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppbp/p5p1/2ppPP2/7Q/2BP1R2/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',This move comes too late.
156,4,13,1f6,b'r4rk1/1pq1ppb1/p4Ppp/2ppP3/7Q/2BP3R/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Now black has to lose his bishop or lose to a mating attack.
157,4,14,h5,b'r4rk1/1pq2pb1/p4Pp1/2pp3p/7Q/2BP3R/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Or 18...Bh8 19.Qxh6 with mate thereafter.
158,4,15,2Bf6,b'r3r1k1/1pq2pP1/p4Bp1/2pp3p/7Q/3P3R/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Prevents black from cutting off the bishop's diagonal with d4.
159,4,16,2Qg5,b'4r1k1/1pq2pP1/p3rBp1/2pp2Qp/8/3P3R/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',Black resigned.  The threat of Qh6 and then mate is unstoppable.
160,5,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Sometimes in chess you just get hit by a steam engine without really knowing what happened. Where did you go wrong? Where could you do better? I am still puzzled by this game - and very impressed about the way my opponent played it.
161,5,1,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"The Bogo Indian instead of the ""normal"" Queens Indian. I never had much respect for it but now I do have!"
162,5,2,Nbd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Played to avoid the exchange of Bishops on d2. Black can even play his Bishop back to e7 and my Bishop looks a bit silly on d2.
163,5,3,Qxd2,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P1QPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Good or bad? Black will gain a tempo when he plays Ne4 but this is all well known theory and White still has a good center and chances on the Q-side.
164,5,4,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P3PN2/1P1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',As Black I would never dream of Bxf3 to destroy the White pawn structure. The Bishop on b7 is too good for that.
165,5,5,Nbd7,b'r4rk1/pbpnqppp/1p1ppn2/8/1PPP4/P3PN2/3QBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"Blacks position starts to look like a ""Hedgehodge"" without the Bishop on e7. A very solid choice."
166,5,6,f5,b'r4rk1/pbpnq1pp/1p1pp3/5p2/1PPPn3/P3PN2/1BQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - f6',And now we have something like a Dutch or Nimzo Indian. The Knight on e4 is very strong but still I think the position is in dynamic balance.
167,5,7,a5,b'r4rk1/1bp1q1pp/1p1ppn2/pP3p2/P1PPn3/4PN2/1BQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - a6',Very strong! My initiative on the Q-side is dead and gone - now Black can start to work on the K-side. Playing bxa6 would just create more weaknesses.
168,5,8,1Bf3,b'r4rk1/1bp1q1pp/1p1pp3/pP3p2/P1PPn1n1/4PB2/1BQ2PPP/R3NRK1 b - -',Of course pawn f3 is not possible because of the fork after Nxe3.
169,5,9,1h3,b'r4rk1/1bp3pp/1p1pp3/pP3p2/P1PPn1nq/4PB1P/1BQ2PP1/R3NRK1 b - -',Only move - but another weakness on Whites K-side.
170,5,10,e5,b'4rrk1/1bp4p/1p1p1n2/pP1Pppp1/P1P1n2q/3NPB1P/1BQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',I was about to resign around here. Just compare the Black Knight on e4 with the White Bishop on b2! Blacks Bishop on b7 can always get into play via c8 to comparison.
171,5,11,Nxg4,b'4rrk1/1bp4p/1p1p4/pP1Pppn1/P1P3nq/4P3/1BQ1BPP1/2NR1RK1 w - -',Computer analysis afterwards showed -4.40 for White in this position. My gut feeling told me to tip over the King and pay respect for the very good play by my opponent. White can just wait for something like Rf6-Rh6 mate or loose material with a depressing endgame.
172,6,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',King's gambit that gives a strong and open game for white.

276,9,35,2Bd4,b'3r2k1/pb5p/6q1/2p5/2PbpP2/PPN5/R3NnBP/4QK2 w - -',"? I thought this move was very strong since I can now threaten ...Ng4 and ...Ne3ch to devastating effect (30. h3 runs into Nxh3!) and keeping my knight on f2 kept the enemy queen off g3 and if white took it I would now have a pair of advanced passed ""hanging pawns"" lurching at the white position so I thought I had a won position either way.  Junior tells me with his usual pitiless manner that I in fact threw away my advantage with this move and I should have played 29. ...Ng4 immediately with 30. ...Rd3 to follow with a tight noose around the position.

Now with the previous losing variation still fresh in my mind and the diseased blood of rats Nosferatu has been forced to eat lying like lysol in his belly I started to hallucinate in despondency and made my worst blunder of the game.  I resigned.  All I could see was an even worse position awaiting me related to the previous 31. ...e3 variation except after the queen-trade a bishop pinned behind the e-pawn and pawns also helpless to be slaughtered.  It turned out this position is completely different.  Contrasted against the superficially similar but inferior 31. ...e3 32. Qg3 Qxg3 33. hxg3 Bxg2ch 34. Rxf2 cxd3 here the synergy of my pieces perfectly aligns to keep the white king off the d-file: 32. ...Qxg3 33. hxg3 Rd1ch 34. Ke2 Rc1!! White is helpless to meet ...c2 and a loss of material i.e.: 35. b4 c2 (threateneing ...Rd1ch) 26. Kd2 Rg1! and white must lose his bishop (and the g-pawn behind it) or else the c-pawn promotes.  A bitter rodent pill for Nosferatu to swallow as he slinks back to his lair awaiting the next opportunity to invade the Kingdom of Banora and this sortie enters the dubious history of chess games where the loser resigned the game in a won position.  The lesson of this game?  Never sink so low in life that you must feed on rats for sustenance in the endgame.

Just to let you know that I failed to get my first ever Expert Victory - by 90 rating points!  I had to settle for only my second ever victory against 1900+ oppo. in a non-timeout game.  With the black pieces I managed a High Draw against him.  Matt gave me a hard game from the Opening to Middlegame but in the latter part a strong move from Glenda forced an exchange of queens that led to my advantage in the endgame in which I was a piece for a pawn up.  Gameknot analysis of this game is provided as follows:-

I now exploit the pin on the weak d5 pawn to either win another pawn making me a full piece up or to force an exchange of rooks giving me a won endgame.  My a pawn and Fou Lenoir can hold fast on the queenside.  If the BK tries to make use of the queenside pawn majority by moving towards the queenside pawns then Henry will move towards the black kingside p(r)awns for a fine supper later on - he fancies prawn vindaloo tonight.  If Henry eats those pawns then my kingside pawns will march on to Glendadom.  My opponent saw all this and decided to wave the white flag to end a lovely evening for me.  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

I seem to be following one bad game with one good game and vice versa!  I lost a game to a 1900+ player called Paolo playing white in the Traxler and dropped 6 rating points.  Luckily I got them back plus a little more in this game when as with Pawnstar the e column proved a death trap to the white king and yet again Glenda was the instigator.

Right now in the middle of a Big Freeze we are all getting ready for Christmas.  Well here is a little winter-warmer for you.  This is now Expert Draw No. 12 and if Dave my opponent had just 17 points more on his rating it would have been my third Master Draw.  Still I am pleased with the result as I got canned by Dave with the black pieces.  So how did all this come about?  Well read on.  Gameknot analysis is provided with the following link:http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14973101&rnd=0.09016686302708665"

735,33,2,Nd4,b'r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/5n2/3Pp3/2Bn4/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w q -',8. ...... Nd4 - the black minor pieces start swarming in and it will not be long before they will be joined by the Wicked Witch of the West!
736,33,3,1Nf7,b'r1b1k3/ppp2Npp/3q1n2/4p3/2Bn4/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q -',10. Nf7 - my knight makes a bid for freedom!
737,33,4,1c3,b'r1b1k3/ppp3pp/5n2/4q3/2Bn4/2P5/PP1P1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q -',12. c3 - tries to chase away the knight but now Dave develops his lsb in order to menace Glenda on d1.
738,33,5,1cxd4,b'r3k3/ppp3pp/5n2/4q3/2BP2b1/8/PP1P1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q -',13. cxd4 - I get rid of that pesky knight and menace the Wicked Witch at the same time.  With a 6 point deficit in material Dave is quite correct in avoiding the exchange of queens!
739,33,6,Kf8,b'r4k2/ppp3pp/5n2/8/Q1Bq2b1/8/PP1P1bPP/RNB2K1R w - -',14. ..... Kf8 - was expecting a move like Bd7 here but then black likes to keep the pressure on Henry.
740,33,7,1Bb5,b'r4k2/ppp3pp/5n2/1B6/Q2q2b1/8/PP1P1bPP/RNB2K1R b - -',15. Bb5 - Fou Leblanc moves to try and stop Re8 and offers another exchange of queens.  Black could keep the Witch on the g1-a7 diagonal but Glenda can get in a nice nuisance check on the a3-f8 diagonal.  Black moves his queen onto the e column threatening Qe1# but Henry decided to rid himself of black's dsb.
741,33,8,1Ke1,b'r4k2/ppp3pp/5n2/1B3q2/Q5b1/8/PP1P2PP/RNB1K2R b - -',17. Ke1 - If it were not for the fact that the Wicked Witch of the West can check Henry ad infinitum on the e and f files I would be looking forward to my first ever Expert Victory in a non-timed out game with an 8 point material advantage.  However Dave does have Ye Olde Perpetualle up his sleeve so I offered him a draw and he accepted.  Gameknot Analysis seemed to back up my decision.

893,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A short game this but I think it demonstrates the advantage of early pressure at a lower-middling level of play on the mental side.
894,36,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',An opening with which I am unfamiliar though I plan to research it more in future as I'm getting a little bored of 1. e4 e5.
895,36,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Not having dealt with this opening before I elect to play this rather than my usual Nc3 looking to restrict the early pawn movement.
896,36,3,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Looking back I feel I could have played Nf6 instead and considered pushing my pawn forwards. Maybe next time.
897,36,4,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I never like this kind of play early. While you should never let your pawns be isolated this kind of play is too safe and restricts your own options.

I can see the objective here push the Queen around without allowing a safe retreat but this move ignores my advanced knight. Ng4 leading to Nge5 would have caused real trouble. Instead Black will come out behind by a bishop.
902,36,9,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
903,36,10,Rf8,b'r2qkr2/pp2bpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQq -',Preventing Qxf7. I think Kd7 may have served better here the mobility of the King should not be forgotten.

Any immediate attempt to continue pressure on the king risks turning successful early pressure into an all-in attack which could easily fail.

912,36,19,1Qg4,b'2kr3r/pp2bQ2/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P1q1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? The final blunder. I presume my opponent was looking to threaten my king with rook and Queen but even ignoring the fork at e6 this effort would be foiled by h3 forcing Black to spend more time extricating his Queen and allowing Qxe7 to increase my lead yet further. Kb8 or Qe8 would have forced me to accept an even exchange or to retreat and try a new angle.
913,36,20,1Be6+,b'2kr3r/pp2bQ2/3pB3/2p1p3/4P1q1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',"Black resigns. While this game was hardly a masterpiece of skill I hope any newer players can see the pitfalls of overreaching and underanalysing which it demonstrates. In particular consider the possible results of 5. ... Ng4 which would have led to a Black advantage and a far longer game and the truly fatal blunder of 7. ... Be7 which turned a lost exchange into a lost game.

The more bull-headed players (or those wishing to test the long-term implications of the carnage amongst Black's pawns) might also consider the ramifications of 14. ... Qe8 or Kb8 as an object lesson in the strength of pawns as the game rolls on but I imagine most of you who examine these annotations are well aware of that!"
914,37,0,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',No I am not copying her moves. I am prodding her to see if I can achieve an imbalanced position.
915,37,1,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The only way to keep the opening normal. Alternatives include 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Nxe5+ or 3. Nxe5. Castling consolidates the position and gives a cue that my opponent prefers development over deep calculations for an imbalanced position in the opening. Maybe that is reading too much into my opponent.
916,37,2,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A somewhat passive response even though the bishop must be freed. Perhaps this also is reading too much into the developing position.
917,37,3,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Leaving a hole on b7.
