102,3,2,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2PB4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',In this opening if Black takes on d4 it is preferable for White to take with his e pawn. Why? There are actually two reasons for this. First it allows the dark-squared bishop to move out more easily. Second the c3 pawn is guarding the b4 square which is an excellent location for Black's knight. However if Black has a bishop on d6 White has to be careful to not let his f pawn fall into the bishop's clutches! Considering it is not the case I retake with my e pawn.
103,3,3,1Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3pN3/3P1P2/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Both sides develops their pieces.

105,3,5,1fxe5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2n1pn2/3pP3/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The resulting position advantages Whte.His pieces are aiming at the kingside whilst Black's piece are stuck on the queenside. As a result Black will have trouble coordinating the defence of her king.
106,3,6,1O-O,b'r1b1nrk1/ppq2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',! I take the time to allow my pieces to quickly come into the attack later.
107,3,7,1f6,b'r1b1nrk1/ppq3pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black understandably tries to break out of the lock.
108,3,8,1Qh5,b'r1b1nrk1/ppq3pp/2n1pp2/3pP2Q/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1B2RK1 b - -',Threatening mate via 14.Bxh7+ Kh8 15.Bg6+ Kg8 16.Qh7#
109,3,9,1f5,b'r1b1nrk1/ppq3pp/2n1p3/3pPp1Q/3P4/2PB2P1/PP1N3P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black blocks the b1-h7 diagonal blunting my bishop's scope. On a side note if I had played 12.Qh5 (instead of 12.0-0) black would have played 12...f5 skipping the f6 square and reaching this position except with an uncastled White King.
110,3,10,Qf7,b'r1b1nrk1/pp3qpp/2n1p3/3pPp1Q/3P4/2PB1NP1/PP5P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black offers an exchage of queen.
111,3,11,1Qh4,b'r1b1nrk1/pp3qpp/2n1p3/3pPp2/3P3Q/2PB1NP1/PP5P/R1B2RK1 b - -',Which I refuse. Trading pieces here would help Black more than me.
112,3,12,1Qg6,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4pp/2n1p1q1/3pPp2/3P3Q/2PB1NP1/PP5P/R1B2RK1 w - -',I'm not sure of what this move accomplishes. It pins her own f pawn as well.
113,3,13,1h3,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4pp/2n1p1q1/3pPp2/3P3Q/2PB1NPP/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',I prepare a g3-g4 pawn push.
114,3,14,1h5,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4p1/2n1p1q1/3pPp1p/3P3Q/2PB1NPP/PP6/R1B2RK1 w - h6',? Black tries to prevent the g4 pawn push but by doing so...
115,3,15,1Ng5,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4p1/2n1p1q1/3pPpNp/3P3Q/2PB2PP/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',! It creates a powerful outpost for my knight on g5. And...
116,3,16,1Be2,b'r1b1nrk1/pp2n1p1/4p1q1/3pPpNp/3P3Q/2P3PP/PP2B3/R1B2RK1 b - -',Her h pawn is lost. There is no way to properly protect it.
117,3,17,1Bxh5,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4p1/2n1p1q1/3pPpNB/3P3Q/2P3PP/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',As a bonus I also hit her queen; which does not have many squares to go!
118,3,18,1Qh6,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4p1/2n1p2q/3pPpNB/3P3Q/2P3PP/PP6/R1B2RK1 w - -',This is the only safe square for the queen which is in the line of fire of my dark-squared bishop once my knight moves. Unfortunately there are no good moves with the knight right now... (20.Nxe6 fails to 20...Qxe6)
119,3,19,2g4,b'r1b1nrk1/pp4p1/2n1p2q/3pPpNB/3P2PQ/2P4P/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',! I add pressure to Black's kingside. However this pins my bishop to my queen so I have to be careful.
120,3,20,2g6,b'r1b1nrk1/pp6/2n1p1pq/3pPpNB/3P2PQ/2P4P/PP6/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Black tries to take advantage of my pinned bishop but it cuts the queen's defence of e6 which allows me the following tactical shot.
121,3,21,2Nxe6,b'r1b1nrk1/pp6/2n1N1pq/3pPp1B/3P2PQ/2P4P/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',! I attack the queen and the rook at the same time. More importantly I took out Black's backbone of her central pawn formation.
122,3,22,Kxf8,b'r1b1nk2/pp5q/2n3p1/3pPp1B/3P2PQ/2P4P/PP6/R1B2RK1 w - -',The downside of this tactic is that I cannot save my bishop.
123,3,23,2f6,b'r1b1nk2/pp5q/2n2P2/3pP2p/3P3Q/2P4P/PP6/R1B2RK1 b - -',In short I traded a knight and bishop for two pawn a rook and a dominating pawn chain from b2 to f6.
124,3,24,Kf7,b'r3n3/pp3k1q/2n1bP2/3pP2p/3P3Q/2P4P/PP5K/R1B2R2 w - -',Both sides try to set free their rooks to control the g file.
125,3,25,2Rg1,b'r3n3/pp3k1q/2n1bP2/3pP2p/3P3Q/2P4P/PP5K/R1B3R1 b - -',However having less undeveloped pieces I gain control of the crucial g file. I also prepare to lift my rook to g5 attacking her h pawn. On a side note Black can't move her e8 knight (and thus freeing her rook) as it prevents a Rg7+ King-Queen fork.
126,3,26,2Bf5,b'r3n3/pp3k1q/2n2P2/3pPb1p/3P3Q/2P4P/PP5K/R1B3R1 w - -',Black prepares the defence of her h pawn via 27...Bg6.
127,3,27,Rg8,b'6r1/ppn2k1q/2n2Pb1/3pP1Rp/3P3Q/2P4P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',Both sides free up their remaining pieces. How to proceed?
128,3,28,3c4,b'6r1/ppn2k1q/2n2Pb1/3pP1Rp/2PP3Q/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 b - -',! The break-through begins!
129,3,29,3Ne6,b'6r1/pp3k1q/2n1nPb1/3pP1Rp/2PP3Q/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',? Understandable but a mistake. Black absolutely had to reduce my central pawn mass.
130,3,30,3cxd5,b'6r1/pp3k1q/2n1nPb1/3PP1Rp/3P3Q/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 b - -',! I sacrifice my rook to get 4 central passed pawns.
131,3,31,3Nxg5,b'6r1/pp3k1q/2n2Pb1/3PP1np/3P3Q/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',Black takes my rook.
132,3,32,3Qxg5,b'6r1/pp3k1q/2n2Pb1/3PP1Qp/3P4/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 b - -',And I retake with my queen retaining the status quo on the kingside. (My queen wasn't doing much on h4 anyway.)
133,3,33,3Nxd4,b'6r1/pp3k1q/5Pb1/3PP1Qp/3n4/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',Black takes my backwards d pawn which saddens me. She also threatens Nf3+ a quadruple fork but she does not have the time in this position.
134,3,34,3e6+,b'6r1/pp3k1q/4PPb1/3P2Qp/3n4/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 b - -',Check!
135,3,35,3Nxe6,b'6r1/pp3k1q/4nPb1/3P2Qp/8/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',Forced. 33...Ke8 would leave the king in a very vulnerable back rank with two mean pawns looking at him.
136,3,36,3dxe6+,b'6r1/pp3k1q/4PPb1/6Qp/8/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 b - -',Check! (Again!)
137,3,37,3Kxe6,b'6r1/pp5q/4kPb1/6Qp/8/7P/PP1B3K/6R1 w - -',Forced for the same reasons as the previous move by Black.
138,3,38,3Re1+,b'6r1/pp5q/4kPb1/6Qp/8/7P/PP1B3K/4R3 b - -',! This forces the win in a nice way.
139,3,39,3Be4,b'6r1/pp5q/4kP2/6Qp/4b3/7P/PP1B3K/4R3 w - -',"Black blocks my rook and attack my queen at the same time.

Other alternatives: 35...Kf7 36.Re7+ 1-0  --- 35...Kd7 36.Re7+ 1-0 --- 35...Kd6 36.Bc5+ Kc6 37.Qc5+ Kd7 38.Re7+ 1-0"
140,3,40,3Rxe4+,b'6r1/pp5q/4kP2/6Qp/4R3/7P/PP1B3K/8 b - -',! The black queen is overloaded. She can't defend both the bishop and rook!
141,3,41,3Qxg8+,b'6Q1/pp6/4kP2/7p/4q3/7P/PP1B3K/8 b - -',The fact that this capture is a check ensures victory for white.
142,3,42,3Kxf6,b'6Q1/pp6/5k2/7p/4q3/7P/PP1B3K/8 w - -',No matter what Black plays she can't avoid the exchange of queens. Variation 1: 37...Kf5 38.Qh7  /// Variation 2: 37...Ke5 38.Qe8+ /// Variation 3: 37...Kd7 38.Qg7+!

148,3,48,4Bf6,b'8/pp6/5B2/7p/7K/7P/PPk5/8 b - -',Black resigns. 1-0
149,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is an opening e4 that I used to use all of the time until TA suggested I start developing the d4 line.
150,4,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Since I'm playing someone who will definetly win why not play something that I can possible learn from or at least explore something different.
151,4,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',looks like he taking a stong hold on the center.
152,4,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I will play somekind of primitive pawn development game.
153,4,4,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',White is playing pawn development also but I feel he is really just opening his forces.
154,4,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/2p5/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',purely reactionary move on my part.

159,4,10,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3p1p/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',purely developmental move

288,8,11,1Rae1,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/4RRK1 b - -',? At this point I make a decision to connect my R's.  And this is something that I am obsessed even more so then I ever was with N fork's for some reason.  However this is my first mistake this time.  That's because of what is about to unfold shortly.
289,8,12,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/2BnP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/4RRK1 w - -',And this is why 11.Rae1?  Right now I want to avoid exchanging N's due to K safety.  In other words this move guarantees a hole and doubled pawns around my K which is the last thing I want because of the fact that it has led to problems in some of my past games.
290,8,13,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/2BnP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',"! Now 11...Nd4 does much more then I just mentioned.  It put my N at risk because after say ...BXP I thought that my only choice QXB?? which just loses the Q after ...NXQ.  But I forgot about my g2 pawn so I could have retaken with that.  So I did miscalculate but I am still marking with an exclamation point.  Why?  Because Jack Stockel said ""You played this?  That's good."""
291,8,14,1Nxf3+,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2NQ1n2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Of course an exchange is still forced which I don't like because I have to with my pawn.  As noted earlier this is about K safety.  But I don't have a choice because if instead 13.Qxf3?? 13...Bxf3 losing the Q for a B.  So because of 11.Rae1? black now has the advantage. 
292,8,15,Qd7,b'r4rk1/1p1qbppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2NQ1P2/PPP2P1P/4RRK1 w - -',At first I did not know why he played this but I figured it out.  Like I mentioned earlier this move completes black's development.
293,8,16,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/1p1qbppp/p2p1n2/3Np1B1/2B1P1b1/3Q1P2/PPP2P1P/4RRK1 b - -',?? At this point I want to exchange N's which I will be successful in doing so but despite what I said earlier this is my first serious mistake.  In fact it is not just a mistake but rather a blunder.  According to my opponent this is actually the losing blunder but the decisive mistake comes later (toward the end).  But why is this a weak move?  Well the reason here is the lesson and the lesson is the moral of this game.  And here's the thing the moral of my games against Jack are more important then the losing move because chess is not about winning or losing but rather learning from your mistakes.  Now normally the moral comes during your costly mistake but that's not the case here.  In this position his f6 N is strong and dangerous and after we exchange by eliminating the Knights I am going to have a lot of problems.  So according to Mr. Stockel best was actually 14.Ne2.  Now normally it doesn't matter if the remains where it is.  You just don't want it to approach the end ranks near the opponents K.  But in a case like this his N is so powerful that you can't allow it to come past the fourth or fifth rank as it will cause problems towards the end even if the N disappears.  Therefore you have to be very careful on how the strong the N is.  In this case I went wrong by recognizing it's strength even though I still have a chance in this game.  Overall I learned about how where and why a N can become a dangerous especially if it is dominant over the other Knight.
294,8,17,Bh3,b'r4rk1/1p1qbppp/p2p4/3Bp1B1/4P3/3Q1P1b/PPP2P1P/4RRK1 w - -',So it appears that he is just wants to win my R or is there more to this then meets the eye?  That remains to be seen.
295,8,18,1Kh1,b'r4rk1/1p1qbppp/p2p4/3Bp1B1/4P3/3Q1P1b/PPP2P1P/4RR1K b - -',Of course I know that he can exchange my f1 R for his LSB and that would be the least of my problems.  What I was worried about and looking at was a possible mate he play something like ...Qg4.  However that was a miscalculation and until I reexamined the position.  What I completely forgot was that I was protected by the doubled and that is going to become very important as we will see very shortly.
296,8,19,1Qg4,b'r4rk1/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Bp1B1/4P1q1/3Q1P1b/PPP2P1P/4RR1K w - -',He decides to move his Q.  At first I thought that this was a serious mistake because I actually wind up taking his DSB but what I think would give me the advantage actually winds up becoming the costly mistake and worst move of the entire game.  
297,8,20,1Bxe7,b'r4rk1/1p2Bppp/p2p4/3Bp3/4P1q1/3Q1P1b/PPP2P1P/4RR1K b - -',?? Because his Q moved I thought that it was feasible to get the bishop.  In addition I thought that this move would win his f8 R for my DSB but that is not the case.  In addition there is way more to this story then meets the eye.  First as mentioned in the Intro this was my first game against this opponent in over two months.  While that might seem irrelevant it plays an essential role on how I play some of my games because I miss out on the threats that I used to not overlook.  So I need to get back in the game.  Second instead of taking the B I could have gotten a free Q with 17.fxg4!! which would have been the best move of this game and that is why those doubled pawns could have played an essential role.  With that in mind it would have been the winning move as opposed to what will become the decisive mistake (actual losing blunder.)  Third but most importantly this move will lead to a mate in one after 17...Qg2#.

It is not only the best but it shows at the same time the fine hand of the master. An ordinary player would have never have thought of giving up the exchange in order to keep the initiative in this position  which was really the only reasonable way in which he could hope to draw the game

I will be noticed that it was Dr.Lasker's forty-fifth move. He had very little time to think and. Furthermore.

772,26,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is very common normally leading to a Najdorf or Dragon variation

775,26,6,dxc5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2P5/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So White takes. If Black takes back White exchanges queens Nf3 goes to e5 hitting Bg4 and f7 and White already has an advantage. So Black avoids this.

Black hasn't castled and White needs the queens on to exploit this. This is a strategic decision. Computers often make strategical errors but rarely tactical errors.
792,26,23,1e5,b'r3kb1r/1p3pp1/p1np1n1p/4p2q/B3P3/2N1B1Q1/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq e6',A poor move by Black. It leaves the d6 pawn backward and on a semi-open file and hence open to attack down the d file to White's rooks and queen. Generally Black has a black squared bishop on f8 so she should be putting her pawns on white squares to give it squares to move to. e7-e6 leaves d6 weak so g6 followed by Bg7 and 0-0 is best to my mind. PMCA likes b7-b5 followed by Ra8-c8 which is a reasonable plan.

828,26,59,3d2,b'8/Q3bpk1/3p2pp/3P4/2B1q3/4r3/PP1p2PP/R4RK1 w - -',"and now Black blunders. Black cannot take the Bc4 immediately as her rook on e3 is attacked by the queen on a7. However by playing Re3-e2 first she threatens mate on g7. Rf1-f2 is then the only defence and then black can take the Bc4 and is back in the game. If white then tries to get the bishop back by exchanging rooks on e2 followed by Qa7xBe7 black wins by Qc4-d4+! and if Kg1-h1 then Qd4-d1+! and White is mated.

The point is that Re3-e2 threatens g2 and apart from giving up the queen with Qa7-f2 White's only other option is Rf1-f2. Then Re2-e1+! is very strong and if Rf2-f1 then Re1xRa1 and if White recaptures the rook she is mated. Please see this puzzle.

853,27,1,Qxg4,b'rnbq1bnr/pppp1k2/7p/8/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',This is the most popular move after Kxf7
854,27,2,Bd6,b'rnbq2nr/pppp1k2/3b3p/8/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Probably ?! as it blocks in the queen's pawn and therefore the LSB. I understand he was trying to defend his pawn but development is crucial in openings like this.
855,27,3,Bc4+,b'rnbq2nr/pppp1k2/3b3p/8/2B1PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',I develop with check

857,27,5,1Qxf6+,b'rnb2knr/pppp4/3b1Q1p/8/2B1Pp1P/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',? Probably a bad idea to trade off queens when I'm behind.

860,27,8,1Kg1,b'r1b2k1r/pppp4/7p/2b5/1n2Pp1P/1BNP4/PPP2nP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',? Allows a discovered check that wins a pawn.
861,27,9,1Nfxd3+,b'r1b2k1r/pppp4/7p/2b5/1n2Pp1P/1BNn4/PPP3P1/R1B2RK1 w - -',I expected that.
862,27,10,Nxc1,b'r1b2k1r/pppp4/7p/2b5/1n2Pp1P/1BN5/PPP3PK/R1n2R2 w - -',?! I would say it was a ? to trade a developed and active piece for an undeveloped one but he's ahead so it isn't that bad as he aims to trade off material. 
863,27,11,1Rfxc1,b'r1b2k1r/pppp4/7p/2b5/1n2Pp1P/1BN5/PPP3PK/R1R5 b - -',?! Probably better is capturing with the other rook as it wasn't doing as much. The reason that I used this one is because I hadn't noticed that the knight and bishop were defending a2 so I didn't want to move my rook that is defending it.
864,27,12,2a3,b'r1b2k1r/pp1p4/2p4p/8/1n2Pp1P/PBN1b3/1PP3PK/R4R2 b - -',I shove the knight away
865,27,13,2Nxc2,b'r1b2k1r/pp1p4/2p4p/8/4Pp1P/PBN1b3/1Pn3PK/R4R2 w - -',?? I guess he didn't notice that my bishop could take the knight.
866,27,14,d6,b'r1b2k1r/pp6/2pp3p/8/4Pp1P/P1N1b3/1PB3PK/R4R2 w - -',Allows his bishop to leave
867,27,15,Ke7,b'r6r/pp2k3/2pp3p/8/4PpbP/P1N1b3/1PB3PK/R4R2 w - -',Here I would put black as ahead. His bishops are wonderful and he's up a pawn.
868,27,16,2b4,b'r6r/pp2k3/2pp3p/8/1P2PpbP/P1N1b3/2B3PK/R4R2 b - b3',I grab some space

871,27,19,3Ra3,b'5rr1/pp2k3/2pp3p/1P2b3/P3P2P/R1N2P1b/2B2R2/7K b - -',I defend the knight

873,27,21,Rg3,b'5r2/pp2k3/2pp3p/1P6/P2bP2P/R1N2Prb/2BR4/7K w - -',?? The sad blunder that loses. I would assume that he plans to double up rooks and get checkmate but I manage to avoid mate and hold onto my extra piece.
874,27,22,Rfxf3,b'8/pp2k3/2pp3p/1P6/P2RP2P/R1N2rrb/2B5/7K w - -',I think doubling rooks on the g file might have been better.
875,27,23,Bf1,b'8/pp2k3/2p4p/1P1P4/P1R4P/R1N2rr1/2B5/5b1K w - -',He looks menacing but I'm not really worried about it as I analyzed and it seems he doesn't really have a way of getting mate.
876,27,24,3dxc6,b'3k4/pp6/2P4p/1P6/P3R2P/R1N2rr1/2B5/5b1K b - -',?? a blunder. Loses my knight.
877,27,25,3cxb7,b'3k4/pP6/7p/1P6/P3R2P/2r5/2B5/5b1K b - -',It's now the endgame. Black has won back his piece but white is still winning.
878,27,26,4Be4,b'1k6/pP2R3/7p/1P6/P3B2P/2r5/8/5b1K b - -',I prepare to play Re8+ and then b8=Q+

881,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Standard e4 opening.
882,28,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Alekhine's Defense.  Really my first mistake I'm familiar with the Sicilian and that is the direction I should have gone.  Alekhine's is a bit of a pet defense I've been trying to add to my repertoire and that's fine but here wasn't the place to practice it. 
883,28,2,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Up to this point I'm still in my comfort zone with this defense.  Until...
884,28,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nf3.  A good response and it put me in a position where I didn't know quite what to do.  I was fully expecting the continuation of 4. c4 my desire to not consult the database is strong but now I'm in deep waters and have no real idea where this is going.  
885,28,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Knowing that the knight generally comes out a move or two later this is the move that basically follows that.  Notice that my rating reflects a memorizing of opening theory rather than an understanding of why these moves are played.  I'm sure a vast improvement would follow if I took the time to understand just a few of these things (if I only had the time).  It would not only aide in openings but also in the movements of the pieces well into middle-game.
886,28,5,Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Defending with a piece less powerful than her Queen (Glenda) which also allows the queen to escape the pin anytime she likes.  This also frees up the knight to move as well which is the direction Joanne takes in her next move.
887,28,6,g6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',My first mistake according to the post-game analysis (PGA) which recommended 5. ... e6.
888,28,7,Bh6,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p2pb/3nP1N1/3P2b1/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A blunder.  This game was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what I was thinking but chances are I got lost in possible variations and forgot the threat at hand to my bishop on g4.
889,28,8,Bxg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p2pb/3nP1N1/3P2B1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',En prise.
890,28,9,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p2pb/3nP1N1/3P2B1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Another mistake... with a heavy force bearing down on the king-side of the board I castled right into it.  I try not to lose sleep over castling into a hot situation I've done it before with success.  Here I didn't look far enough into the position.  Maybe nabbing the knight on g5 was better or maybe developing the queen-side knight was better.  I generally like to have all my intermediate pieces developed before move 10 and there could have been a possibility for a later O-O-O.
