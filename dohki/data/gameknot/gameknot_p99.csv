0,0,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Typically against 1.d4 I'll play either 1...d5 then c6 looking to head into a Slav or possible transition into the Noteboom variation or Nf6 then e6 looking to play either the Nimzo Indian or Benoni depending on White's setup. I noticed that my opponent seemed fond of the London setup so I decided to reply with Nf6 and then a c5-thrust.
1,0,1,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This move is certainly playable but puts little immediate pressure on Black. White is looking to control e4 with the bishop developed out of the pawn triangle with prospects of a kingside attack starting with Ne5.
2,0,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',An immediate e5 is obviously out of the question but I decided to find a way to immediately challenge White over the center. 2...e6 opens the diagonal to develop the bishop to support c5.
3,0,3,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White works on building the strong pawn triangle and opening his LS bishop.
4,0,4,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq c6',And Black thrusts forward from the flank into the center to challenge the development scheme. I've found that immediately challenging fans of the d-pawn systems (London stonewall etc) seems to be quite favourable as you steer them away from familiar waters (while I myself am quite fond of fighting through a semi-open c-file). If White takes the pawn I simply develop the bishop with recapture.
5,0,5,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White completes his triangle.
6,0,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',And Black delays capturing to develop the Queen's Knight to it's natural square behind the c-pawn.
7,0,7,Nd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White continues to develop his Queen's pieces - the Nd2 supports the center and scheme well flexing his muscle over e4/c4.
8,0,8,cxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3p1B2/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',And Black initiates the exchange in accordance with his strategy.
9,0,9,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White could have also captured with the c-pawn but e-pawn takes is probably better for maintaining imbalance and limiting options for Black's LS Bishop's development.
10,0,10,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Butting out the elbow to start gaining space on the queenside with b5 limiting the scope of White's LS Bishop and allowing for the queenside fianchetto of Black's.
11,0,11,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',The most aggressive square available to the bishop - if White can displace Nf6 it becomes quite powerful when supported by a Queen on c2 and may support a future knight hop to e4/c4.
12,0,12,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq b6',Black continues with the intended scheme of development.
13,0,13,Ngf3,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White finally gets the King's Knight into the game - signaling a possible intent to castle kingside.
14,0,14,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black can delay developing the King's Bishop no longer if he wishes to castle with White. Be7 is the only square that makes any sense in this position supporting the knight and central pawns.
15,0,15,1h3,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Perhaps White intended this to support a potential g4 push (which could be met with h3) but if he was afraid of Ng4 this move was misguided as the strong Qc2 would have completed development while still eliminating Ng4 through Bxh7.
16,0,16,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - d6',I debated on this move for some time (also possible was 10...Nd5 11.Bg3 Bb7 12.Qc2 f5 but I wasn't too keen on the idea of playing with a weak d-pawn). d5 I felt was stronger for gaining territory in the center/queenside and controlling the e4/c4 squares and the option of exchanging bishops on d6.
17,0,17,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Another option would have developed the Queen to c2 where it seems to be a bit more influential but White decided to pile up on e5 (that's two pieces and a pawn supporting Ne5).
18,0,18,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Developing the last minor piece. While it is blocked at the moment by the pawn on d5 it does support it and the diagonal may open in the future.
19,0,19,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1pN3/3P1B2/2PB3P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - -',The expected Ne5 exerting strong pressure into Black's territory.
20,0,20,1Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p3pn2/1p1pn3/3P1B2/2PB3P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Black decides to eliminate the offending oppressor. Also possible was 12...Nd7 looking to exchange but the knight is usually well placed to balance offense and defense on f6. The question now is how will White decide to recapture?
21,0,21,1dxe5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p3pn2/1p1pP3/5B2/2PB3P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White naturally recaptures with the pawn which is probably the most pressing option. Recapturing with the Queen doesn't coordinate as well and may have risked having her kicked back recapturing with the bishop leaves it susceptible to being kicked with Nd7 which could then possibly reroute to b6 then to c4.
22,0,22,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbppp/p3p3/1p1pP3/5B2/2PB3P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 w - -',As the offending pawn cannot be immediately eliminated Black must find a new post for the Knight - the c5 square looks good.
23,0,23,1Nf3,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbppp/p3p3/1p1pP3/5B2/2PB1N1P/PP2QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White redeploys the Knight to f3 continuing to push on the Kingside with the option of centralising on d4. Also possible was Nb3 to guard the c5 square (b4 would have left the c-pawn weak).
24,0,24,1Nc5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1pnpP3/5B2/2PB1N1P/PP2QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Pushing forward with a nicely central knight attacking the bishop and eyeing the e4 square.
25,0,25,1Bc2,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1pnpP3/5B2/2P2N1P/PPB1QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White naturally retreats to the only decent square for the bishop.
26,0,26,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/1pnpP3/5B2/2P2N1P/PPB1QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Connecting the rooks and developing the Queen to the semi-open file with the intent to develop the rook behind it and then decide where the Queen best resides (batteried with the rook or perhaps with the bishop). Slight pressure is applied to White's e-pawn tying up a piece. Qc7 was also possible to support pawn pushing on the Queenside.
27,0,27,1Bg3,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/1pnpP3/8/2P2NBP/PPB1QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',I'm not sure what White was planning with this - perhaps looking to exchange on h4 perhaps looking to start unblocking the f-file perhaps looking to entice Black's Ne4 but Nd4 and Rfd1 appear to be stronger candidates.
28,0,28,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/1p1pP3/4n3/2P2NBP/PPB1QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Looking to eliminate the bishop-pair one way or another or have a nicely advanced knight controlling White's camp. The exchange of Bxe4 results in a strong nicely advanced e-pawn.
29,0,29,1Bxe4,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/1p1pP3/4B3/2P2NBP/PP2QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White naturally captures but giving up the bishop pair and allowing the supported d-pawn to harry his camp.
30,0,30,1Nd2,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/1p2P3/4p3/2P3BP/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White's Knight retreats adding another attacker onto Black's e-pawn.
31,0,31,1Qc6,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/4p3/2P3BP/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Which Black defends with a Queen-Bishop battery locking on to the Kingside. To remove it White will have to compromise his pawn structure resulting in an isolate King's pawn.
32,0,32,1f3,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/4p3/2P2PBP/PP1NQ1P1/R4RK1 b - -',White looks to immediately remove the offender (also possible and stronger was 19.Rae1 e3 20.fxe3 Rd8).
33,0,33,2Nxf3,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/R4RK1 b - -',With Knight takes being the strongest option to improve his position. Note that 20.Rxf3 fails to 20...Qb6+ 21.Rf2 Bc5 or 21.Bf2 Bxf3.
34,0,34,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/R4RK1 w - -',Black's next immediate plan is simple - Rooks to the c/d-files to exert their command.
35,0,35,2Rxd8+,b'2rR2k1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/5RK1 b - -',White decides to exchange - usually I leave the rooks facing off to keep the tension high unless I'm looking to exchange off for a draw.
36,0,36,2Rd1,b'3r2k1/1b2bppp/p1q1p3/1p2P3/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/3R2K1 b - -',White continues in his quest to trade pieces off the board - as I have the slightly healthier pawn structure and the bishop pair I'm content to oblige.
37,0,37,h5,b'6k1/1b2bpp1/p1q1p3/1p2P2p/8/2P2NBP/PP4P1/3Q2K1 w - h6',Black begins the push in against White's Kingside - looking to hold back his pawns and displace his pieces to allow the King to enter the fight heading after the e-pawn.
38,0,38,2Qe2,b'6k1/1b2bpp1/p1q1p3/1p2P2p/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/6K1 b - -',White looks to defend the e-pawn further and possibly allow the Queen exchange on e4.
39,0,39,2g5,b'6k1/1b2bp2/p1q1p3/1p2P1pp/8/2P2NBP/PP2Q1P1/6K1 w - g6',Pushing forward again with a defended g-pawn to press in on White.
40,0,40,2Ne1,b'6k1/1b2bp2/p1q1p3/1p2P1pp/8/2P3BP/PP2Q1P1/4N1K1 b - -',White retreats the knight further defending g2. With Black's h4 White will have to cede control over the h2-b8 diagonal with his bishop.
41,0,41,Qe4,b'6k1/1b2bp2/p3p3/1p2P1p1/4q2p/2P4P/PP2QBP1/4N1K1 w - -',Black offers an exchange of Queens which favours his position (The King is not far away from attacking the e-pawn)
42,0,42,2Qxe4,b'6k1/1b2bp2/p3p3/1p2P1p1/4Q2p/2P4P/PP3BP1/4N1K1 b - -',White obliges as Black's Queen on e4 also attacked the e-pawn.
43,0,43,2Bxe4,b'6k1/4bp2/p3p3/1p2P1p1/4b2p/2P4P/PP3BP1/4N1K1 w - -',Queens are off the board and Black's bishop dominates the Knight with no squares where it cannot be attacked.
44,0,44,Kg7,b'8/4bpk1/p3p3/1p2P1p1/4b2p/2P1B2P/PP4P1/4N1K1 w - -',Black gets the King moving to take care of the isolated pawn while White's King is unable to penetrate through to aid in time.
45,0,45,3Kf2,b'8/4bpk1/p3p3/1p2P1p1/4b2p/2P1B2P/PP3KP1/4N3 b - -',And White looks to activate his King.
46,0,46,3g4,b'8/4bp2/p3p1k1/1p2P1p1/4b1Pp/2P1B2P/PP3K2/4N3 b - g3',White is unable to lock in the Kingside pawns due to en passant but was perhaps looking to exchange off. 31.Nf3 Bxf3 32.Kxf3 Kf5 33.Bd4 and Black's bishop can still reposition through d8->c7 to attack the e-pawn.
47,0,47,Bd5,b'8/4bp2/p3p3/1p1bPkp1/3B4/2P3KP/PP6/4N3 w - -',Black's DS bishop reroute is still planned but Bd5 was played to probe and see what weaknesses might be induced on the Queenside pawns to take advantage of in the future.
48,0,48,Be4,b'8/4bp2/p3p3/1p2Pkp1/3Bb3/P1P3KP/1P6/4N3 w - -',Back to dominating the Knight.
49,0,49,Bxf3,b'8/4bp2/p3p3/1p2Pkp1/3B4/P1P2bKP/1P6/8 w - -',With the Knight eliminated it's only a matter of time before e5 falls.
50,0,50,3b3,b'3b4/5p2/p3p3/1p2Pkp1/3B4/PPP2K1P/8/8 b - -',White plays the strong 3-pawns abreast against Black's minority.
51,0,51,3c4,b'8/2b2p2/p3p3/1p2Pkp1/2PB4/PP3K1P/8/8 b - -',And with c4 leading the charge naturally creates a passed pawn.
52,0,52,Bxe5,b'8/5p2/p3p3/4bkp1/2PB4/P4K1P/8/8 w - -',Black has finally gained the 1-pawn advantage with three of his pawns connected and strong in comparisson to White's more fragile though still somewhat dangerous position. 
53,0,53,4Bb6,b'8/5p2/pB2p3/4bkp1/2P5/P4K1P/8/8 b - -',White aims to support the movement of his c-pawn and inhibit Black's a-pawn.
54,0,54,4Bb2,b'8/5p2/pB2p3/5kp1/2P5/P4K1P/1b6/8 w - -',Not just attacking the a-pawn but more to the point to allow e5 and the bishop to come back to d4.
55,0,55,4c5,b'8/5p2/pB2p3/2P2kp1/8/P4K1P/1b6/8 b - -',White naturally advances the potential Queen but leaves it susceptible to a pin/skewer.
56,0,56,4a4,b'8/5p2/pB2p3/2P2kp1/P2b4/5K1P/8/8 b - -',White advances the a-pawn aiming for a5 to alleviate the pin with the threat of double-passers.
57,0,57,Ke6,b'8/5p2/pB2k3/P1P3p1/3bp3/7P/4K3/8 w - -',Blacks central pawn majority will be fine for the moment - it's more important to take care of the threats on the Queenside for the timebeing.
58,0,58,4c6,b'8/5p2/pBP1k3/P5p1/3bp3/7P/4K3/8 b - -',White opens the pin but Black's King is close enough to the action on e6 to single-handedly deal with two unsupported passers. Also possible was 45.Bd8 Bxc5 46.Bxg5 f5 47.h4 Be7.
59,0,59,Kd6,b'8/5p2/pPPk4/6p1/4p3/7P/4K3/8 w - -',Two passed pawns just two steps away each from Queening but alas the Black King owns that part of the board.
60,0,60,4c7,b'8/2P2p2/pP1k4/6p1/4p3/7P/4K3/8 b - -',If 47.b7 Kc7 (to take is a blunder) 48.Ke3 f5 and White King cannot catch pawns on both sides of the board.
61,0,61,4Kd7,b'8/2Pk1p2/pP6/6p1/4p3/7P/4K3/8 w - -',The correct move to take the steam out of White's threats. If 48.c8 then Kxc8 and if 48.b7 Kxc7 and the other pawn falls as well. 
62,0,62,4Ke3,b'8/2Pk1p2/pP6/6p1/4p3/4K2P/8/8 b - -',White realises the passers are impotent at the moment and looks to attack Black's pawn mass.
63,0,63,4f5,b'8/2Pk4/pP6/5pp1/4p3/4K2P/8/8 w - f6',Which is made difficult with f5 as h4/g4/f4/f3/d3 are unavailable to the King.
64,0,64,a5,b'8/2Pk4/1P6/p4pp1/3Kp3/7P/8/8 w - -',And with a5 there are too many potential promotion threats for the King to deal with.
65,0,65,Kxc7,b'8/1Pk5/8/p1K2pp1/8/4p2P/8/8 w - -',And White resigned.
66,1,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',My second game against Joanne who is a very strong player. Our first ended in a draw with me as black. Now I take quite some chances with the King's gambit which often leads to wild but interesting games and which is an opening I love
67,1,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Joanne accepts the gambit (KGA). The key strategy for white now is to develop a fast and effective kingside attack without loss of tempo. White's disadvantage apart from the sacrificed pawn is a weak kingside position. The advantage is fast development of the kingside for the attack.
68,1,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The usual move although 3. Bc4 has also lead to great games
69,1,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3...d6 is the KGA variant that has Bobby Fisher's name. When he introduced it he claimed that it nullified the KGA. Yet Fisher played the KGA as white later on - with quite some success. In my view 3...d6 is a very strong move - in all its simplicity. It opens the path for the LSB (light-squared bishop) protects e5 and does not destroy the kingside fortress
70,1,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4. Bc4 is important in most versions of KGA. It puts pressure on the weak square f7 the typical focus of attack in KGA. The f7 square will be important in this game too
71,1,5,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4....h6 is another good move preparing for a strong black bastion on the king side
72,1,6,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/8/2B1Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq h3',The GK computer claims 5. h4 to be a considerable inaccuracy (see computer analysis) on which I dare to disagree. The suggested alternative 5. d4 would be followed by 5....g5 which I was aiming to prevent. I was also thinking about 5. b3 as an alternative interesting possibility leading to the somewhat atypical fianchetto of white's DSB. I must try that next time.
73,1,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/8/2B1Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Probably the best move by black straightforward development of the kingside attacking e4 and eyeing g4 in a later attack
74,1,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/8/2B1Pp1P/2N2N2/PPPP2P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',6.Nc3 is best here I think. A sound developing move with simultaneous support of e4
75,1,9,d4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p1n1p/8/2BPPp1P/2N2N2/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',7. 0-0 was also possible here
76,1,10,Nh5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPp1P/2N2N2/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Simultaneous support for the threatened f4 and eyeing g4 - strong play by Joanne! 7....Nxe4 was also possible followed by 8. Nxe4 d5 9. Bxf4 dxc4 10. d5
77,1,11,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPp1P/2N2N2/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',8. Ne2 was also all right putting more pressure on f4 since e4 was no longer attacked and moving more arsenal to the kingside. The more support for an attack the better the chances. The downside is of course that the attacker must not lose tempo!
78,1,12,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPpbP/2N2N2/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black's strong play continues - attack is the best defense! g5 was also possible (but will come next)
79,1,13,Qd3,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPpbP/2NQ1N2/PPP3P1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Removes the pin on the queen by the bishop but nevertheless keeps the queen in play. Nd2 and Nd5 were other possibilities worth exploring separately
80,1,14,g5,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3p3p/6pn/2BPPpbP/2NQ1N2/PPP3P1/R1B2RK1 w kq g6',This completes black's pawn organisation; very strong! However note that behind that fence of pawns the black king is vulnerable. White's LSB has eyed f7 for some time now. In retrospect 9.....0-0 might have been better.
81,1,15,1Nh2,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3p3p/6pn/2BPPpbP/2NQ4/PPP3PN/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Nh2 is a strong move chasing off the LSB opening up the f column for the rook as well as a path for the white queen towards the side of attack. Moves with multiple good purposes of both attack and defense are always the best ones! It is therefore worth the while to take time to find them.
82,1,16,1Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbp2/3p3p/6pn/2BPPp1P/2NQ4/PPP3PN/R1B2RK1 w kq -',10...Bd7 is not bad but I think Be6 had been better with the aim to exchange away the dangerous white LSB at c4
83,1,17,1Qf3,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbp2/3p3p/6pn/2BPPp1P/2N2Q2/PPP3PN/R1B2RK1 b kq -',"11. Qf3 is again multipurpose: it brings the Q into ""play"" attacks the knight at h5 which is also a good attacking square (later) for the white Q"
84,1,18,1Ng3,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbp2/3p3p/6p1/2BPPp1P/2N2Qn1/PPP3PN/R1B2RK1 w kq -',"11.....Ng3 looks good at first glance. Yet it loses the game for black. I think the GK computer's verdict of ""inaccuracy"" is a considerable underestimate. This is where the vulnerable f7 square takes effect. 12. Bxf7 Kxf7 forces the black king to the f column so that 13. Qxf3 cannot be countered by fxQ "

As paradoxical as it may sound I think 12......Kf8 is the second significant mistake by black which ascertains defeat. Strangely enough the GK computer has no objection against this move. After 12....Kf7 13. Qxg3; Qg8 14. Nd5 black's position is indeed bad but in my opinion a lot better than after 12....Kf8.

A nice fighting game that emphasises the delicate balance of strengths between white and black in the KGA opening. Black played the opening extremely well but underestimated the threat at f7 in a bold try to counter-attack. The balance is such that even a single small error tips the advantage to one side or the other. In my view this is the charm of the KGA - never dull!"

124,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Like me Erica opens with the King's Pawn Opening.
125,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And black responds with the King's Pawn Game.  Now if I were black I would have responded with the Sicilian Defense because of what happens during the next two moves..
126,4,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This is her first mistake and what I am talking about.  Knights are supposed to be developed before bishops because you know where the N is supposed to go but not the B.  Normally that is almost irrelevant but this is going to make a huge difference later on as we will see.  The reason for 1...c5 as opposed to 1...e5 is because if 2.Bc4 2...e6 to cut the bishops diagonal.  BTW I am not saying this because of the Game DB at all.  It is actually because I reviewed this with Jack Stockel when an opponent plays 2.Bc4 in hopes of SM.  At first Mr. Stockel advised me to immediately respond by bringing the Knight out (with 2...Nf6).  Then I talked to him about a different version of the French Defense and he studied the positions.  A couple of minutes later he told me that 2...e6 is even better.
127,4,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Interestingly enough black decides to develop.  As mentioned on my last note it would have been better to develop with the other Knight.  To me however that is totally irrelevant.  Why?  At his level all that matters is development and that is what he's doing.  As we will see momentarily he will bring the other Knight out momentarily.
128,4,4,Qf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',"? This is her first big mistake.  In this position she is attempting the f7 tactic.  In a different game Erika lost because her opponent mated her with the Four Move Trick.  In some cases you want to use other peoples strategies and tactics to defeat them.  For example I used easy19's tactics and strategies to mate a different opponent after getting ""Freddied"" as jstevens1 calls it as illustrated by Joann and I.  However in this case you don't want to use people's strategies or tactics for obvious threats like SM.  @goldmedal20: There is problem with this move for two reasons.  First this threat is straightforward and it is easy for almost anyone to see this threat even novices.  Having said that I have the same question for you that the reaper1 asked me in previous annotations.  Did you think that your opponent would allow this mate in one?  Second your Queen is out way too early.  Even I do not bring it out by my third move.  Why?  Because you waste time by bringing this piece out while your opponent continues to develop his minor pieces.  Later on that Queen will get attacked as you will see momentarily.  So in this case trying to follow your opponents tactics and strategies for this type of mate is ""the evil way to do things"" as one of my coworkers would say.  Because of what I mentioned it is important to develop and follow basic principles (General Opening Principles) before going for obvious tricks like this.  BTW principles are not absolute rules but they are general guidelines to help you develop.  However the most important principle is do not bring your Queen out before your other pieces have been developed; and that should be followed except for extenuating circumstances.  In most cases however there's no compensation for bringing the Queen out early.  In addition this is an example of unsound aggression.  What is unsound aggression?  Unsound aggression=aggression that does not harm your opponents position.  It is also aggression that does not acheive anything because you look for the most straightforward threats so it is easily spottable.  More often then not unsound aggression actually backfires and harms your position and that is going to happen later on."
129,4,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Since ...e5 this is his best response to the threat.  In addition he is developing while white just wasted time by bringing her Queen out early as mentioned in her last move.
130,4,6,g4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P1P1/5Q2/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq g3',I do not know she moved there but this is another mistake for two reasons.  First she made it unsafe to castle Kingside.  Most importantly however is the fact that this move will allow Thom to attack her Queen.  Therefore best was 4.Ne2 as it develops and keeps her Queen protected.  Now black is much more developed then white as a result.
131,4,7,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BnP1P1/5Q2/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',"Therefore black is continuing to punish white for ""Poor Opening Play"" as cdeburca calls it."
132,4,8,g5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p1P1/2BnP3/5Q2/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',?? Unaware of what's going on white decides to attack his Knight.  However she overlooks that her Queen is under attack.  Therefore this is her loosing blunder as she looses her Queen and a pawn for his d4 Knight after 5...Nxf3+.  @goldmedal20: Bringing your Queen out early is what ultimately led to this problem because of what I mentioned earlier.  
133,4,9,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p1P1/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RK1 b kq -',? Now she decides to castle.  Normally castling is solid but this time there is a problem with that.  g5 was played before this move.  So it's too little too late.  Why?  This move exacerbates the position as it exposes her King.  Instead white's focus should be to castle Queenside as opposed to Kingside.  The only problem is that her Queenside is completely undeveloped.  In other words she did not get her other pieces out.  @goldmedal20: In general you want to get your pieces out ASAP and that is why there are General Opening Principles.  What are General Opening Principles?  Basically they are a set of guidelines to help you develop and get your pieces out quickly.
134,4,10,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1P1/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RK1 w kq d6',! At first glance this move looks dubious.  In reality however it is anything but a waste of time.  Before his bishop was blocked so that he would later have to waist time in order to complete development and get it out.  However this is solid at it attacks her LSB and mobilises his other pieces.  Note: mobilization is the most important aspect of chess as haile1996 mentioned in a previous annotation.
135,4,11,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1P1/4n3/3B1N2/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RK1 b kq -',So she responds by attacking his Knight.  The only thing is however that black has other plans.  What are they?
136,4,12,Bh3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1P1/4n3/3B1N1b/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RK1 w kq -',This is it!  Black responds by attacking a piece much more valuable then a Knight her Rook.
137,4,13,Kh1,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1P1/4n3/3B1N1b/PPPP1P1P/RNB2R1K b kq -',?? However white misses the threat.  In this position best was 9.Re1 as this move protects her Rook and puts pressure on the e file.  This move however looses a lot more material after 9...Bxf1.
138,4,14,1Bxf1,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1P1/4n3/5N2/PPPP1P1P/RNB2B1K b kq -',So she looses a Rook and pawn for a bishop.
139,4,15,1Nxg5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1N1/8/8/PPPP1P1P/RNB2B1K b kq -',After that she takes.
140,4,16,1Qxg5,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1q1/8/8/PPPP1P1P/RNB2B1K w kq -',Then he retakes.  The thing is however that it is generally not a good idea to exchange material when you are behind.
141,4,17,1f4,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp1q1/5P2/8/PPPP3P/RNB2B1K b kq f3',? So she responds by forking his Queen and e5 pawn.  However that does not matter or bother black in any way.  In fact this move is another mistake as it looses an additional pawn.
142,4,18,1Qxf4,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/5q2/8/PPPP3P/RNB2B1K w kq -',Now white must be careful or black mates in one.
143,4,19,1Nc3,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/5q2/2N5/PPPP3P/R1B2B1K b kq -',?? And this is her final mistake.  I don't know why she moved there but 13.Bg2 was her only option.  Either way the game is lost but 13.Bg2 would have prevented an immediate mate in one.  Now black has an inevitable mating move after 13...Qxf1#.  
144,4,20,1Qxf1#,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/2N5/PPPP3P/R1B2q1K w kq -',"Here's the moral Erika. You are supposed to develop your minor pieces (Knight followed by bishop) before the Rook+Queen.  In fact your Queen should be the last thing that comes out.  As shakertjie would say ""your main goal should be to develop develop develop"".  Disobeying General Opening Principles and not following the basics will get you in trouble as you saw in this game.  That is because ""What you do in the opening will affect you in the middle game; what you do in the middle game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the end game will affect the final result"" as chesskingdom64 would say.  Also patience is of a virtue.  You lost your cool and patience as you wanted a quick ending to this game.  In most cases being impatient will cause problems inside and outside of chess.  In addition do not always follow the same tactics and strategies because it looks easy.  Afterall ""it's not so easy"" as Jack Stockel would say.  In the other game the opponent was lucky because he or she made mistakes that you did not see.  In this game however you made mistakes that your opponent did see.  Having said that it is not a good idea to assume that your opponent will not see the threat.  Instead it is important to realise that your opponent will see your intentions.  Afterall your opponents plan are just as important as your own.  That was illustrated here.  Remembering this lesson will bring you one step closer to improving your chess skills."

182,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hello my fellow GK players. Here is my latest annotation although this is not my best game but I'm interested to annotate this as a part of lesson in chess. I almost lost on this position but at the end I managed to win because of white careless and overconfidence. Please free to feed any of your criticism and feeback. My opponent open d4 I replied usually against d4 opening by Nf6.
183,6,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',c4 is the usual reply it continue to put pawn influence in center and development of white's queen in c2 b3 and a4.
184,6,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I replied d5. I want to try Queen's Gambit than my usual opening Gruenfeld or later King's Indian Defense.
185,6,3,Qxd5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I take pawn by queen. In my opinion c6 is much better and I can easily equalize. But my move Qxd5 white already have an upperhand on this position.
186,6,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The normal move for white to kick my queen.
187,6,5,Qa5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',My Queen's maneuever was similar to normal move in scandinavian. The differenence white's e pawn is still in e2
188,6,6,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',In my opinion Bd2 is much more stronger than this move. Since it put pressure on my queen
189,6,7,Nc6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/q7/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Before making this move I preferred move c6 but after 5 e4 Bg4 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3 Nbd7 8. 0-0-0 Qxd4 9. Be3 white have a huge advantage.

191,6,9,Qb6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/1qn2n2/8/3PP3/2N2P2/PP1B1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Later I found this move was a mistake the correct move is Qh5 to prevent White's king bishop in h3 (it would prevent my long castling) I make this move to target d pawn and poison b pawn.
192,6,10,Ng6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q3nn1/3P4/4PP2/2N5/PP1B1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Passive move 10...Neg4 are much ok

204,6,22,2Rd2,b'2kr3r/pppn1Npp/8/4P3/1q3n2/8/PPQR3P/1K3B1R b - -',Rd1 is better than Rd2
205,6,23,2Nxd8,b'2kN3r/ppp3pp/8/4n3/1q3n2/8/PPQR3P/1K3B1R b - -',At last white captured one of my miserable rook..
206,6,24,Nxh3,b'2kr4/ppp3pp/8/4n3/1q6/7n/PPQR3P/1K5R w - -',A usual move 
207,6,25,Nd7,b'2kr4/pppn2pp/8/5Q2/1q6/7n/PP1R3P/1K5R w - -',The logical move.

209,6,27,2Rxd7,b'2k5/pppr2pp/8/5Q2/1q6/7n/PP5P/1K5R w - -',after this move white decided to resign. I won against a much higher rated and I didn't expected to win even to draw on my hopeless position. The lesson I've got from this game don't underestimate the position (or your opponent) not because you are in winning position you already won the game.

231,7,21,1bxc6,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p1ppbq1p/2b1p3/4P3/2PP1N1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Maybe that trade wasn't the greatest idea after all.  Now I have my pawns doubled up on the c-file but I am ahead in development.  Seems like a wash.
232,7,22,1b4,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p1ppbq1p/2b1p3/1P2P3/2PP1N1P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - b3',Now he goes for my bishop.

It doesn't really hurt me in any way but 16.d5 was such a better move in this situation.  I could've gotten a pawn off of the c-file and messed with his defenses.  It's not a huge difference but I think that it would've helped some.
242,7,32,1Nh2,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/3pbq1p/b1p1p3/P3P3/R1PP3P/3N1PPN/3Q1RK1 b - -',He positions his knight for attack the next move.
243,7,33,1d5,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/4bq1p/b1ppp3/P3P3/R1PP3P/3N1PPN/3Q1RK1 w - -',Now I move to d5 but the reward isn't as great.

245,7,35,1Qg5,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/4b2p/b1ppp1q1/P3P1N1/R1PP3P/3N1PP1/3Q1RK1 w - -',But no matter I can protect it well enough.  I could've taken his knight with my bishop but then I would've lost a pawn and I wasn't willing to cede material at this point.
246,7,36,1exd5,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/4b2p/b1pPp1q1/P5N1/R1PP3P/3N1PP1/3Q1RK1 b - -',Now he accepts the trade.

248,7,38,2f4,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/7p/b1pbp1q1/P4PN1/R1PP3P/3N2P1/3Q1RK1 b - f3',Now he goes to attack my queen.

253,7,43,2h5,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/8/b1p3qp/P4pN1/R1PP1Q1P/6P1/5RK1 w - -',I go to harass his knight some and hopefully force it back to the 2nd rank.
254,7,44,2Nh2,b'1r3rk1/2p2pp1/8/b1p3qp/P4p2/R1PP1Q1P/6PN/5RK1 b - -',There it goes.  I would've played 22...Nf6 here because it gives the knight another exit square instead of trapping it on h2 for a few moves.
255,7,45,2Rfe8,b'1r2r1k1/2p2pp1/8/b1p3qp/P4p2/R1PP1Q1P/6PN/5RK1 w - -',Now I get my other rook onto an open file.
256,7,46,2Qxf4,b'1r2r1k1/2p2pp1/8/b1p3qp/P4Q2/R1PP3P/6PN/5RK1 b - -',Now he goes for a queen trade which gets us back to the even material.
257,7,47,2Qxf4,b'1r2r1k1/2p2pp1/8/b1p4p/P4q2/R1PP3P/6PN/5RK1 w - -',I accept the trade.

259,7,49,2Re3,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/8/b1p4p/P4R2/R1PPr2P/6PN/6K1 w - -',Now I go to attack his pawns and get my rook into a forward position.  I figured barring 26.c4 he would lose a pawn but he showed me wrong.
260,7,50,2Rf5,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/8/b1p2R1p/P7/R1PPr2P/6PN/6K1 b - -',He sets up for a trade (26... Rxd3 27.Rxc5 Bb6) that would give him a tempo advantage which I wasn't willing to give him at this point.
261,7,51,2Bb6,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/1b6/2p2R1p/P7/R1PPr2P/6PN/6K1 w - -',... So instead I gave him that advantage without taking a piece.  Maybe I should've taken the trade.

266,7,56,2Rd5,b'3r2k1/b1p2pp1/8/P1pR3p/2P5/R2Pr2P/6PN/6K1 b - -',Now he sets up for the rook trade.

348,10,29,2f3,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1qNp3/1pp1P3/Pb3P2/1Q3PP1/6KP/3R4 b - -',I thought about 22. Kg1 first but then this seemed like a better move because it gave me the e4-square and the possibility to advance the king after the g- and h-pawns move forward.
349,10,30,2bxa4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1qNp3/2p1P3/pb3P2/1Q3PP1/6KP/3R4 w - -',Takes a pawn and breaks the pawn island. It is more difficult to advance the isolated pawns without the help of other pieces. Meanwhile I will try to do some damage on the king side.
350,10,31,2Qc4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1qNp3/2p1P3/pbQ2P2/5PP1/6KP/3R4 b - -',I was pondering between this move and 23. Qa2. The more central position of the queen and the possibility to move to the king side made me choose this way.
351,10,32,2h5,b'5rk1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1P2p/pbQ2P2/5PP1/6KP/3R4 w - h6',Ok. Black does not want to stand still on the king side either.
352,10,33,2h3,b'5rk1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1P2p/pbQ2P2/5PPP/6K1/3R4 b - -',Preparing g4. Perhaps direct 23. f5 would have given me an opportunity to fight for a draw. For example 23. f5 exf5 24. Nxf7+!? Qb5 (24...Rxf7 25. Rd8+ Kh7 26. Qxf7 and White wins) 25. Nd6+ Qxc4 26. Nxc4 a3 27. f4 a5 28. Ra1 a4 29. Nxa3 Ra8 30. Nc4 and I am still fighting.
353,10,34,2Rb8,b'1r4k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1P2p/pbQ2P2/5PPP/6K1/3R4 w - -',Black moves the rook away from protecting the f7-pawn. I change my plan and try take advantage of it immediately.
354,10,35,2f5,b'1r4k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1PP1p/pbQ5/5PPP/6K1/3R4 b - -',No g4 needed anymore because Black cannot take with 25...exf5 and after 26. Qxf7+ I have at least a perpetual check.
355,10,36,2Ba5,b'1r4k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/b1p1PP1p/p1Q5/5PPP/6K1/3R4 w - -',But unfortunately it is too late. Now the rook threatens to penetrate my position.
356,10,37,2Qa2,b'1r4k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/b1p1PP1p/p7/5PPP/Q5K1/3R4 b - -',I try to keep the queen on the a2-g8 diagonal while protecting the second rank.
357,10,38,2Rb3,b'6k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/b1p1PP1p/p7/1r3PPP/Q5K1/3R4 w - -',However the third rank is now weak.
358,10,39,2Rf1,b'6k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/b1p1PP1p/p7/1r3PPP/Q5K1/5R2 b - -',Protecting f3 temporarily.
359,10,40,2Bc3,b'6k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1PP1p/p7/1rb2PPP/Q5K1/5R2 w - -',And now I am lost.
360,10,41,2Qe2,b'6k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1PP1p/p7/1rb2PPP/4Q1K1/5R2 b - -',This is a blunder but I lost already earlier.
361,10,42,2Rb2,b'6k1/5pp1/p1qNp3/2p1PP1p/p7/2b2PPP/1r2Q1K1/5R2 w - -',And I resign. A summary of the game: The opening was a kind of Slav Defence where Black took on c4 and kept the pawn. I was worse for the most of the game although Black's advantage was barely winning until the very end. I missed my chance to complicate the game by 24. f5 and 25. Nxf7. After that it was almost impossible to prevent Black from utilizing the b-file and the weak position of the king.

370,11,8,c3,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',So I play the natural
371,11,9,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',He retreats

373,11,11,Nf6,b'rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PP3/2PBB3/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',He develops

378,11,16,Qc2,b'rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3Pn1P1/2PBB3/PPQN1P1P/R3K1NR b KQkq -',I thought after making that move that I could have improved with Nf1 threatening f3 and if he replies Ng5 I have h4 and his knight has nowhere safe to go. However later I realised that f3 can be met with Bh4+ and then Ng5 and I can't play h4. If I try to play Qc2 and 0-0-0 first he can still play Bh4 at some point to frustrate my plans or play c5 followed by exchanging on d5. So I don't think Nf1 is any good and what i played is probably best. I am threatening to exchange on e4 and win a pawn so he exchanges first.

White really shouldn't be worried about losing the e-pawn because it puts black's king on a wide open file. One he controls but still it is something. I recommend something like d4 to keep my options open.

Trying to exploit the kingside one last time. He can't take it because of Qf7+ Qxg8+ which is very bad.Moving the queen also fails to Qh5+. Qg6 is no good because of Rg1. And Ne5 is really bad because of Nxe5 and you are in the same spot.

I didn't want my queen right in front of the king on an open file and a potential pile up on my knight. However after Qa4+ i am down a pawn.

So here is what I have learned from Alekine and Karpov. 1) bind/limit- force your opponent into a never ending cramped position. Forcing your opponent to make further weaknesses to create room to move. 2) Bind some more- use your superior piece position to force your opponent to sacrifice material in order stay alive 3) open lines to the kings with pawn breaks.

739,23,21,2Qf4,b'r1b2rk1/1p4p1/pqn4p/5p2/5Q2/1N1B1P2/PPP4P/2KR3R b - -',again when all else is equal play a move that limits your opponents options. For example I can not prevent black from playing Be6. However with the queen on f4 the Bishop has to stay on e6 and the f-rook has to stay at home. Plus Black also has to be very careful of any attacks on the g-file. 
740,23,22,2Rhe1,b'r4rk1/1p4p1/pqn1b2p/5p2/5Q2/1N1B1P2/PPP4P/2KRR3 b - -',now the gameknot post game engine says this is equal but these types of position always fool engines. But I will make things clear
741,23,23,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1p4p1/pqn4p/5p2/5Q2/1P1B1P2/1PP4P/2KRR3 w - -',White has added superior pawn structure and central dominance to his space advantage. This is more than enough for the win.

745,23,27,2Kb1,b'3r4/1p4pk/1qn2r1p/p4p2/2B2Q1P/1PP2P2/1P6/1K1RR3 b - -',black is so tied down that any move will let white walk right in the door.

Now for those who are reading this from our club I wrote a thread on successful pawn breaks against the castled king. In that thread I posted a diagram of a basic position of where black had played the f-pawn. In this basic pattern the key to a successful attack is controlling the a2-g8 diagonal. And guess who controls it.

749,23,31,3Qxb7,b'5r2/1Q4pk/2n4p/2q2p1P/p1B5/1PP2P2/1P6/1K1R4 b - -',black is forced to take on b3 in order to keep up.

754,23,36,3Kc1,b'2r5/5Bpk/7p/n4p1P/8/1pP2P2/1P6/2KR4 b - -',Now in Rook-Bishop-Pawn vs Rook-Knight-Pawn endings you need a one pawn advantage to win. So either f5 or b3 is gone but black can not defend both. So in a nutshell the game is over. 
755,23,37,4Bxf5,b'2r3k1/4R1p1/7p/n4B1P/5P2/1pP5/1P6/2K5 b - -',for the win!

757,23,39,6Kxa5,b'8/2P3p1/4R1Bp/K4PkP/8/8/8/2r5 b - -',black gets the c-pawn but the white king with make is way unmolested to feast on g7.

762,24,4,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p6/5p2/3PnB2/8/PPPNPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',...but this was a blunder. I thought after NxN my extra central pawn would have somewhat cramped white but I was plainly wrong.

This at least opens the way for my dsb to exchange some white pieces. Another option was d6. But this would have meant to admit b3 was just a wasted tempo.

But it is not mate. I have two precious tempoes to make a counterattack. On the other side my best defence is Kd7 that also protects c6 if Qb4+. But... is defence a good strategy in such a position? I spent a lot of time analyzing if Qxg2 was enough to stop white from playing Qb7. I can even let white take the a8 rook if it gives me a tempo for a perpetual or something... but I missed the simple one.

This game took place in GM Cyrano's Italian Coffee MT in which I played an Expert who had an optimum rating in the 2100s before succumbing to timeoutitis.  I won this game on timeout but Gameknot Analysis gave me a score of -0.50 so I decided to record this game as an Expert Draw rather than an Expert Victory.

As I still had Fou Lenoir on the board and as black had the bishop pair I preferred to keep Henry on a dark square so I did not play K x R.  However it does leave my knight rather passive.  Still I have my extra pawn and another pair of major pieces have been exchanged.  If I can hold my position my extra pawn could still prove decisive.

If black exchanges B for N then although he has a passer on the f column he will concede the bishop pair and make life a little easier for Henry and my rook.  I still keep my extra pawn.  Here my opponent times out on me and I am hoping that Gameknot Analysis will say that my advantage is over +1.00.  Unfortunately it is -0.50 so that Expert Victory still eludes me and I had to be content with simply just about holding my own.  I hope you have all had a good read - Kind regards - Joanne

With Black's 3rd move she adds to her control of e4 by pinning the white knight. It also indicates a willingness to trade the bishop for the knight once White plays a3. This queen move allows White to recapture without doubling his pawns although in that case Black can often then gain time with ...Ne4 forcing the queen to move a third time in the opening. Time pawn structure development and bishop vs. knight are always important to keep in mind but are especially common themes in the Nimzo-Indian.

I'm not overly familiar with the books and just try to play what makes sense in the opening but I realized later that I had entered a position where BLACK has a whopping 54% to 35% advantage in the GK database.

White had not yet moved the king's bishop and by capturing on c4 now Black allows the bishop to develop in one move. If Black waits for the bishop to move and then captures on c4 White has then used two moves to develop the bishop. I think 8... Nc6 (hitting d4) or 8... b6 (eye on e4) were more consistent moves for Black.

I thought Black perhaps intended 10... cxd4 11. cxd4 b5. In that variation White obviously can't play 12. Bxb5 on account of 12... Qxc2. If correct it might explain Black's 8th move. But what would be the point of the b5 advance? Perhaps to create a passed pawn with ...a5 and ...b4? I wasn't sure. Either way the variation above wasn't a major threat (after 11... b5 12. Bd3 works) so I simply castled and completed the king-side development.

Second although Black has now moved the b-pawn just one square 11. Qe2 prevents any shenanigans with White's queen and bishop on the c-file. Lastly it guards the Knight with a piece. However with Black's 10th move I thought I saw another intention of her ninth move and White must be careful. For example 11... Bb7 12. Bd2 Ng4 and now 13... Bxf3 is a major threat that is hard for White to meet. For this reason I was already planning my next move in the event of the reply 11... Bb7 (and it wasn't 12. Bd2).

Pushing a pawn in front of the king does weaken some squares but in this instance a weaker g3 is still manageable especially as Black lacks her dark-squared bishop. It's also useful in general to avoid having to worry about a back rank mate in the future. Of course you don't want to play these preventative moves too often and risk having your opponent dictate your moves. With development mostly complete It was now time for me to devise my plans for the middle game.

Bd3 to contest e4 and potentially push the e-pawn which would open the c1-h6 diagonal and if Black tried to pressure the d-pawn with e5 I could push to d5 with the support of e4 and create a passed pawn. The first plan seemed rather limited so I looked at the second. I thought Black might reply in one of three ways: Rfe8 Ne4 and e5. I decided I could handle e5 although worried about one variation that ended with f3 being forced on White creating ugliness around the king. Rfe8 also ultimately did not discourage me either. Ne4 looked tough. It would force Bb2 or Bxe4 and I liked neither. So I started looking at a4 again and realized Black's best move was 13... Ne4 and I couldn't effectively stop it! I began looking at Nd2. It also eyes e4 and if 13... Ne4 then 14. Nxd2 Bxe4 looked okay. It was a knight on e4 I didn't want and in this situation Black needed three moves (Bb7 Nf6 Ne4) to get back there while White could then play Bd3 and e4. After all this it was clear this was my toughest opponent yet. I played Nd2 and hoped my reasoning was sound.

It would also have prevented the feared Ng4 and would not have weakened g3. But now I was strongly considering f3 with e4 to follow leaving a gaping hole at g3. The question was whether my past mistake would affect my future decisions. If it did I was going to play Bd3 but expect Nf6. Nevertheless I was heavily leaning toward the f3-e4 plan. I didn't want to give Black time for Nf6. I thought that without his dark squared bishop the hole wasn't a big deal. But I was aware of the Knight possibly eyeing g3 via f6 and h5. I thought that in that time I could play Bc1-e3-f2. Also on my mind was that a move earlier I had seen a possible 14... Ne4 15. Nxe4 Bxe4 16. f3 Bb7 17. e4 e5 18. d5 f5 19. d6+. Even if Black were to not blunder into the discovered check she would need an extra move to attack the pawn chain if that course of action was intended. Anyway it was time to forge ahead. I was moving much more quickly after 13. Nd2.

I realized the Kh1 concept was obviously bad on account of what a knight arrival at g3 would mean. I left for work and during my commute figured out a plan that I thought would prevent any knight maneuver. 17. Be3 Nh5 could be met by 18. Rfc1 avoiding a Ng3 fork and if the knight went to f4 or g3 my queen was free guarding from the bishop and could go to d2 forcing the knight right back (even 18... Rfc1 Ng3 19. Qd2 threatens 20. Bf4). So I had to find Black's best move after 17. Be3. A rook to c8 or d8 seemed like a possibility but I didn't see a move that made 17. Be3 bad. I played it.

Bb5 Rd6 presented an opportunity to skewer queen and rook for an exchange if I played g4. So I thought the reply might be Nf6 which would be a concession: I would have repelled the first attempt at invading the dark squares around the king. Of course Black could also play Re8 planning for f6 and Rad8. I remained unconcerned by even hoping for an eventual ...e5 because I would push to d5 and create the passed pawn. So I had all my responses prepared: Bb5 if Rd7 or Re8 Bxe6+ if f6 and Qd2 for all the other anticipated replies.

It was of some use on either c8 or e8 but not much on b8 or f8. But if it only moved between c8 and e8 my bishop could continue harassing it from b5 and a6. So I decided to go for 21. Ba6. If Black went back to e8 I'd play to b5 and offer a draw. The only way Black could refuse a draw was by putting her rook on a sub-optimal square--or trying ...f6.

887,30,2,Ne7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The idea of this position is that the center is completely blocked off so advances are more heavy on each wing of the board. But don't twist it into something it's not. Black's main goal is getting to the weak square d4 but that is a very long plan that takes time. In the meantime he'll settle for attacking on the kingside.

Now this also might have started as the same version but with a transposition given that 2 out of the 4 moves had been played but in a different order.  On the other hand my opponent said ""Different openings have different best moves. 2. d4 is generally played whenever black doesn't advance a pawn two squares.

1077,37,33,Rf2,b'4r1k1/p4pq1/3Q4/3B3p/1PP5/P7/5rPP/3R3K w - -',Not a good move but prevents him to move the bishop for a moment.

I looked at this little brevity from jkarp who managed to reach 1200 today - although he has dropped back I think he is on an upward curve.  However the Master Mater has still shown his opponents that no king is ever safe against him and if they do not watch out they are gonna get Freddied! Sadly King Joe met this fate after less than 15 moves.  Master Freddy is truly back with a vengeance!"
