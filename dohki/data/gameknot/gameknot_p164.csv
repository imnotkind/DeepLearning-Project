In the modern Benoni black usually has trouble developing his LSB due to white's grip on the central light squares. One common plan for black is to exchange it early for white's N after white plays Nf3 via ...Bg4->Bxf3. With the text move this option is no longer available and there's hope of black's LSB getting in the way of coordinating his other pieces.

110,7,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I guess I'll have to start mixing it up sooner or later to prevent deep preparation but so far that's not been necessary. Anyway the Sicilian is in my opinion the best defense to 1. e4.
111,7,1,Bxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1B2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A peculiar move order that gives me a few extra options but none are as good as the main lines.

113,7,3,f5,b'r1bqkb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1Npp2/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I've seen Magnus sticking to 10...Bg7 here probably to avoid some sharper and forced lines. I'm still happy with this move and I don't intend to switch in the near future.
114,7,4,1c3,b'r1bqkb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1Npp2/4P3/N1P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A particularly useful move for White. It covers both d4 and b4 it makes room for the Na3 to be brought into play via c2 and in some lines it allows the White Queen to come into play.
115,7,5,Bxd5,b'r2qk2r/5pbp/p1np4/1p1bpp2/4P3/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Now the game has transposed to a main line of the opening.
116,7,6,Ne7,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp2/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',All very natural moves by both sides. I have a slight worse pawn structure but a temporary superiority in the center.
117,7,7,1Qh5,b'r2q1rk1/4npbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp1Q/8/2PB4/PPN2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I think this is all theory with a rather balanced statistic. I think it would be hard to say White has achieved much from the opening here.
118,7,8,f4,b'r2q1rk1/4npbp/p2p4/1p1P3Q/4pp2/2P5/PPN1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',A rather loose looking move but you cannot afford to play passively with Black. Your only chance is active counterplay or else White will slowly push you off the board.
119,7,9,1a4,b'r2q1rk1/4npbp/p2p4/1p1P3Q/P3pp2/2P5/1PN1BPPP/R4RK1 b - a3',One of White's ideas for counterplay in this line. He attacks my b5 pawn and either forces me to give up a pawn or activate his pieces and be stuck with a weak pawn on the a-file.
120,7,10,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p2p2n1/1p1P3Q/P3ppB1/2P5/1PN2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Trying to win the b5 pawn immediately runs into all sorts of problems. After 19. axb5 f3 20. Bc4 (20. gxf3 Nf4) fxg2 21. Rfe1 (21. Kxg2 Nf4+) axb5 22. Rxa8 Qxa8 23. Bxb5 Qa2! and White's Q-side pawns will fall his pieces are stuck on the wrong side of the board and his King is more vulnerable than mine. With the text White gives up on trying to win the pawn and instead focuses on keeping his Bishop active.
121,7,11,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/5pbp/p2p2n1/1p1P3Q/P3ppB1/2P5/1PN2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Just activating the Rook. The f-file isn't going to open any time soon so the Rf8 was the piece that needed to be activated.
122,7,12,2Ra1,b'q3r1k1/5pbp/3p2n1/1p1P3Q/4ppB1/2P5/1PN2PPP/R5K1 b - -',My opponent swaps a pair of Rooks in order to seize the a-file and gain entry to the weak points on my Q-side.

129,7,19,3Bc6,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/1p1Pr2p/1N3n2/2P2p2/1P3P1P/R4K2 b - -',Now the b5 pawn seems to be a goner.
130,7,20,3Re2,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/1p1P3p/1N3n2/2P2p2/1P2rP1P/R4K2 w - -',Putting the Rook on the most active square. The b2 pawn is attacked and f2 is under pressure as well.
131,7,21,3Rb1,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/1p1P3p/1N3n2/2P2p2/1P2rP1P/1R3K2 b - -',White has to defend or else c3 will become weak after both b-pawns will be removed from the board.
132,7,22,3Nh3,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/1p1P3p/1N6/2P2p1n/1P2rP1P/1R3K2 w - -',Not giving my opponent time to breathe.
133,7,23,3Nd3,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/1p1P3p/8/2PN1p1n/1P2rP1P/1R3K2 b - -',Forced. There is no other way to defend f2.
134,7,24,3b4,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2PN1p1n/1P2rP1P/1R3K2 w - -',Now the b-pawn has turned from a weakling into an attacking piece.
135,7,25,3Re1,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2PN1p1n/1P2rP1P/4RK2 b - -',Since the Nd3 defends b2 as well White proposes a Rook swap to ease the tension in his position.
136,7,26,3Rd2,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2PN1p1n/1P1r1P1P/4RK2 w - -',Still attacking. Now White's main defending piece comes under fire from the hyperactive Rook.
137,7,27,3Re3,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2PNRp1n/1P1r1P1P/5K2 b - -',The Knight couldn't move or else both pawns would have fallen. Defending with Bb5 just loses a pawn after bxc3. Now White wants to mix defending with attacking. He's not only defending his Nd3 but also attacking the f3 pawn the main source of his conundrums.
138,7,28,3Rd1+,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2PNRp1n/1P3P1P/3r1K2 w - -',But now the first rank is weak and I keep on forcing my opponent to make only moves.
139,7,29,3Ne1,b'6k1/5pb1/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2P1Rp1n/1P3P1P/3rNK2 b - -',Again forced.
140,7,30,3Bxc3,b'6k1/5p2/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2b1Rp1n/1P3P1P/3rNK2 w - -',This was a very satisfying move to play. For six moves White has been in the ropes and his position is slowly but surely getting worse. 
141,7,31,3bxc3,b'6k1/5p2/2Bp4/3P3p/1p6/2P1Rp1n/5P1P/3rNK2 b - -',Again forced but a piece for a pawn can't be such a bad deal. Or can it?
142,7,32,3b3,b'6k1/5p2/2Bp4/3P3p/8/1pP1Rp1n/5P1P/3rNK2 w - -',Now the pawn is two steps away from Queening and all of White's pieces are poorly placed to stop it. His Knight is pinned his Rook is stuck on the third rank suffocated by its own pieces and the Bishop needs two moves to get into the action.
143,7,33,3Re8+,b'4R1k1/5p2/2Bp4/3P3p/8/1pP2p1n/5P1P/3rNK2 b - -',The fatal error. White's best shot was 37. Bd7 b2 38. Bf5 Rxd5 39. c4 Rxf5 40. Rb3 Rf4 41. Rxb2 Ng5 42. Rc2 and although White will suffer I think he can draw this ending since my pawn structure doesn't allow me to make too much progress. With the move in the game White keeps his Bishop stuck on c6 and allows me activate my last piece my King.
144,7,34,Nf4,b'1R6/5pk1/2Bp4/3P3p/5n2/1pP2p2/5P1P/3rNK2 w - -',Another blow for White. Now Nd3 is a deadly threat much more important than a pawn Queening.
145,7,35,3Ba4,b'1R6/5pk1/3p4/3P3p/B4n2/1pP2p2/5P1P/3rNK2 b - -',Finally bringing the Bishop into play but still rather clumsily.
146,7,36,3Ng2,b'1R6/5pk1/3p4/3P3p/B7/1pP2p2/5PnP/3rNK2 w - -',Forcing White to swing back the Rook to stave off mate.
147,7,37,b2,b'4R3/5pk1/3p4/3P3p/B7/2P2p2/1p3PnP/3rNK2 w - -',And the pawn is saved once more. Quite a metamorphosis from a weak pawn on b5 this pawn that was looking like dead meat just ten moves ago has now become the star player on the chess board.
148,7,38,4Bc2,b'4R3/5pk1/3p4/3P3p/8/2P2p2/1pB2PnP/3rNK2 b - -',The only way to stop the pawn from Queening.
149,7,39,4Rc1,b'4R3/5pk1/3p4/3P3p/8/2P2p2/1pB2PnP/2r1NK2 w - -',The Rook seems even more active on the first rank that it was on the second.
150,7,40,Kf6,b'4R3/5p2/3p1k2/3P1B1p/8/2P2p2/1p3PnP/2r1NK2 w - -',Bringing his majesty into the fray.

152,7,42,4Bd3,b'4R3/5p2/3p4/3P2kp/8/2PB1p2/1p3PnP/2r1NK2 b - -',It's hard to suggest anything better.
153,7,43,4Nxe1,b'4R3/5p2/3p4/3P2kp/8/2PB1p2/1p3P1P/2r1nK2 w - -',The simplest way.
154,7,44,Rxc3,b'8/5p2/3p4/3P2kp/8/2rB1p2/1p3P1P/4RK2 w - -',Here my opponent resigned. I guess he saw the zugzwang that would arise after 46. Be4 Rc1! when White is simply out of moves. All he can do is shuffle the Bishop on d3 and b1 while I march the King to the h-file capture the White pawn and then simple advance my h-pawn. I really enjoyed playing this game and I hope you enjoy playing through it. I haven't had such a long sequence of forcing moves leading from apparently equal to worse position to a devastating attack with very few pieces. Also I'd say the b-pawn was the star player of the game. He got saved in extremis then he was given a free way to advance and then paralyzed White with just that threat alone.

187,8,32,2Qe7,b'5bk1/p3q3/4r1p1/3Qpp1p/PP1P4/2P5/1B3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So I didn't expect that queen was already protecting the e pawn.
188,8,33,2dxe5,b'5bk1/p3q3/4r1p1/3QPp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Another pawn plus isn't that nice?
189,8,34,2Kh7,b'5b2/p3q2k/4r1p1/3QPp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Walking out of the pin.
190,8,35,2Rad1,b'5b2/p3q2k/4r1p1/3QPp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Doubling with thoughts of exchanging the queens.
191,8,36,2Bg7,b'8/p3q1bk/4r1p1/3QPp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Attacking the pawn that isn't an issue let's force the exchange.
192,8,37,Bxe5,b'8/p2Qq2k/4r1p1/4bp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',He captured as I was sure he would.
193,8,38,2Qxe7+,b'8/p3Q2k/4r1p1/4bp1p/PP6/2P5/1B3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Exchange.
194,8,39,2c4,b'8/p3r2k/6p1/4bp1p/PPP5/8/1B3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',And now bullet throw the heart he's next move should be bf6 or bd6 or he is loosing the rook.
195,8,40,3Rxe7+,b'8/p3R2k/6p1/5p1p/PPP5/8/1b3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',And no he resigned and for sure reasons he will lose another pawn and I will be 10+ good game for him.
196,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I prefer facing e4 to d4.  I have never studied the Siciliian lines; I sometimes play the Caro Cann but my favorite response is the French defense.
197,9,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I think this move is probably good since black in this position wants to play d5.
198,9,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',After this simplification the position appears equal and white has many possible continuations to consider.
199,9,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',The board begins to take on the characteristics of a closed game.
200,9,4,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I am pretty sure this is OK but maybe just c6 would've been more solid.
201,9,5,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I think this move is a bit passive for white although it is obviously OK.
202,9,6,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I think c6 in this position is better than c5 because of nxc6 but maybe there was something else good.
203,9,7,Qe2+,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',I don't like this move for white but maybe the idea is to prepare O-O-O.
204,9,8,Be6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',I think this is better than ne7.
205,9,9,a3,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3p4/1b1P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',A normal move but maybe bd6 or be7 and black is now better.
206,9,10,Ng5,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbb3/3p2N1/3P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This move looked threatening at first because of the weakness on e6.  But I think the attack can be parried and here I prepare to do so.
207,9,11,Qf6,b'r3k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbbq2/3p2N1/3P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I think qe7 is also playable and could have been better or maybe you are able to see something better here.
208,9,12,fxe6,b'r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/2pbpq2/3p4/3P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Although the weakness on e6 persists I think black is getting a very comfortable position.  White's d-pawn is obviously going to be under fire and his bishop on f1 is blocked from natural development by the queen.  Maybe f4 would have inhibited e5 and white has to be concerned about f4.  White's priority might be to inhibit e5.  But first of course white has to prop up d4.
209,9,13,1Qh5+,b'r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/2pbpq2/3p3Q/3P4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I think this may be a blunder.
210,9,14,1Qh3,b'r3k1nr/pp1n3p/2pbpqp1/3p4/3P4/P1N4Q/1PPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Here d4 is immune because of qe6+.  E5 may be a possible continuation for black.
211,9,15,1O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/pp1n3p/2pbpqp1/3p4/3P4/P1N4Q/1PPB1PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',I thought the black position was comely and very playable.  A glance at the position reveals that white has the bishop pair which could be considered an advantage.  On the other hand I have an idea about keeping the board closed winning f2 (which at present can't be played because of qxe6) getting knights on e4 and c4 and playing e5.
212,9,16,Nf5,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2pbpqp1/3p1n2/3P4/P1N4Q/1PPBBPPP/2KR3R w - -',Threatening nxd4.
213,9,17,1Bg4,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2pb1qp1/3ppn2/3P2B1/P1N1B2Q/1PP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',This move seems to introduce some tactics and black could end up with an isolated f-pawn.
214,9,18,1e4,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2pb1qp1/3p1n2/3Pp1B1/P1N1B2Q/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',I just pushed e4 because I thought I can still win d4 and my pawns in the center will be decisive.
215,9,19,1Ne2,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2pb1qp1/3p1n2/3Pp1B1/P3B2Q/1PP1NPPP/2KR3R b - -',Looking to play ng3 and get a third piece attacking my knight.  Also possible for white would be nf4 looking to trade off my bishop.
216,9,20,1Qg7,b'2kr3r/pp1n2qp/2pb2p1/3p1n2/3Pp1B1/P3B2Q/1PP1NPPP/2KR3R w - -',Inviting an exchange of f5 that will leave white up a pawn.  I had seen this and thought black would get good counterplay after qxf5.
217,9,21,1Nf4,b'2kr3r/pp1n2qp/2pb4/3p1p2/3PpN2/P3B2Q/1PP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',But he avoids qf5.  White seems to have a strong knight here on f4.
218,9,22,1Bxf4,b'2kr3r/pp1n2qp/2p5/3p1p2/3Ppb2/P3B2Q/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',I decide the knight was too strong and must go.  The loss of my bishop could be telling since the black squares around my king are weak.
219,9,23,Qf6,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2p2q2/3p1p2/3PpB2/P6Q/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Just protecting the f5 pawn.  My d7 knight isn't very good at all but I have a strong pawn presence in the center.  I would be interested to know how you assess this position for black.
220,9,24,2Qb3,b'2kr3r/pp1n3p/2p2q2/3p1p2/3PpB2/PQ6/1PP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',Maybe there are ideas of qa4 but I think black is pretty solid on the queenside.
221,9,25,2Nb6,b'2kr3r/pp5p/1np2q2/3p1p2/3PpB2/PQ6/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',I finally try to get my knight into the action.
222,9,26,Nc4,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p2q2/3p1p2/2nPpB1P/PQ6/1PP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',This move appears to be a blunder because black is losing the exchange.
223,9,27,Qd6,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2pq4/3p1pB1/2nPp2P/PQ6/1PP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',But there is still a lot of play in the position after bd8 and rd8.  Maybe black can make use of the g file with rg8.
224,9,28,2Qh3,b'2kr4/pp5p/2pq4/3p1p2/2nPp2P/P6Q/1PP2PP1/2KR3R b - -',And white is back to pressuring f5.  Being up material white can hope to exchange pieces off and cruise to a winning endgame.  Black needs to quickly develop some threats to avoid being ground down.
225,9,29,2Qf4+,b'2kr4/pp5p/2p5/3p1p2/2nPpq1P/P6Q/1PP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Defending f4 and threatening qxf2.
226,9,30,Rg8,b'2k3r1/pp5p/2p5/3p1p2/2nPpq1P/P6Q/1PP2PP1/1K1R3R w - -',I didn't go in for the pawn because I would have lost f5 after rf1.
227,9,31,Qxf2,b'2k3r1/pp5p/2p5/3p1p2/2nPp2P/P5PQ/1PP2q2/1K1R3R w - -',But here I play it because I have pressure on g3.
228,9,32,Rxg3,b'2k5/pp5p/2p5/3p1p2/2nPp2P/P5rQ/1PP2q2/1K1R1R2 w - -',And I equalize in material and threaten to take h4 if rxf5.
229,9,33,3Rxf5,b'2k5/pp5p/2p5/3p1R2/2nPp2P/P5r1/1PP5/1K1R4 b - -',In this position I have a pawn for the exchange but the situation looks pretty bad for black.
230,9,34,3Rh5,b'2k5/pp5p/2p5/3p3R/2nPp2P/P6r/1PP5/1K1R4 b - -',Time began to get low on my clock and I struggled to find a good move here.  
231,9,35,3b5,b'2k5/p6p/2p5/1p1p3R/2nPp2P/P6r/1PP5/1K1R4 w - b6',Please tell me if you think there is a better move in this critical position.
232,9,36,e3,b'2k5/p6R/2p5/1p1p4/2nP3P/P3p2r/1PP5/1K1R4 w - -',I biked the e3 pawn because time was running low for both players and I wanted to create complications for white.  Here I intend to tie his d1 rook down.
233,9,37,Nd6,b'2k5/p6R/2pn4/1p1p4/3P3P/P3p2r/1PP5/1K2R3 w - -',Nf4 would be strong because it threatens d4 and h4.
234,9,38,3h5,b'2k5/p6R/2pn4/1p1p3P/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/1K2R3 b - -',White has his own passed pawn he looks to promote.
235,9,39,3Nf5,b'2k5/p6R/2p5/1p1p1n1P/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/1K2R3 w - -',I play nf5 anyway threatening d4 and guarding the h6 square.
236,9,40,3h6,b'2k5/p6R/2p4P/1p1p1n2/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/1K2R3 b - -',White plays h6 because if black accepts the sacrifice his knight will be pinned.
237,9,41,3Nxh6,b'2k5/p6R/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/1K2R3 w - -',I took it anyway.  Please let me know if you see anything better here.
238,9,42,3Kc1,b'7R/p2k4/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/2K1R3 b - -',He wants to activate his king but the board is not yet settled and black's king could prove exposed.
239,9,43,3Ke7,b'7R/p3k3/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/2K1R3 w - -',I am sure there are stronger moves here but I wanted to centralize the king and drive the h8 rook off the h file.
240,9,44,3Rg1,b'7R/p3k3/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P3p2r/1PP5/2K3R1 b - -',Though it threatens the menacing rg7+ this move allows me to inch my pawn down the board.
241,9,45,Rh2,b'7R/p3k3/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P7/1PPKp2r/6R1 w - -',Black's only defense.  It is looking like black's best hope to win - the e2 pawn - may be mopped up after re1.
242,9,46,4Ke1,b'7R/p3k3/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P7/1PP1p2r/4K1R1 b - -',Where re1 was clearly superior and probably winning.  It was a blitz game and time was short and here white makes a crucial mistake.
243,9,47,4Kf7,b'7R/p4k2/2p4n/1p1p4/3P4/P7/1PP1p2r/4K1R1 w - -',With the knight still pinned I don't see anything more concrete.
244,9,48,4Rxa7,b'8/R7/2p2k1n/1p1p4/3P4/P7/1PP1p2r/4K1R1 b - -',A materialistic move from white lets black stir up an attack.
245,9,49,4Ra6,b'8/8/R1p2k2/1p1p1n2/3P4/P7/1PP1p2r/4K1R1 b - -',The knight covers the g7 square where white could have doubled rooks.
246,9,50,4Nxd4,b'8/8/R1p2k2/1p1p4/3n4/P7/1PP1p2r/4K1R1 w - -',Black is now coming in for the attack.  Defending c6 and threatening Nf3#.
247,9,51,4c3,b'8/8/R1p2k2/1p1p4/3n4/P1P5/1P2p2r/4K1R1 b - -',And he allows me to finish off the game with a nice knight's move and the e2 pawn though never promoted playing an important part in the mate.
248,9,52,4Nf3#,b'8/8/R1p2k2/1p1p4/8/P1P2n2/1P2p2r/4K1R1 w - -',
249,10,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',As in our last game my opponent chose the English but I responded differently.
250,10,1,a3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/P5P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Seems a slightly odd response to ...Be7 but I suppose it prepares Queenside expansion coupled with Queenside fianchetto.
251,10,2,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pbppp/2p2n2/4p3/2P5/P1N3P1/1P1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',This move demonstrates the old observation that every move has its advantages and disadvantages: the pawn advance contests control of d5 and b5 but deprives the QN of its most active square
252,10,3,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/P1NP2P1/1P2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',I felt the need to prepare for the development of my Queenside but couldn't yet commit to ...d5 because the sums didn't work..  
253,10,4,1f3,b'1r3rk1/1b2qppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P2P3/P4PP1/4P1BP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',From my point of view the first mysterious move of the game.  It defends e4 while blocking in White's fianchettoed bishop and appears to prepare g4 but also exposes the K on the g1-a7 diagonal not that Black can exploit it.
254,10,5,1Bh3,b'2r2rk1/1b2qppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P2P3/P4PPB/4P2P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',? So Black immediately invites White to reactivate his B.
255,10,6,1Rc4,b'5rk1/1b2qppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1Pr1P3/P4PPB/4P2P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',? Advancing a Rook to no particular purpose is always risky
256,10,7,Be6,b'5rk1/4qppp/p2pbn2/1p2p3/1Pr1P3/P3BPP1/4P1BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',At least I've redeveloped my B where it is no longer biting on granite.
257,10,8,Rxc4,b'6k1/4qppp/p2pbn2/1p2p3/1Pr1P3/P3BPP1/4P1BP/3Q1RK1 w - -',? Recapturing with the wrong piece.  As a general principle it is always better to have the heavy artillery behind the lighter fighters.  This R soon becomes embarrassed losing me the game.
258,10,9,d5,b'6k1/4qppp/p3bn2/1p1pp3/1Pr1P3/P3BPP1/3QP1BP/5RK1 w - -',I thought I was winning with this move...
259,10,10,2Bc5,b'6k1/4qppp/p3b3/1pBnp3/1Pr5/P4PP1/3QP1BP/5RK1 b - -',This move seals in the errant Rook while assaulting the Q.
260,10,11,2e4,b'6k1/2q2ppp/p3b3/1pBnp3/1Pr1P3/P4PP1/3Q2BP/5RK1 b - e3',Not only does this attack the Knight but it also cuts off the Rook's lateral options and opens up a potential line of attack for the Bg2 from f1.
261,10,12,2Rd1,b'6k1/2q2ppp/pn2b3/1pB1p3/1Pr1P3/P4PP1/3Q2BP/3R2K1 b - -',Now there's a serious back-row mate threat to be followed by an attack on that errant R.
262,10,13,Qxa3,b'3Q4/5kpp/p3bp2/4p3/2p1P1P1/q4P2/6KP/3R4 w - -',Black's chances seem to lie in promoting a Queenside pawn so this is logical pawn-grabbing.
263,10,14,c3,b'3Q4/5kpp/p2Rbp2/4p3/4P1P1/2p2PK1/q6P/8 w - -',?? This seems to throw a valuable pawn away.
264,10,15,3Qe7,b'8/4Q1pp/p2Rbpk1/4p3/4P1P1/2p2PK1/q6P/8 b - -',But White finds a more direct attack.
265,10,16,3Bf7,b'8/4Qbpp/p2R1pk1/4p3/4P1P1/2p2PK1/q6P/8 w - -',? Given White's response this move is inadequate.  It was probably better to advance the c-pawn again giving up the B.
266,10,17,3Qxe5,b'8/5bpp/p2R1pk1/4Q3/4P1P1/2p2PK1/q6P/8 b - -',!  I'd completely missed this capture exploiting the pin on my 3rd rank.  Now mate in 1 is threatened (Qh5).
267,10,18,gxf6,b'8/5b1p/p2R1p1k/4Q3/4P2P/2p2PK1/q7/8 w - -',? Overlooking another pin on the 3rd rank.  It was probably impossible to avoid imminent mate but to overlook the immediate was unforgiveable.  If I'd played this knowing I was going to be mated next move I wouldn't mind ...  At least he took a couple of minutes to see it himself!
268,10,19,4Qg5#,b'8/5b1p/p2R1p1k/6Q1/4P2P/2p2PK1/q7/8 b - -',
269,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was one of my greatest games enjoy!
270,11,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Scandinavian better than Sicilian or 1.e5 for me.
271,11,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My opponent doesn't comply so...
272,11,3,exf6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5P2/3p4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now i thought about gxf6 or nxf6 i chose the knight.
273,11,4,Qf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p4/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',kinda purposeless and a little bit early.
274,11,5,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3pp3/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq e6',Taking full control of the center.
275,11,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/1B1pp3/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',C6 nothing special.
276,11,7,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3pp3/B5b1/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Striking at the queen and developing with tempo.
277,11,8,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3pp3/B5b1/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',aiming b7 but that is no problem
278,11,9,Na6,b'r2qkb1r/pp4pp/n1p2n2/3pp3/B5b1/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',If qxb7 then nc5 and after that rb8 it is worth for that pawn.
279,11,10,Qg3,b'r2qkb1r/pp4pp/n1p2n2/3pp3/B5b1/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',so my opponent makes a strange move again with no purpose.
280,11,11,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pp4pp/n1pb1n2/3pp3/B5b1/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Trying an e4 next move.
281,11,12,h3,b'r2qk2r/pp4pp/n1pb1n2/3pp3/B5b1/6QP/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',If he attacks my bishop then i attack his :).

It is uncommon but playable and does not oblige black all the delicious counterplay with rook artillery firing on the a and b files in tandem with a fianchettoed KB that black usually receives in the Volga Gambit accepted (4. cb a6 5. ba Bxa6).  The idea behind 4. Qc2 is to play e4 immediately.

On a side note after white moves the queen black should not be to hastie in play NxB because the Knight on D4 practical shuts white down.

I like playing with my Bishops against his Knights so if he wants to trade I will oblige him.  I will continue to develop my pieces in an attempt to gain space.

His pawn structure on the Queen side is very strange to me.  Don't think that I have seen one like this before.   Now to mess with his King side pawn structure.

I would have taken the Bishop with the King and then developed the Knight and moved the Bishop to h4 to attack the White Queen.

If I retreat my Queen it just lets him chase her around that side of the board lets him develop pieces on the Kings side of the board and could in the long run get my Queen trapped.  I am sure that Black will take my Queen but another line is 21. ... f7xe6 22. Bxe6+ Kh7 (which could be a bit better for Black that what he did)
707,24,23,Rxf8,b'5rk1/5p2/3b1npp/2p5/pp1pP3/P2P1P1P/BPP3P1/R4RK1 w - -',Now I am only a pawn ahead and a Rook for a Bishop but my pawn structure is strong and his Bishop is dark while my pawns are for the most part on the light squares.

While I'm no master at naming certain openings or plays or even strategies I could see from this point that the game could easily take a turn where simply setting up an attack and/or exchanging pieces was not going to get either player anywhere forcing the situation so that the first to make a mistake would be the one that loses not the one that outsmarts the other."

812,29,1,Qg5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/6q1/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',The g2 pawn is momentarily available.  Pushing it opens the rook diagonal which I can exploit well if ever QxPe4 becomes available.
813,29,2,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/6q1/2B1P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White's threat to the queen is a better response--it helps him develop a piece.
814,29,3,Qxe4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1q3/P4N2/1B3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Well it's a free pawn now.

Black knows Qd7 is bad because it permits white's bishop to pin with Bb5 but there is still the pawn at c7 guarded by Nb8 to intervene.  Black is also eying the white knight with Qd6.

824,29,13,Qxb7,b'r4rk1/pq3pbp/1pn1Pp2/1Bpp4/8/P7/2Q3PP/1R2R1K1 w - -',The knight is more valuable than the pawn.
825,29,14,2Qa4,b'r4rk1/pq3pbp/1pn1Pp2/1Bpp4/Q7/P7/6PP/1R2R1K1 b - -',If black protects the knight with Ra8c8 white will respond by pinning black's queen with Ba6.  Rf8c8 is similarly bad for the same reason.  Black was screaming and crying in pain and dismay at this particular juncture even though he was still 6 points up.
826,29,15,2Bxc6,b'r4rk1/pq4bp/1pB1pp2/2pp4/Q7/P7/6PP/1R2R1K1 b - -',Black kisses the a rook goodbye.

828,29,17,2Rxe6,b'3r1rk1/p3q1bp/1p2Rp2/2pB4/Q7/P7/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',Black cannot move his queen anywhere it won't get traded for a rook with a discovered check.  White's bishop isn't protected however.  So black's next move is only slightly foolish looking.
829,29,18,3Bc4,b'3r1rk1/p4qbp/1p2Rp2/2p5/Q1B5/P7/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',White must have wanted to improve his position by protecting the bishop.  Black can ease up on the pressure by moving the king off the white square.
830,29,19,3Kh8,b'3r1r1k/p4qbp/1p2Rp2/2p5/Q1B5/P7/6PP/1R4K1 w - -',Now black's queen is free.

877,32,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Tal possibly wanted to make this opening a bit unusual instead of 3. d4 as he knows that kasparov is well prepeared to play the sicilian. Kasparov probably has something stored for this move but since this is a blitz game (as i mentioned earlier) and the middle game will be more thinking than showing preperationskasparov might have some problems with time. When it comes to Tal well he must have prepeared something with Bb5+.
878,32,5,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Kasparov played Nd7eyeing a potential outpost on e5 perhaps.

And now suddenly out of nowhere (unfortunately!) kasparov lost on time. He probably spend time thinking on how to react to this knight sacrifice. I would have been very pleased to see how this game would have gone if Kasparov didn't loose on time. Maybe Ne6+ comes on the right moment? who knows. So this was a nice last game by Tal. He opened with his favorite e4 and managed to make a sacrifice against kasparov. gg.

955,35,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I wanted to play aggressively so I try to introduce imbalances early here on the second move.  White is prepared to play e3 if d/c.
956,35,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',An extremely vigorous reply.  This looks like a gambit of some kind and I would be really interested to know the name of this opening.
957,35,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I am not sure if this is the correct move and would like to know.

959,35,4,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/2p5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',D5 really ups the ante now that white is gambiting a pawn.  I just wanted to keep the position as fluid and complicated as possible.  Sometimes as here I play a move that looks intuitively good to me without a lot of calculation.  I am pretty sure black can undermine and win the d pawn but on the other hand the pawn while it remains is pretty annoying from black's perspective.  An early advanced pawn can be distracting and could hinder black's development.
960,35,5,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/2p5/2b1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So black is immediately giving up his dark-squared bishop.  I wonder about this move though.  It is going to be an open board and maybe white will play e4 followed by be3.
961,35,6,e4,b'rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/8/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',He elects to defend c4 and I am able to defend d5.

963,35,8,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/5n2/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BP2/P5PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',White does have a potential problem here since he is still at least three moves from castling.
964,35,9,1Ne2,b'rnbq1rk1/p1p2pp1/5n1p/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BP2/P3N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Preparing to play Ng3 and be2.

966,35,11,1Ng3,b'rnb2rk1/p1p1qpp1/5n1p/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BPN1/P5PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Inviting qa3 if that was the intent and vacating e2 for the bishop.

I guess the idea is to threaten nc5 or nb4 but after nb4 the knight is still going to be defended by the queen alone and maybe it will be a liability.
969,35,14,Bd7,b'r4rk1/p1pbqpp1/n4n1p/3Pp3/1pB1P3/2P1BPN1/P1Q3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black blundered terribly here and just lost a piece.  It was a blitz game after all.

973,35,18,Nxd5,b'r4rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p1BP2/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 w - -',I think black is playing very solidly here.  He is only a pawn down here.
974,35,19,1Bf2,b'r4rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R4RK1 b - -',I think the idea here was to keep the bishop for bg3.
975,35,20,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R4RK1 w - -',During the game this move didn't seem that critical to me.  But let me know what you think about it.  
976,35,21,1Rfe1,b'3r1rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R3R1K1 b - -',With ideas of f4.

979,35,24,2f5,b'3r1rk1/p3q3/B1p3Pp/3npp2/8/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R3R1K1 w - f6',! I think this is a fairly creative move since it would at first seem that the white queen is coming in with decisive effect.
980,35,25,2Bc4,b'3r1rk1/p3q3/2p3Pp/3npp2/2B5/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Just pinning that knight and qc3 is on.
981,35,26,2Qb4,b'3r1rk1/p7/2p3Pp/3npp2/1qB5/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I wonder if black has made another mistake in this critical position.  I feel that if I can weather the tactical threats black is subjecting me to the g6 pawn will tell.
982,35,27,Rxd5,b'5rk1/p7/2p3Pp/3rpp2/1q6/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I admit that taking may not have been the best continuation for white although I am up material here.
983,35,28,2Rb7,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3rpp2/2q5/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/4R1K1 b - -',Would you call this rb7 crushing?  Maybe I could have followed up with an immediate rh7 and been much better.
984,35,29,2e4,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3r1p2/2q1p3/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/4R1K1 w - -',Aggressive play from black.  E3 is obviously not playable at the moment and is e/f really that strong for black?
985,35,30,2Be3,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3r1p2/2q1p3/2p1BP2/P1Q3PP/4R1K1 b - -',And here I played the nice move be3.  The threat is simply bh6 after which rh7 will be absolutely killing.
986,35,31,2exf3,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3r1p2/2q5/2p1Bp2/P1Q3PP/4R1K1 w - -',Bh6 seemed a possible move here but maybe I am wrong.  The move that will bring me closer to victory will also take me nearer defeat as f2+ would appear to win the white queen.
987,35,32,2gxf3,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3r1p2/2q5/2p1BP2/P1Q4P/4R1K1 b - -',Here I again assessed the position as favorable for white.  Clearly it is imperative for white to keep control of g4.
988,35,33,2f4,b'5rk1/pR6/2p3Pp/3r4/2q2p2/2p1BP2/P1Q4P/4R1K1 w - -',Besides threatening to win the bishop I think this is a good move because of the threat of rff5. But here I find a truly beautiful idea.  I find a queen sacrifice after g7.
989,35,34,Rg5+,b'5rk1/pR4P1/2p4p/6r1/2q2p2/2p1BP2/P1Q4P/4R1K1 w - -',But I can't play qh7+.  Will I get a chance?

991,35,36,Qh4+,b'5rk1/pR4P1/2p4p/6r1/7q/2p1RP2/P1Q2K1P/8 w - -',Black only has this check and white would still have qh7+ but my king is getting really uncomfortable.
992,35,37,Rg1+,b'5rk1/pR4P1/2p4p/8/8/2p1RP1q/P1Q4P/4K1r1 w - -',And this move is really crushing since I am losing my queen now.
993,35,38,Rg2+,b'5rk1/pR4P1/2p4p/8/8/2p1RP1q/P1Q1K1rP/8 w - -',And it's all over.
994,36,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This was the starting position. The Sicilian often makes for very great and exciting games. Usually White gets a lead in development and chances of attack on the King's side while Black has counterplay on the queen's side and on the open c-file.
995,36,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Open Sicilian. In this opening the motifs I mentioned are shown very clearly.
996,36,2,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',After this exchange Black has an open c file and two central pawns (white only has one) but White can develop faster and more easily.
997,36,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The first time I deviate from the most-played moves in the database. Usually 5...a6 is played here which is called the Najdorf. 5...g6 as played in the game is the Dragon variation. This is a very sharp opening with chances for both sides. Black is planning to play ...Bg7 ...O-O ...Rc8 ...Qa5 and push the pawns on the queenside (in this game we don't see Black pushing his pawns) and his attack often involves a Rook sac on c3 after it has moved to c8. White has ideas of an attack on the position of the Black King (which will be on g8) for example with Be3 Bc4 (or Be2 as in this game) Qd2 O-O-O and push the pawns on the kingside. I like to play this as both sides.
998,36,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',!? A rare response from White usually considered quite harmless. 6.Be3 is the book move.
999,36,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This Bishop will become a monster later on.
1000,36,6,Be2,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',?! White misses something.
1001,36,7,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?! And so does Black. He could have played 8...Nxe4 9.Nxc6 Nxd2 10.Nxd8 Bxc3 11.bxc3 as pointed out by the GK analysis as well as Fritz on my computer. This gives him a slight advantage.
1002,36,8,h4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/3NP2P/2N5/PPPQBPP1/R3K2R b KQ h3',White starts his attack on the kingside.
1003,36,9,Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3nP2P/2N5/PPPQBPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Black exchanges as he can later gain a tempo with a discovered attack on the Queen. Moreover the Knight on d4 was strong.
1004,36,10,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1npp/6B1/3QP2P/2N5/PPP1BPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Chasing the Bishop away.

1006,36,12,1h5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/7p/3QP2P/2N1B3/PPP1BPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',!? But Black wants to stop the pawn march on the king's side first. However the immediate 11.Ng4 was better. White has to move the Queen (12.Qd3) and then Black can exchange on e3 gaining the bishop pair in a fairly open position.
1007,36,13,1O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/7p/3QP2P/2N1B3/PPP1BPP1/2KR3R b - -',?! Obviously White doesn't care about the Bishop pair and continues his plan (as mentioned on move 5).
1008,36,14,1Ng4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p2p1/7p/3QP1nP/2N1B3/PPP1BPP1/2KR3R w - -',But now Black does take advantage of that.
1009,36,15,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppb1/3pb1p1/7p/4P2P/2N1Q3/PPP1BPP1/2KR3R w - -',The immediate 14...Qa5 was better as the Knight has to remain on c3 to protect a2. Now it can jump to d5 with a slight advantage for White according to Fritz.
1010,36,16,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppb1/3pb1p1/7p/4P2P/2N1QP2/PPP1B1P1/2KR3R b - -',?! However White doesn't take advantage of that.

1013,36,19,Qa4,b'2r2rk1/pp2ppb1/3pb1p1/3N3p/q3P2P/P3QP2/1PP1B1P1/2KR3R w - -',?! This is my only real oversight of the game. I was planning to exchange on d5 and play ...Qa4 and thought the move order didn't matter because ...Qa4 would threaten mate. However I missed something important...
1014,36,20,1Rd2,b'2r2rk1/pp2ppb1/3pb1p1/3N3p/q3P2P/P3QP2/1PPRB1P1/2K4R b - -',? Fortunately for me my opponent misses this too. With 18.Nxe7+ Kh7 19.Nxc8 Rxc8 he would have won an exchange and a pawn. Black clearly has compensation but will this be enough? The GK analysis gives White +1 while Fritz says it's an equal position.
1015,36,21,Rc7,b'5rk1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3p/q6P/P3QP2/1PPRB1P1/2K4R w - -',Missing the beautiful 19...Bc3!! 20.Rd1 (20.bxc3? Qxa3+ 21.Kb1 Rc5! and White has to sac his queen to avoid mate)... Didn't I say something about sacs on c3?
1016,36,22,2g4,b'5rk1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3p/q5PP/P3QP2/1PPRB3/2K4R b - g3',? The king has to get off the c file!
1017,36,23,2Bd1,b'2r3k1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3p/q5PP/P3QP2/1PPR4/2KB3R b - -',? Again there's a sacrifice possibility on c3...
1018,36,24,2Qc4,b'2r3k1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3p/2q3PP/P3QP2/1PPR4/2KB3R w - -',? And again I miss it. 21...Rc3!! was winning because 22.bxc3? fails to 22...Qxa3+ 23.Kb1 Bxc3 and White has to sac his queen to avoid mate.
1019,36,25,2gxh5,b'2r3k1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/2q4P/P3QP2/1PPR4/2KB3R b - -',?? This was the last chance for White to stay in the game. He had to play 22.Kb1 to avoid Black's next move.
1020,36,26,2Qa2,b'2r3k1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/7P/P3QP2/qPPR4/2KB3R w - -',! I didn't even consier taking back on h5 and indeed that would have led to disaster: 22...gxh5?? 23.Rg1 an Qh6 will follow with suddenly a crushig attack for White! Now it's Black who strikes first and finally the fianchetto Bishop on g7 shows its strength.
1021,36,27,2Rg2,b'2r3k1/ppr1ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/7P/P3QP2/qPP3R1/2KB3R b - -',"? Now White loses the Rook by force. 23.Rd4 was hite's ""best"" option but that's just sacrificing an exchange to try to stop Black's attack. 23.Rd3?? wouldn't help either: 23...Bxb2+! 24.Kd2 Bc1+ wins the Queen."
1022,36,28,Rc7xc2+,b'2r3k1/pp2ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/7P/P3QP2/1qrK2R1/3B3R w - -',! The winning sac.
1023,36,29,2Bxc2,b'2r3k1/pp2ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/7P/P3QP2/1qBK2R1/7R b - -',? It's mate in 4 now but declining wouldn't help either because White just wins the rook (and forces mate in 8 according to Fritz but of course I didn't see that).
1024,36,30,2Rxc2+,b'6k1/pp2ppb1/3p2p1/3P3P/7P/P3QP2/1qrK2R1/7R w - -',I didn't see the forced mate in 4 (25...Rxc2+ 26.Kd3 Qb3+ 27.Ke4 Qa4+ 28.Kd3 Qc4#) but what I did see was that I could reach a won ending with 25...Rxc2+ 26.Kd3 Qb3+ 27.Ke4 Qxe3+ 28.Kxe3 Rxg2 And I'm a piece and a pawn up. I don't know what Wite saw but he resigned and I won the game. I was very proud of this win over a higher rated opponent!
1025,37,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Alekhine's defense. I'm always weary playing against it because I have the habit of over extending my pawns just as black hopes.
1026,37,1,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I must admit I did contemplate transposing out of this opening with Nc3 but at some point I must learn
1027,37,2,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Most times I play c4 here but i'm trying to play it at least a little bit more conservatively
1028,37,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Again I struggled against playing against c4. I'm a bit too aggressive and I'm attempting to learn to play positionally. So I avoided the c4 and f4 line
1029,37,4,c4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/3pp3/3nP3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq c3',All book moves. I contemplated playing perhaps h3 here to relieve the pin but I'd rather force the knight away for now
1030,37,5,Bxf3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1n1pp3/4P3/2PP4/2N1Bb2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I'm unaware to how the line is supposed to be played out. Capturing on f3 seems like it was too soon perhaps Nc6 would have been better. The bishop pair side by side seems to be more formidable than having the knight on f3
1031,37,6,Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nnpp3/4P3/2PP4/2N1BB2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',His only move really to prevent Bxb7. Although now I realize at some point that if the position calls for I can play Bxc6 and double black's pawns but I'd rather stagger his position more before trading a bishop for a knight
1032,37,7,dxe5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn1p3/4p3/2PP4/2N1BB2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I'm not really sure how good of a trade this is for black. Maybe Qd7 would better and allow him to attempt to control the d file? I dunno.

1034,37,9,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/p1pnbppp/2p1p3/4P3/2P5/2N1B3/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',It's as if black wants me to control the d file. although the b file should be attacked more fully by black
1035,37,10,1f4,b'r1q2rk1/p1pnbppp/2p1p3/4P3/2P2P2/2N1B3/PP2Q1PP/R2R2K1 b - f3',Black seems so confined here. His pieces tend to point more queenside than kingside so I was considering a kingside pawn storm later if black allowed
1036,37,11,1Bc5,b'r1q2rk1/p1pn1ppp/2p1p3/2b1P3/2P2P2/2N1B3/PP2Q1PP/R2R2K1 w - -',The doubled pawns of black's just seems to making his position so tough and cramped. I don't like this move by black at all I'm unsure of a better move though. 
1037,37,12,1Ne4,b'r1q2rk1/pnp2ppp/2p1p3/4P3/1PP1NP2/8/P3Q1PP/R2R2K1 b - -',Black is in an even worse position than he was before. He is even more cramped behind his lines and now my knight is sitting quite wondrously on e4

1042,37,17,2Rd8,b'r1qr2k1/1np2pp1/4p2p/1Pp1P3/P3NP2/8/2Q3PP/R2R2K1 w - -',Here comes his attempt at opening the d file

1069,39,8,Bd7,b'r4rk1/pp1bbpp1/3qpn1p/4N3/3P4/P1PB4/4QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I don't normally invite my opponent to swap N for B but in this case his N was far better than my B and if he didn't swap I had plans for the B.  Regardless I had to develop.
1070,39,9,1g4,b'r4rk1/pp1bbpp1/3qpn1p/4N3/3P2P1/P1PB4/4QP1P/R1B2RK1 b - g3',?! An unexpected and rash-looking advance opening up White's king more than Black's.  I'm quite fond of a similar advance (at an earlier stage) in the Caro Kann Advance though.

1075,39,14,1Bf4,b'5rk1/pp2bppn/2rqp2p/8/3P1BP1/P1PB1Q2/5P1P/R4RK1 b - -',For some reason I hadn't predicted this response.
1076,39,15,1Ng5,b'5rk1/pp2bpp1/2rqp2p/6n1/3P1BP1/P1PB1Q2/5P1P/R4RK1 w - -',and I suspect neither had White expected this response to the threat on my Q though it is the logical follow up to Black's last move..
