108,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I am playing in a MT in memory of the victims of the Japanese Earthquake.  Both the above players are my current opponents.  I saw that my buddy Jim had lost his Master status and found that he had sadly lost a game to a Class B player called Delta38.  It shows that amateurs CAN BEAT Masters and as I am currently playing a huge crop of Masters and a Grandmaster I will play through this game to show myself how it can be done.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15498364&fb=1&rnd=0.41857366360436593.  Jim starts off with 1. e4 and Delta gives him the French Defense with e6."
109,5,1,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. b3 - a little offbeat but prepares to fianchetto his dsb onto b2.
110,5,2,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/4P3/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ..... b6 - Delta returns the compliment.
111,5,3,e5,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3pP3/8/1PNP4/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',6. e5 - this pawn wedge on e5 is quite a common feature of the French Defense.
112,5,4,c5,b'rn1qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/1p2p3/2ppP3/8/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq c6',7. ..... c5 - GM Daniel King in a chess video on the French has always recommended this black pawn break on c5 before black's queen knight goes to c6.
113,5,5,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/ppn1p3/1NppP3/8/1P1P1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',9. ..... a6 - Delta does not wish Jim's knight to get too comfortable on b5.
114,5,6,b5,b'r2qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/p1n1p3/1pppP3/8/NP1P1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',10. .... b5 - suddenly a nice neat pawn wall on the queenside.
115,5,7,1Bc1,b'r2qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/p1n1p3/1pp1P3/8/NPpP1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',13. Bc1 - wow and double wow black wins a pawn here because if Bxc3 then we have an example of a PAWN FORK on b4.  Either Jim's knight or his bishop will have to go.  Now that pawn on c3 could become very awkward indeed for Jim.
116,5,8,1Ndxe5,b'r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p1n1p3/1pp1n3/8/NPpP1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',13. .... Ndxe5 - and so the carnage goes on.  Another white pawn drops off and suddenly black is TWO pawns to the good.  Unlike me Delta bravely keeps his mits off the Offer Draw button - mind you - I think I will now if I had that position avoid offering my opponent a draw now I have that little handful of Expert Draws in my profile I am prepared to up the ante!
117,5,9,1Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p1n1p3/1pp5/8/1PpP1B2/P1N2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',15. Bxf3 - now with plus material black is eager to trade white down into an inferior endgame.

119,5,11,1Nc4,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/p1n1p3/2p5/PpN5/1PpP1B2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',18. Nc4 - Jim tries to break free of it but will it last?
120,5,12,Qxb7,b'r3k2r/1q2bppp/p3p3/2p5/PpNn4/1PpP4/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',19. ..... Qxb7 - now more wood disappears from the board - white's chances of counterplay are being reduced further.
121,5,13,O-O,b'r4rk1/1q2bppp/p3p3/2p5/PpNn1B2/1PpP4/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',20. .... 0-0 - black finally castles on move 20 so his rooks are now connected and can pile on more pressure on the white position.
122,5,14,c2,b'r4rk1/1q2bppp/p3p3/2p5/PpNn4/1P1PB3/2p2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',21..... c2 - that pawn advances but is this premature?  That pawn is just one square from promotion (if I was the black player it would have been called Glendadom).
123,5,15,2Qh5,b'r4rk1/1q2bppp/p3p3/2p4Q/PpNn4/1P1PB3/2p2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',22. Qh5 - Jim puts his queen to an aggressive square but will it do him any good?  No - because look at the b3 pawn - that one too is just gonna drop!
124,5,16,b3,b'r4rk1/1q2bppp/p3p3/2p4Q/P1NB4/1p1P4/R1p2PPP/5RK1 w - -',24. ..... b3! - a beautiful in between move.  White must move his rook and then Jim's dsb is picked off next move and black has two connected passed pawns just soooo close to promotion.
125,5,17,Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/1q2bppp/p3p3/8/P1Np2Q1/1p1P4/1Rp2PPP/5RK1 w - -',26...... Rfc8 - I have a feeling black is prepared to sac one of his rooks for that knight on c4 which is holding white's queenside together and preventing those pawns from crowning.
126,5,18,2gxf3,b'r1r3k1/4bppp/p3p3/8/P1Np4/1p1P1P2/1Rp2P1P/5RK1 b - -',28. gxf3 - this queen trade has worsened Jim's position still further.  His kingside pawn structure is shattered.
127,5,19,2Rab8,b'1rr3k1/4bppp/p3p3/8/P1Np4/1p1P1P2/1Rp2P1P/5RK1 w - -',28. ..... Rab8 - awesome -- this rook backs up the b3 pawn and black has just kept that pressure on.
128,5,20,Rxc4,b'1r4k1/4bppp/p3p3/8/P1rp4/1p1P1P2/1Rp2P1P/R5K1 w - -',29. ...... Rxc4 - as predicted.
129,5,21,d3,b'1r4k1/4bppp/p3p3/8/P1P5/1p1p1P2/1Rp2P1P/R5K1 w - -',30. ..... d3 - Jim accepts the sacrifice and Delta pushes his d pawn to d3 where it backs up the b2 pawn.  I think that next up is Ba3 and if Rxa3 then c1/Q+ comes next.  The rook on b2 will be trapped so Jim resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material and Old Matey will not be too far away.  This is an absolutely awesome result for Delta because Jim Friar is a very strong player and here are my past game stats against him - past games against therealjimfriar (won/lost/drawn): 0 (0%) / 7 (87%) / 1 (12%).  Yup I think the Master Mater will be certainly quaking in his hiking boots if he ever comes across a Delta!  Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

409,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Easily the best first move for white though some people prefer the dubious 1. d4?.
410,17,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',An unorthodox move for white. I did this to throw off my opponent since he probably knows the sicilian better than I do. As we'll see my suspicions were correct and once we leave the main-line sicilian this guy has no idea what to do. Classic sign of a guy who memorizes openings but doesn't actually know how to play them.

420,17,11,axb3,b'7r/3k2pp/4pp2/8/1r6/1p1P4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Gave my rook free reign on the a-file and a clear route to the 7th rank.

501,21,33,Qh4,b'3kn3/1b4pp/pp1p4/3p2PP/PP1PpB1q/4P3/1KR1BP2/2R5 w - -',I am now feeling certain that Capa is expecting a draw in this game. He is telling Khan to offer a draw which he is ready to accept. An ex-World champion and a legend offering a draw and who can refuse? 40 moves completed now and probably Capa wanted to catch up with the clock.
502,21,34,4Ka3,b'3kn3/1b4pp/pp1p4/3p2PP/PP1PpB1q/K3P3/2R1BP2/2R5 b - -',I think Khan does not know Chess etiquette and he continues his attack on the queen side.

510,21,42,5Qh3,b'3kn3/1b5p/1p1p2pP/pP1p2P1/P2PpB2/4P2q/1KR1BP2/2R5 w - -',Capa is too good to fall for such poisoned pawns. This is positional understanding at a high level. Now look at the paralysis which Capa is undergoing. His minor pieces are defending the entry points on the c-file and cannot move. His only active piece is his queen which cannot do much on the king side. Here I can feel that Khan must be chuckling away inside and plotting an entry on the queen side. Can he crash in? Any sacrifice in the offing?

I was trying to make something of the hanging white's lsb but it was impossible. And in the process (remember it is a blitz and I had few time left) I didn't see his knight...
644,27,14,2Rxg8,b'2kr2R1/pp3p2/2p1p3/4n3/8/2Pb2N1/PP4PP/R1BB2K1 b - -',But incredibly enough he didn't either!

651,27,21,Ra5,b'2k5/p4p2/1pp1pBb1/r7/1nP5/1P3BN1/P5PP/3R2K1 w - -',At least a3 is covered. 
652,27,22,3Bc3,b'2k5/p4p2/1pp1p1b1/r7/1nP5/1PB2BN1/P5PP/3R2K1 b - -',Another exchange but this one is half-good for me. I would have gone for another piece coming in but it must be said that he is really weak on a2 and will lose it. Be4 to contest my bishop's action is one move too far to play Rd2 controlling everything. Rd8+ leads nowhere if the Knight defends c6... so incredibily enough I have a game for some moves. And his best try is by losing the bishop pair. 
653,27,23,cxb4,b'2k5/p4p2/1p2p1b1/r7/1pP5/1P3BN1/P5PP/3R2K1 w - -',I saved the c6 pawn even if it is doubled.

655,27,25,fxg6,b'2k5/p7/1p2p1p1/8/1pP5/1P4N1/r5PP/3R2K1 w - -',it will take some more moves for the knight to become dangerous.

659,27,29,Kxb6,b'8/8/1k2p1p1/8/rp2N3/1R6/6PP/6K1 w - -',Incredibly enough the knight cannot attack easily my pawns. 
660,27,30,4Nc3+,b'8/8/4p1p1/1k6/rp6/1RN5/5KPP/8 b - -',Nd2 would have completely blockaded me. By exchanging rooks I have some chances. 
661,27,31,Kc4,b'8/8/4p1p1/2N5/1pk5/8/5KPP/8 w - -',if Nxe6 my b pawn cannot be stopped.
662,27,32,4Ke2,b'8/8/4p1p1/8/N1k5/1p6/4K1PP/8 b - -',Now if I can distract him and keep my king not too far from his pawns I can have a chance. 
663,27,33,4Nd3,b'8/8/4p1p1/8/8/1pkN4/4K1PP/8 b - -',If I win the knight he will reach my pawns first. 
664,27,34,4Kd4,b'8/8/4p1p1/8/3k4/1p1N4/4K1PP/8 w - -',Keeping him tied to the b3 pawn. 
665,27,35,e5,b'8/8/6p1/4p3/3k4/1p1N2P1/4K2P/8 w - -',He cannot take it. 
666,27,36,e3,b'8/8/6p1/8/3k3P/1p2p1P1/1N2K3/8 w - -',Now it becomes interesting. He is tied to either pawns and while he takes them my king will take his.
667,27,37,5g4,b'8/8/6p1/8/3k2PP/1p2p3/1N2K3/8 b - -',I think that this is a big mistake. It makes his pawns weak from f4. But what else?

671,28,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I chose to respond with the Sicilian which isn't something I have not played much of at all! I have only just started looking into it and thought I would give it a shot here.
672,28,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',It's with this move the accelerated grand prix attack that I realised where the game was heading.
673,28,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',This is known to be the best reply for black. The Tal gambit I think it's called.
674,28,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Since the queen can't escape the only way to save it would be the passive Be2. I knew already however that Be2 wasn't going to happen.

678,28,8,h5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1p1/2k5/2p3Np/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ h6',?! Now this is new! as far as I know this is the first time this has been used in these lines of the game or rather the first I have seen of this move being used. The move looked very good at the time with my analysis and infact it worked extraordinarily well in this particular game. I would have given this move a ! except the master easy19 has challenged me to a game to show me how white ought to play this position. I'm afraid to say this oh so fabulous move of mine wasn't so great after all. The idea behind it was to win tempo when white retreats the bishop the if the night is on e6 black can look to develop his rook to h6 in an effort to exchange the rook for the two active white pieces which could not afford to let happen. As you will see from this game the move can be very effective but only if your opponent makes the wrong moves.

681,28,11,Na6,b'r4b1r/pp2p1p1/n1kqN3/2p4p/4pP2/7B/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',It was a toss up here between this move and Rh6. although moving Rh6 straight away losses a piece it isn't actually that bad a move. after Rh6 then Nxf8 Na6! then white needs to save the knight Ne6 and black responds Nb4! and although material is back to even black has made up for it by having an easier time developing and has decent piece coordination and activity. The text move is just as good however as is a little less simple.

It looks to protect the c2 square and have control over c4 and the currently unimportant b5. The move I expected most was Nc3 where black has the option of either Rh6! or Nb4! however I realised when looking into the game that if Nc3 I could play Rh6! and not actually have to worry about Nxe4?? because black can just play Rxe6! and whites knight is pinned to the king so wouldn't be able to attack my queen at all.

White can not afford to lose tempo in this opening and although this move threatens Bxe4+ it is a severe wast of time because of my reply.

I know one of whites goals in this opening is to trade knights for bishops but there are exceptions because this not only is a bad trade for those reasons but Black also gets to develop his rook onto the nice semiopen f file.

The knight is stuck on the irrelevant queen side with no squares available for it the DSB and a1 rook are yet to even enter the game the LSB is doing nothing and the f1 rook is only serving as a weakness. Black on the other hand has something of an attack going and even the knight which is way on the queenside still has the b4 square open to him if he wants it.

Possible progress could have been:
18.f4-Rc7 19.fxe5-dxe5. The fact that you give away an open line for whites d pawn is not really a problem. The pawn is weak and white doesn't have the black squared bishop to provide back-up for promotion. Whereas black does have that back-up for his pawn on the e-line

943,38,28,2Rg7,b'r1b1n2k/ppp3r1/3p2q1/4n3/3NP2p/2P2P2/PP2BQ1B/R4RNK w - -',No i am not losing a time; i am avoiding the powerful Qxh4 (or Qh4 in case i play h3) and check followed by exchange or loss of hpawn
944,38,29,2Rad1,b'r1b1n2k/ppp3r1/3p2q1/4n3/3NP2p/2P2P2/PP2BQ1B/3R1RNK b - -',not sure this move was useful but white is on a passive zugzwang on king side

950,38,35,3Bxf5,b'r3n2k/ppp3r1/8/4pb2/4P3/2P2P2/PP2B2K/5RN1 w - -',doubling the enemy pawns and installing the knight + liberating the second rook; i think this is an excellent move
951,38,36,Kg8,b'r5k1/ppp3r1/5n2/4pP2/8/2P2P1N/PP2B2K/5R2 w - -',the white king has to be liberated because the black king is going to the center and threatening Rh8 if able to pass on seventh line 
952,38,37,Ke7,b'r7/ppp1k1r1/5n2/4pP2/2B5/2P2P1N/PP5K/3R4 w - -',seventh line... threatening directly the king and forcing the rooks exchange
953,38,38,3Rg1,b'r7/ppp1k1r1/5n2/4pP2/2B5/2P2P1N/PP5K/6R1 b - -',here we are
954,38,39,Rd8,b'3r4/ppp1k3/5n2/4pP2/2B5/2P2P1N/PP6/6K1 w - -',threatening Rd1 or Rd2

956,38,41,Rd2,b'8/pp2k3/2p2n2/4pP2/8/1BP2P2/PP1r1N2/6K1 w - -',here i anticipated Nd1 followed by Nd7-Nc5 threatening the bishop but also Kf6 and white is soon in a new zugzwang
957,38,42,4Nd3,b'8/pp2k3/2p2n2/4pP2/8/1BPN1P2/PP1r4/6K1 b - -',probable dismotivation mistake
958,38,43,4Rxd3,b'8/pp2k3/2p2n2/4pP2/8/1BPr1P2/PP6/6K1 w - -',and resigned...
959,39,0,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Damiano defense is always going to be an EPIC FAIL.

961,39,2,Qh5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Either forcing to move his king out then i would  checkmate him soon. 
962,39,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/6p1/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Probably the best move if you didn't want to get checkmated.

964,39,5,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1Q/ppppq2p/5np1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq -',apturing my pawn with his queen would be a better move.
965,39,6,d3,b'rnb1kb1Q/ppppq2p/5np1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQq -',I just realised my queen is trapped!
966,39,7,Qg7,b'rnb1kb1Q/pppp2qp/5np1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq -',But If he tried attacking it with a minor piece i might've already rescued it. He could moved his g pawn then maneuvered the queenside knight to g6
967,39,8,Qxg7,b'rnb1kb2/pppp2Qp/5np1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQq -',He offered me his queen so i capture it

971,39,12,4f4,b'8/7p/3p2p1/k2P4/2b1PP2/2P3KP/2P3P1/3R4 b - -',He resigns Because of material count. I find it extremely hard to believe that he had only captured 1 pawn while i have captured 5 I pick off his pawns one by one then exchange my rook for bishop and then it would be an easy win for me.
