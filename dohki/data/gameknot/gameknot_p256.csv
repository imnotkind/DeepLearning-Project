0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone me again this is another Latvian game played by my mentor Ion which he also e-mailed to me.  In this game Ion inflicts a spectacular stranglehold on his opponent with the move 16 ............... e2!!  White eventually resigns way behind on material.
1,0,1,Rf1,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4N3/2BPp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 b Qkq -',6.  Rf1 - the first five moves have followed my own game against Ion but instead of the check on h5 white decides to move his rook.  This move has an inferior percentage in the GK databases.
2,0,2,d5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/2BPp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 w Qkq d6',6. ..................d5 - this pawn sac opens up a line for black's lsb to come to h3 which it does 3 moves later.
3,0,3,Bf7+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2Bpp/5n2/4N3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 b Qkq -',8. Bf7 ?! - I think white would have been better served by playing Nc3 or Be3 here and getting on with his development.  What do you the jury think?
4,0,4,Ke7,b'rnb2b1r/ppp1kBpp/5n2/4N3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 w Q -',"8. ...................Ke7 - Ion stated that ""I had a strong feeling this would be the right square for the King keeping the LSB bishop free rather than the DSB but also avoiding a knight fork on f7"".  Agreed - although Ion cannot castle it may not be a problem due to white's retarded development which Ion takes full advantage of over the next few moves."
5,0,5,Bh5,b'rnb2b1r/ppp1k1pp/5n2/4N2B/3Pp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 b Q -',9.  Bh5 - I think this is necessary to retreat the bishop in order to defend the rook on f1 but white has got further and further behind in development to do this.
6,0,6,Kxd7,b'r4b1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3Pp3/7b/PPP1BPqP/RNBQKR2 w Q -',"11. ................ Kxd7 - Ion stated that ""I wanted to keep the knight handy to the action. Now it all goes very pear shaped for White..."""
7,0,7,Qxh2,b'r4b1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3Pp3/5P1b/PPP1B2q/RNBQKR2 w Q -',12. .............. Qxh2 - the h pawn drops.
8,0,8,1Bf1,b'r4b1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3Pp3/5P1b/PPP2R2/RNBQKBq1 b Q -',"14. Bf1 - Ion stated  ""How ignominious: the bishop has spent 5 moves to fetch up whence he began!""

What about 14. Ke2 or Kd2 instead of blocking the check with the bishop?"
9,0,9,1Re8,b'4rb1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3Pp3/5P1b/PPP2R2/RNBQKBq1 w Q -',14. ..................... Re8! Strong move threatening a deadly discovery on the e file.  Note the black king can castle by hand by moving to c8 if he wants to!
10,0,10,1Rf3,b'4rb1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3P1P2/4pR1b/PPP5/RNBQKBq1 b Q -',16. Rf3 - black could play Bg4 winning the exchange here but he has got something stronger up his sleeve such as ........
11,0,11,1e2,b'4rb1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3P1P2/5R1b/PPP1p3/RNBQKBq1 w Q -',"16. .................... e2 - Ion stated ""What a picture!""  I agree and this is the stranglehold!"
12,0,12,1Qxe2,b'4rb1r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/3P1P2/5R1b/PPP1Q3/RNB1KBq1 b Q -',17. Qxe2 - as a result the queen plops!
13,0,13,1c3,b'4r2r/pppk2pp/5n2/8/1b1P1P2/2P2R1b/PP2Q3/RNB1KBq1 b Q -',18. Bd2 also blocks the check and develops a piece.
14,0,14,2Kd2,b'4r3/pppk2pp/5n2/8/1b1P1P2/2P5/PP1K4/RNB2Rq1 b - -',21. Kd2 - the king is deflected away from the rook on f1 by the black rook check at e8 now the white rook falls.
15,0,15,Re2+,b'8/pppk2pp/5n2/8/1b1P1P2/2P5/PPK1r3/RNB2q2 w - -',22. ............. Re2  - now the rook thunders down the e file giving a devastating check on e2 which will deflect the white king away from the c1 bishop.  Now that piece falls and .......
16,0,16,Qxc1,b'8/pppk2pp/5n2/8/1b1P1P2/1KP5/PP2r3/RNq5 w - -',23................ Qxc1 - white resigns.  He is 12 points down in material and although white can win back his bishop next move with Kxb4 he will still be 8 points down in material and Old Matey is not too far away I think.  Well played Ion.
17,1,0,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is likely way too early to bring out the queen.  The queen is the strongest attacking piece but ironically can't withstand attack.  She's so powerful that she's instantly a target.
18,1,1,Qc6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"...and now things go from bad to worse with
3. ... Qc6??  better is
3. ... Qa5"
19,1,2,Bb5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/1B6/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I typically try to annotate where the strategic scales have reached the tipping point since the tactical picture at that point usually does not show things as bad as they really are.  The lesson there being that once the tactics show that you're in trouble you've already long lost the strategic battle.
20,1,3,Bxc6,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/2b5/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',However in this game White's material advantage is so extreme that the battle is over before it's really begun.  With such a huge surplus of material White's obvious winning strategy is to trade down to an endgame--which is exactly what he does.
21,1,4,2Qxd5,b'4bk2/pp3ppp/8/3Q4/8/8/PPP2PPP/6K1 b - -',To further illustrate the correctness of White's trading down strategy note the drastic disparity between White's capabilities and Black's.  Yet White is only up by 1 more pawn than he was after his fifth move.  This is because material advantages become amplified as the population of the board dwindles.  A 1 pawn lead is more meaningful when that's all you have left than at the beginning of the game when you have plenty.

White still eneds to use multiple pieces to protect the d pawn so the entire center does not crumble under black's attack."

67,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone this game is about two sides attacking one another.  The moral here though is that the side with the greater amount of forces in the enemy camp will work effectively together as a team and force checkmate whereas if you only have one piece in the enemy camp and your other pieces are stuck at home then as you will see God help you!
68,4,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',2. ................ f5 - this is the Latvian Gambit this is a very wild opening but I thought I would try something different.  I thought that rather than sit back and allow my Expert opponent to dominate in the way he did in our last few matches I would try a more aggressive approach.  It made the game a little more interesting but unfortunately I still got the same result - the blob!
69,4,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bc4 - also commonly played is Nxe5.
70,4,3,Qg5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4N1q1/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4. ................ Qg5? - this move is a bad move.  I played this because the Poisoned Pawn Variation is a recognised spur of the Latvian and it did have a good win percentage in the Expert's database but not so in the Gameknot database.  The drawback to this variation is as you will see Glenda and Henry will be the only pieces to move in the entire game!
71,4,4,Qxc1,b'rnbk1bnr/pppp3p/6B1/4N2Q/3Pp3/8/PPP1KP1P/RNq5 w - -',"9. .............. Qxc1 -  c6 is also played here but there is a brilliant refutation.  I will give you the game Atars v Tomson in a correspondence theme tournament in 1973 taken from chessgames.com as follows:-

1. e4 e5 
2. Nf3 f5 
3. Bc4 fxe4

72,4,5,Qxc2+,b'rnb2bn1/ppppkN2/6Q1/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPq1KP1P/R7 w - -',"14. ...............Qxc2  - the queen escapes with check but cannot get back to the right sector of the board.  I still have had no chance to develop my other pieces.

The rook in the corner cannot be taken as 14 ............ Qxa1 allows a spectacular mate viz:-

75,4,8,Kxd5,b'rnb2b2/ppp2N2/3p4/3k4/3P2Q1/4P3/P6q/2R1K3 w - -',21. ............. Kxd5 - I leave the database behind here and try to cut down white's army even more but alas Ion has still enough pieces available to force checkmate.
76,4,9,2Qxc8+,b'rnQ1kb2/pp6/3p4/6N1/3P4/4P3/P6q/2R1K3 b - -',"Here I threw in the sponge on the grounds of unavoidable mate due to:-

So it is not always a material advantage that wins a game it can be a greater concentration of forces that work well together around the enemy king that can effect a checkmate.  Hope this makes sense.  Hereby ends the lesson.

Also after the exchange I would have had one knight out as opposed to his having an exposed queen out.

Also doubled c file pawns is not that bad as they can exert influence on d5 and help with the eventual pawn break. Perhaps he was hoping to take out e4 for an easy kill.

Black moves his king away fearing my knight would check him but I had no desire to do that without proper co-ordination from the other forces which were still in the preparatory stages for the attack. So he wasted his move I think losing more initiative.

I overlooked BC3 a mistake. If I had seen that I would have probably done bxa5 then played the rooks on the open file. At this point it seemed limiting blacks queen further and gaining space on the queen side then taking the white bishop would be a good move.

231,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone just found this game scrawled on a piece of A4 paper.  It was an old OTB game played nine years ago.  I played a young 18 year old upper 6th form student in a best of 3 friendlies at my local Cambridge City Chess Club that night called Patrick Scott who had a BCF rating of 184 - I have translated this into ELO as above.  I went down 2.5 - 0.5 overall but here is how the half point transpired.  It was the last of the 3 games and in fact my last ever game with him as the following week he moved away from Cambridge to digs near his prospective university.  This is the only time in my whole chess career that I have managed to draw any match of any description against an Expert.
232,12,1,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nd2 - this is the Tarrasch Defense of the French Defense.  I used to play the French Defense as black a lot in tournaments and in some friendlies such as this one.  This knight move although it blocks in the white dsb does support the pawn on e4.
233,12,2,dxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/4P3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',5. ................... dxe4 - oh oh this knight exchange weakens my pawn structure.

235,12,4,b6,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/1pn1p3/2p1P3/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP2NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',8. ............. b6 - bolsters my c pawn and prepares Bb7.

237,12,6,a5,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/2n1p3/p2qP3/Pp1Pp3/1P2B3/4NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq a6',14. ................a5 - an expansion on the queenside but will it get me anywhere?

Over the last few moves my pawn roll on the kingside (I was sure white was going to have to castle there) has one big drawback - it has weakened my king's position and I will now have to give up castling rights with the queens on the board.
239,12,8,1Qh5+,b'r2q1b1r/1b3k1p/2n1pN2/pB2PppQ/Pp1Pp3/1P2B3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',19. Qh5 ! - The Wicked Witch of the West now comes on the scene straight on to h5.  It seems I will pay a very high price for opening up the Fool's Mate diagonal.

Only now do I look at the material count and note that I am 2 pawns to the bad against a player with an 800  rating differential.  I do look at the white backward b pawn however and the seed of a plan which will germinate over the next few moves is sown.
245,12,14,2Ng3,b'r4b1r/2k4p/2b1p3/p3PpB1/Pp1P4/1P4N1/5PPP/2R1K2R b K -',28. Ng3 - knight sidesteps the f pawn's attack.  I must now release Frere Leblanc from that pin.

Bd5 - after white connects his rooks with Kf2 I now unleash my counter-attack - Frere Leblanc puts the b3 pawn under the hammer.  As white has a dsb one of his rooks or his king is going to be tied down to defending it!
248,12,17,Rxg7,b'r7/1k4rp/4p3/p2bPpB1/Pp1P4/1P3P2/5KPP/2R4R w - -',32. ............ Rxg7 - white decides to simplify further by eliminating the bishop pair.  Note that we are now left with opposite coloured bishops which if the rooks were swapped off might offer drawing chances to the defending side.
249,12,18,Rac8,b'2r3r1/1k5p/4pB2/p2bPp2/Pp1P4/1P3P2/5KPP/1R5R w - -',34. ................ Rac8 - my rooks take advantage of the open files available to them.  I think I have some play for my 2 pawn deficit.
250,12,19,Rc3,b'6r1/1k5p/4pB2/p2bPp2/Pp1P4/1Pr2P2/1R3KPP/7R w - -',35. ............. Rc3 - putting more pressure on that weak b pawn!

Rd3? - I think I actually missed a chance to win the game here I think Rc2  would have probably prompted a white flag.  After the exchange of rooks on c2 how on earth is white going to adequately defend his b pawn.  The a pawn will most likely drop off giving me two fantastic passers on the a and b file.
252,12,21,Be8,b'4b3/1k5p/4p1r1/p1B1Pp2/Pp1P3K/1Pr2P2/1R4PP/1R6 w - -',42. ................... Be6 - over the last few moves white has tried to force a win by marching his king up the h file.  I think his king wants my h pawn.  Over my dead body!
253,12,22,Be8,b'4b1r1/1k5p/4p3/p1B1Pp2/Pp1P4/1Pr2P1K/1R4PP/5R2 w - -',47. ............. Be6 - things are drifting along rather aimlessly now.  I think I may draw this but it is in the hands of my opponent.
254,12,23,5Rxc2,b'6r1/1k5p/2b1p3/p1B1Pp2/Pp1P4/1P3P1K/2R3PP/8 b - -',50. Rxc2 - one pair of rooks have been exchanged.  I now tie his remaining rook down to defending that b pawn.
255,12,24,5Rb2,b'6r1/1k5p/4p3/p1BbPp2/Pp1P4/1P3P1K/1R4PP/8 b - -',55. Rb2 - finally after more aimless play Patrick offers me a draw and I wasted no time in accepting it.  Boy I was over the moon!
256,13,0,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Nxd4 is more common however the Qxd4 is not a bad move. According to the GameKnot game database both have the same win percentage although the knight take is played 40 times as much.
257,13,1,Qc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2Q1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is a bad position for the queen to be moved to.  It allows black to develop his WSB and forces the queen to be moved again.  One of the goals of an opening is to develop your pieces without moving the same one multiple times.  Here the queen has already moved twice and will be forced to move a third.  White would have been better with Bb5 both developing another piece and pinning the knight.
258,13,2,c4,b'r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p1npb3/8/Q1P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq c3',Here white prevents the b5 move which will again force white to move the queen.
259,13,3,Qxa5,b'r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1npb3/Q7/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',White sees the opportunity to exchange queens which he takes.  However a better move might have been Nc3.  This gives black the option of exchanging the queens however the advantage to white will be the placement of the knight as he will be able to develop another piece and prevent black from gaining the double attack on the c pawn with Nxa5 at the end of the queen exchange.
260,13,4,1Nc3,b'r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1npb3/8/2P1P3/1PN2N2/P4PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',With Nc3 white allows black to place his knight on b4 which will become a major headache.  White would have been better with a3 which protects this square and still allows Nc3 on whites next move.  
261,13,5,1Nd4,b'r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p2pb3/8/1nPNP3/1PN5/P4PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',White wishes to keep his opportunity to castle so Nd4 is the only real option to prevent the king rook fork on c2.  However it will be difficult for white to protect these pieces if black is able to get his bishop to g7.
262,13,6,Bg7,b'r3k1nr/1p2ppbp/p2pb1p1/8/1nPNP3/1P6/P3NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',With this move white is seeing great pressure on the diagonal and the knight has a number of strong combinations.
263,13,7,1Ba3,b'r3k1nr/1p2ppbp/p2pb1p1/8/1nPNP3/BP6/P3NPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I am hard pressed to find a good move for white in this position.  Ba3 plays badly (as do any other BSB move) as we will see.  a3 results with ND3  Ke2 then NXf2.  White must leave his knights where they are.  g3 might be an option but we will have the results as with the bishop move.

1.  0-0 which places his king in a strong position and allows him to bring both rooks to attach the open queen side.  

2.  Ng4 with an attempt to place his knight on e3.  This will bring even more pressure on the white king and rooks.  

3.  Bg4 which could force a bishop trade.  White can move his bishop to prevent the trade but I think the black position would be stronger than with the g5 move."

Nf3 Black can run into some problems; if Black trades he will allow White to develop his Knight.  Also e6 is now dangerously weak.

Especially with the last point it is regrettable that neither of your Bishops can move without giving up pawns.  So I would probably have recommended Kg7 Rfe8 or b5 before Rfc8.  After all with a defended White pawn in the c file where can your Rook go?

With so many pieces gone King activity becomes an important marker of progress and a King wedged into the h file is a liability and blocks your h pawn.

With Bd3 you have fighting chances at wedging the Bishop in front of one pawn and holding the line that way freeing your Rook for bigger and better things.
339,16,22,Ra7,b'8/r6p/7k/1P4p1/P7/7P/2b3P1/R5K1 w - -',?  Again I think moving the King is important here.  Ra7 doesn't seem to accomplish much.  The same is true with several of the coming moves; rather than stopping White's advance they gradually give critical space and cause Black trouble.

342,16,25,4Kf2,b'1r6/1P5p/P6k/6p1/4b3/7P/5KP1/R7 b - -',??  a7 and White gets a Queen or at least goes up the exchange after 42. a7 Rxb7 43. a8=Q Rb1  44. Rxb1 Bxa8.
343,16,26,Rxb7,b'8/1r5p/7k/6p1/8/7P/5KP1/R7 w - -',I think from here the position ought to be a draw.
344,16,27,5gxh5,b'8/7k/R7/6pP/1r6/7P/7K/8 b - -',?  What chances White may have had went away here.  A pawn in the h file is not to impossible to rown if the enemy King stands between it and the crowning square given otherwise equal material.  More pawns in the h file makes little difference.
345,16,28,Kg7,b'8/6k1/R7/6pP/7r/6KP/8/8 w - -',?  Why not Rxh5?
346,16,29,Rxh5,b'8/7k/6RP/7r/8/5K2/8/8 w - -',Of course if your opponent hasn't recognized yet that it must be a draw then vacuuming up the pawns is a good way to force it. =)  You got in some hot water by being down all of those passed pawns and again by letting them advance so far but generally you played well.  Just watch for traps (like 25. ... Bh5!) and try to find general principles about Rook placement and pawn maneuvering that will give you more consistent play.  After all you've been in the 1500s before and for good reason.

As I recently played the Latvian against Ion who kindly e-mailed me the following game I thought it was worth annotating because Ion handled this opening very well and took full advantage of his opponent's innacuracies.

On the surface this move looks a little questionable as it is pretty early for a queen move and blocks development of the dark squared bishop.  However the story behind this move is kind of interesting.  In the previous game between us I while doing opening study using the GameKnot database stumbled across a game itking had lost to another player after being forced to move his bishop off of the h7-b1 diagonal to retake a rook on move 24.  Looking at the game I realized that the other available move would allow a winning exchange sacrifice.  So I played the game for that line made the exchange sacrifice and won.  Itking must have realized that I had seen that game so this time he took an early opportunity of getting away from any database lines.

This move is a good choice because: 1) it stops any ideas of minority attack on the queenside (a major strategic plan in Exchange variation) 2) in unlikely event White castles on the queenside the attack is already on the way (11.0-0-0 Na6! and Black has a slight edge) 3) it gives Black an option to play Na6 without fear of Ba6 (with doubled isolated pawns on a file) *** It turned out I was correct - this move is not recorded in my databases at all I only found 10...Ne4 and 10...b6 (with the same idea of allowing Na6 -> Nc7 without fear of Ba6).

So I decided to postpone publishing the annotation until the relevant game is finished. In that game miljac played 13.Na4 which after 13...Ne6; 14.Rac1 b5 eventually ended in a 58-move draw.

Both players have executed their respective plans and now it is time to evaluate the results. *** At the first glance White's pawn center together with the open f file looks really threatening but a closer look reveals that it is in fact very vulnerable to pressure. The Knight on e2 is misplaced and should ideally be on f3 where it has greater control of the center and does not block e file for the Rooks. Another problem is that (if White advances the e pawn) the center might get permanently blockaded and later turned into a liability requiring constant defense. Objective assessment of the position (verified by analysis) is surprising - Black has slight advantage if he plays accurately!

The idea is to maximize pressure on the pawn center before forcing things with future Ne6.

It is worth noting that 16.d5 is tempting but I correctly calculated that it doesn't give any advantage after 16...Ng6 (even 16...cd5!?; 17.Bb5 Qc7 is playable). This is probably the reason White played 16.Nf4. --- lighttotheright suggested 16.h3 which after correct 16...Be2; 17.Be2 Ne6 also results in a small advantage for White but if Black makes a mistake with 16...Bh5?; 17.e5 Nd5? (17...Be2; 18.Be2 Nd5 and White has just a small edge); 18.Nxd5 cxd5; 19.Nf4 Bg6; 20.Nxg6 Nxg6; 21. Bf5! Qb5; 22.e6!

Since Nf8 is safe and has a good future on e6 while Nf6 is constantly threatened by e5 the choice is simple.

The position is obviously far from winning but from this point on Black has the objective advantage and his game is much easier to play (a huge factor in an OTB game).

This is pretty typical and happens often if the side with the center does not quickly convert it into a more tangible advantage.

During an OTB game if you suspect that you entered your opponent's preparation - try to find a SOLID plan/move that is not likely to be a mainline. (Even when you do not know every nuance of the variation you are playing positional logic can help in finding a good plan during the game. Perfect plans can wait for the post-game analysis!) 2. Classical pawn center should be used dynamically and quickly converted into some other type of advantage (space initiative material). If that is not possible the center very often becomes a target for pressure and turns out to be a liability which needs to be constantly defended. 3. When things get critical (the result of the game is in the balance) slow down and use your time wisely. Playing fast will spare you the time trouble but will often cost you positionally. --- Thank you for looking over this game I can answer any questions on private. Regards Marin Vukusic

791,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was a standard game between two low-ranked players. Play opened with a classic King's pawn game.
792,37,1,b3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Probably a bad move. I wanted to play Bb2 but there was no real reason to do so. Better moves would have been Bb5 (Ruy Lopez) Bc4 (King's pawn game main line) or Nc3 (Three knights game).

My best guess is that he had seen his main attack blunted and did not want to play on without a queen. Thank you for reading this. Comments are welcome.
