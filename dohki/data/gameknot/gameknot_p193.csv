21,0,21,1Nxe5+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp3pp/8/3pn3/2Bq4/5KP1/PPPP4/RNBQ3R w kq -',? I give this move a question mark because I missed the mate but it would have been less interesting.

37,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',In our openings we need to consult the databases and opening books and there are reasons why departures from established theory are bad -- they are dross in the crucible of experience.  In this game black's first error comes on the fourth move and a crucial blunder at move seven makes white's win inevitable.  Yet white confident in the outcome makes a lazy decision at move 14 prolonging the game unnecessarily.
38,1,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/6B1/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',?  This is a departure from established play (4. ... Be7) and it doesn't turn out well.  Unless black can now mobilize the queenside and castle over there he is doomed.
39,1,2,cxd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/3ppp2/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',"The idea seems to have been ""hold the center"" but Qxd5 would have been better."
40,1,3,e4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/3ppp2/8/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq e3',White could have regained the gambit pawn with Qa4+ but to no strategic advantage.  I'm playing to expose black's king. 
41,1,4,Bxc4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2nppp2/q7/2BPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Regaining the gambit pawn.
42,1,5,e5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2np1p2/q3p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',??  Bad move.  Black is behind in development and hasn't castled yet; putting the center in flux leads to his downfall.
43,1,6,1dxe5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2np1p2/q3P3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Exposing black's vulnerable d-pawn . . .
44,1,7,1fxe5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2np4/q3p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',When he promptly makes exactly the wrong move losing immediately.  But 10. ... dxe5 doesn't look promising either. 
45,1,8,Nf6,b'r1b1k2r/pp4pp/2nQ1n2/q3p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',11. ... Ne7 would have at least covered the king a bit but 11. ... Qd8 was his best hope.
46,1,9,Bxe6,b'r3k2r/pp4pp/2nQbn2/q3p3/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',??  Still 12. ... Qd8 was black's only chance.
47,1,10,1Qxe5,b'r3k2r/pp2n1pp/5n2/q3Q3/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Why grab a pawn and trade queens?  An ending could have been forced sooner:  14. Nxe5 Qc5  15. Qf7+ Kd8  16. Rd1+ Kc7  (16. ... Kc8  17. Qd6+ leads to mate in 4) 17. Rd7+ Kb6  18. Rxe7 Qb4 (to prevent 19. Qb3+) 19. Qe6+ Ka5 20. Nc4+ and black must lose the queen mate coming soon afterward.
48,1,11,2Nd4,b'4r1k1/6p1/8/p3P1P1/3N2P1/5rnP/PP6/1K2R1R1 b - -',And the rest of the game is white's slowly grinding his way to a win with the passed pawn.

50,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a fascinating win against one of the leaders of the fast ladder: my 20th game against him.  I'd achieved no wins and only 4 draws previously so this is rather sweet.  It also represents a success for my Caro-Kann Advance Variation in which I've been having a theoretical struggle against a number of players recently few of whom have cooperated as much as my OTB opponent Nathan Manley.
51,2,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Probably the best response to the Advance though it's counter-intuitive moving the pawn a second time.
52,2,2,dxc5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',As recommended by all the resources.
53,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black uses the square vacated by the pawn to attack White's advanced pawn.
54,2,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BPpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"So White pins the knight.  According to Kotronias in his book ""Beating the Caro-Kann"" this was recommended by Boleslavsky.  The game is already assuming a completely different character from the 3...Bf5 variations."
55,2,5,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black lives with the pin counter-attacking White's surplus pawn.  The game is already very cut and thrust - and out of Kotronias's book which only gives 5...Qa5+
56,2,6,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Both sides develop their pieces according to the tactical demands.
57,2,7,Nf5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpPn2/8/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black simultaneously resumes the attack on c5 with an attack on its main defender at e3.  This position is identical with one given in Kotronias's book except that Black hasn't played ...Qa5+ with White responding Nc3.  The game veers sharply into unknown territory hereafter.
58,2,8,Nxe3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/4nN2/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Black seizes the opportunity to gain the advantage of the bishop pair though both his prelates are still at home.  You'll see later how advantageous they are though!
59,2,9,Qa5+,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/qBPpP3/8/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',A classic disruptive check forking King and Bishop while developing Black's own Queen.
60,2,10,1Nc3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/qBPpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White meets it with a normal developing move.
61,2,11,1Bxc6+,b'r1b1kb1r/1p3ppp/p1B1p3/q1PpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White gives up his other Bishop to avoid loss of tempo and hoping that the pawn structure (including an isolated Black a-pawn) will favour the Knights as much as Black's Bishops.
62,2,12,1O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1PpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',White returns the pawn for a more secure King and a developed Rook.
63,2,13,1Qg5,b'r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1bpP1Q1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',This move was aimed not so much in expectation of winning any material as inducing a pawn weakness on Black's kingside.
64,2,14,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1bpP1Q1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black merely castles...

66,2,16,1Rae1,b'r1b2rk1/2q2ppp/p1p1p3/2bpP1Q1/8/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Over-defending the e-pawn gives White's other defending pieces (N and Q) more options.  The Ra1 was chosen for this purpose rather than the Rf1 because that R had responsibility for defending f2.  White now has to guard against Black preparing and playing ...Ba6 winning the exchange of the immobile Rf1.
67,2,17,1Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/2q2ppp/p1p1p3/2bpP1Q1/8/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black seizes the half-open b-file threatening to win a pawn.

70,2,20,1Kh1,b'1rb2rk1/b1q2ppp/p1p1p3/3pP1Q1/1P6/P1N2N2/2P2PPP/4RR1K b - -',A prophylactic move shifting the K off the Black Bishop's diagonal.
71,2,21,1c5,b'1rb2rk1/b1q2ppp/p3p3/2ppP1Q1/1P6/P1N2N2/2P2PPP/4RR1K w - -',Black exploits his Queenside power base to launch a natural-looking attack.
72,2,22,1Na2,b'1rb2rk1/b1q2ppp/p3p3/2ppP1Q1/1P6/P4N2/N1P2PPP/4RR1K b - -',White retreats the QN to defend the b-pawn and also evade several potential attacks.
73,2,23,1Bb7,b'1r3rk1/bbq2ppp/p3p3/2ppP1Q1/1P6/P4N2/N1P2PPP/4RR1K w - -',Now Black's two bishops exert inexorable pressure across the board for most of the rest of the game.  Who in this position wouldn't prefer Black?
74,2,24,1c3,b'1r3rk1/bbq2ppp/p3p3/2ppP1Q1/1P6/P1P2N2/N4PPP/4RR1K b - -',Another waiting move from White not exactly non-committal as it shuts his QN in to a life of misery if Black is similarly inactive.  White's problem was finding something constructive at this point.
75,2,25,1d4,b'1r3rk1/bbq2ppp/p3p3/2p1P1Q1/1P1p4/P1P2N2/N4PPP/4RR1K w - -',Black seizes the opportunity to advance to d4 threatening to create a dangerous passed pawn and opening the white diagonal.
76,2,26,cxd4,b'1r3rk1/bbq2ppp/p3p3/4P1Q1/1P1p4/P4N2/N4PPP/4RR1K w - -',Black has his passed pawn and the lines are opening nicely in his favour.
77,2,27,2Nc1,b'1r3rk1/bbq2ppp/p3p3/4P1Q1/1P1p4/P4N2/5PPP/2N1RR1K b - -',The N's work on a2 was done and it was time to improve White's worst piece while inhibiting the passed pawn.
78,2,28,2Qc3,b'1r3rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P1Q1/1P1p4/P1q2N2/5PPP/2N1RR1K w - -',Black uses the opportunity to attack White's weak queenside pawns with his Q while also supporting the passed pawn's advance.
79,2,29,2Nh4,b'1r3rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P1Q1/1P1p3N/P1q5/5PPP/2N1RR1K b - -',White seeks an illusory counter-attack easily seen off by Black.
80,2,30,2Red1,b'1r3rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P1Q1/1P5N/P1qp4/5PPP/2NR1R1K b - -',White couldn't allow the fork from d2.
81,2,31,2Qg3,b'3r1rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P3/1P5N/P1qp2Q1/5PPP/2NR1R1K b - -',Gradually everything focuses on the pawn on d3.
82,2,32,2Qxa3,b'3r1rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P3/1P5N/q2p2Q1/5PPP/2NR1R1K w - -',Black avoids over-committing to d3's defence instead snaffling the a-pawn and threatening b4.
83,2,33,2Nxd3,b'3r1rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/4P3/1P5N/q2N2Q1/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',White's recapture defends b4 as well.
84,2,34,2Rd5,b'5rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/3rP3/1P5N/q2N2Q1/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',Now Black advances his R threatening to double but also setting up threats to e5 and maintaining the pressure on d3 and d1.
85,2,35,2f4,b'5rk1/bb3ppp/p3p3/3rP3/1P3P1N/q2N2Q1/6PP/3R1R1K b - f3',This move has both defensive and attacking potential...

87,2,37,2Qxb4,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/p3p3/3rP3/1q3P1N/3N1RQ1/6PP/3R3K w - -',White's N is not really defending this pawn because of the pin against d1.
88,2,38,2h3,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/p3p3/3rP3/1q3P1N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K b - -',White has to defend against the potential back row mate.
89,2,39,2Qb6,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/pq2p3/3rP3/5P1N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K w - -',This was slightly mysterious to me ... but you can see the potential against d1 g1 and g2 if White is careless.
90,2,40,2f5,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/pq2p3/3rPP2/7N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K b - -',White resumes his hopeful attack.
91,2,41,2Rd5d4,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/pq2p3/4PP2/3r3N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K w - -',This reveals an attack by the Bb7 on the Rf3 potentially overloading White's Q.
92,2,42,3f6,b'3r2k1/bb3ppp/pq2pP2/4P3/3r3N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K b - -',Now White has virtually his first threat of the game: mate on g7.
93,2,43,3g6,b'3r2k1/bb3p1p/pq2pPp1/4P3/3r3N/3N1RQP/6P1/3R3K w - -',Which of course is easily prevented.
94,2,44,3Rff1,b'3r2k1/bb3p1p/pq2pPp1/4P3/3r3N/3N2QP/6P1/3R1R1K b - -',Now White has to attend once more to defensive duties and the hitherto undefended Rd1.
95,2,45,3Rd8d5,b'6k1/bb3p1p/pq2pPp1/3rP3/3r3N/3N2QP/6P1/3R1R1K w - -',This move adds to the pressure reducing White's available moves without making any specific threats.
96,2,46,3Nf2,b'6k1/bb3p1p/pq2pPp1/3rP3/3r3N/6QP/5NP1/3R1R1K b - -',The N's retreat removes the focus from d3 and maintains defence of d1 while allowing the N the potential of moving via g4 to h6 delivering check and threatening f7.  It also makes itself a potential target for the Q and B on b6 and a7...
97,2,47,3Nxd1,b'6k1/bb3p1p/pq2pPp1/3rP3/7N/6QP/6P1/3N1R1K b - -',Forced.  33. Rxd1 would have lost a piece after 33....Qxf2.
98,2,48,3Bb8,b'1b4k1/1b3p1p/pq2pPp1/3rP3/7N/6QP/6P1/3N1R1K w - -',Black builds pressure on e5 the base of White's little chain.
99,2,49,3Nf3,b'1b4k1/1b3p1p/pq2pPp1/3rP3/8/5NQP/6P1/3N1R1K b - -',So White recentralises a N and defends e5.
100,2,50,3Qd8,b'1b1q2k1/1b3p1p/p3pPp1/3rP3/8/5NQP/6P1/3N1R1K w - -',Black attacks d1 again.
101,2,51,3Ne3,b'1b1q2k1/1b3p1p/p3pPp1/3rP3/8/4NNQP/6P1/5R1K b - -',So the N advances counter-attacking the Rd5 and setting up potential mischief on f5 or via c4 and d6.
102,2,52,3Rd3,b'1b1q2k1/1b3p1p/p3pPp1/4P3/8/3rNNQP/6P1/5R1K w - -',and Black immediately attacks the undefended N skewering it and its brother against White's Q.  The skewer need not become a major problem but White has to make sure every move that it doesn't.
103,2,53,a5,b'1b1q2k1/1b3p1p/4pPp1/p3P3/8/3rNNQP/6P1/4R2K w - -',Black's trump card advances.  This became a passed pawn on move 27 and has remained dormant throughout the manoeuvring since then.
104,2,54,3Qg5,b'1b1q2k1/1b3p1p/4pPp1/p3P1Q1/8/3rNN1P/6P1/4R2K b - -',Rather than succumb to passive defence White seeks to create a mating threat even though it appears to be easily defensible for Black.
105,2,55,3Bxf3,b'1b1q2k1/5p1p/4pPp1/p3P1Q1/8/3rNb1P/6P1/4R2K w - -',Black snaffles one of White's potential attackers further weakening White's K's defences as well.  Was the B worth more than the N though?
106,2,56,Qf8,b'1b3qk1/5p1p/4pPp1/p3P1Q1/8/3rNP1P/8/4R2K w - -',Black neutralises the threat of Qh6 but perhaps this could have been delayed till White was committed?
107,2,57,3f4,b'1b3qk1/5p1p/4pPp1/p3P1Q1/5P2/3rN2P/8/4R2K b - -',The doubled pawn is just another desperado to be thrown at Black's fortress.
108,2,58,4Qg2,b'1b3qk1/5p2/4pPpp/p3P3/5P2/3rN2P/6Q1/4R2K b - -',White retreats to a carefully chosen square which is white thus avoiding any attack by Black's Bishop and preventing any untoward checks by Black's Q on the long diagonal while also potentially exploiting Black's a8 square for a surprise check and covering the square a2 in case the remote passed pawn advances.  Compare these advantages against the Q's other options and this looks like a good move.
109,2,59,4Ba7,b'5qk1/b4p2/4pPpp/p3P3/5P2/3rN2P/6Q1/4R2K w - -',Now the Nf3 is attacked twice.  Defend or move?
110,2,60,4Nc4,b'5qk1/b4p2/4pPpp/p3P3/2N2P2/3r3P/6Q1/4R2K b - -',Counter-attack!
111,2,61,4Nd6,b'5qk1/b4p2/3NpPpp/p3P3/5P2/2r4P/6Q1/4R2K b - -',At the time I thought that Black's last move made taking the a5 pawn too dangerous so I made for this outpost instead.  Maybe I could have taken on a5?  Whatever I liked this move.
112,2,62,4Qb8,b'1q4k1/b4p2/3NpPpp/p3P3/5P2/2r4P/6Q1/4R2K w - -',Black's Q returns to the wide open spaces.  I feared the worst.
113,2,63,4f5,b'1q4k1/b4p2/3NpPpp/p3PP2/8/2r4P/6Q1/4R2K b - -',but I spotted this opportunity at last to exploit the pin of the g-pawn.  Black can only capture with the e-pawn when my recapture with the N threatens the h6 pawn and the e and f pawns become real thorns in Black's position.  So Black probably can't capture allowing White to take on g6 and then break through with the Q.  For the first time in a long time I felt some glimmer of hope.
114,2,64,4Qb3,b'6k1/b4p2/3NpPpp/p3PP2/8/1qr4P/6Q1/4R2K w - -',What's this?  Uh-oh!  White threatens Rxh3+ followed by at least winning White's Q or at worst delivering mate (note that Ba7!).  White has one nuisance check...
115,2,65,4fxg6+,b'Q7/b4p1k/3NpPPp/p3P3/8/1qr4P/8/4R2K b - -',and another... 
116,2,66,4Kxg6,b'Q7/b4p2/3NpPkp/p3P3/8/1qr4P/8/4R2K w - -',with which my gracious opponent advised me that at last I had beaten him; but he didn't resign so I cast around frantically to make sure I didn't miss the winning move and played...
117,2,67,4Qg8+,b'6Q1/b4p2/3NpPkp/p3P3/8/1qr4P/8/4R2K b - -',and he resigned since 46....Kh5 is followed by 47. Qg4#.  I felt that this was a lucky win on my behalf but at least I'd earned it by staying in the game in the face of many subtle threats.  Black had been winning since about move 20.

The best option for Black then would be returning to his original square Ke8

What if Black had played Ke8 instead? Black's response would probably be the natural Nc6 and then what would White do? what immediately leaps to my mind looking at this is 7.d4 an agressive attack on the pinned pawn. One line to answer to this is 7...Bd6 8.Bf4 Qe7 which would probably lead to a mass trade-off. Also possible [bearing in mind that Black doesn't want to lose a pawn] is 7...d6 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Nc3. [ok just noticed Black has 7...Nxd4 8.Qxe5+ Qe7 9.Qxe7 Kxe7]  At any rate I think White's plan should not revolve around the pawn but on quick development and queenside castling to secure the king (Black of course cannot do that) Now back to this position... Options to stop mate would be h6 or Qe7...

I haven't produced a game for annotation from The Annotation Project Part 2 for a long long time.  Here is another game against my buddy Steve - we seem to be quite evenly matched although he is currently leading me 7-5 at the moment.  This is one of my 3 wins against him.  One of my other two wins against him was when I was black in the Annotation Project Part 1.  The other was in the game which I annotated as Ouch! Well in this game it looked anybody's game until late on in the middlegame when it became a massacre in my favour!  We fast forward to move 9 where I decided to put Fou Lenoir on g7. "

Later on I was to try something similar against 8ballphoenix but Henry got himself into a mating net.  Luckily for me in that game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-annotation-project-ii?gm=28260 though my opponent merely thought he had a perpetual so I escaped with a Low Draw - had my opponent been Easy19 I would have been Freddied for sure!

With the text I can get rid of that d pawn at once.  Steve now waves the white flag.  I think with the 7-5 lead he has over me (his wins are 5-3 in his favour the remaining matches were draws) that Steve's rating should be in the 1800s so I was glad to get a win like this one out of him.  I just hope he gets to 1800.  I hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now Joanne

This is a Traxler Tournament Game.  I played my buddy Steve as black and lost that long game sigh.  But here I was white and I ended up with a Low Draw having 2 rooks against the Wicked Witch of the West.  It can be interesting to see how the rooks when they work together can be a tough outfit and the queen can be a menace with her checking powers (Steve's Witch certainly was a menace here).  Anyhow as it was a mini-tourney with forced moves up to 4. ...... Bc5 I will start the action on move 5."

However id=antagonistknigh responded to this move as : 

""First off with 8. ... Ke8 it shows that you are attempting to draw the game by threefold repetition (or at least that is what most people are attempting with that move.) The other thing you may be thinking is that moving your king back to this spot puts him at a more protected location than at c6 now that is a matter of how well you can set up your defenses. There are several holes like e6 e5 and f7 I can use to attack your king. So choose your defense/counterattack carefully.

Best for Black might be trading his Rook for my Knight and a pawn but it is hopeless. This was a methodical win on my part and I was particularly pleased with 15.

473,15,5,Bc8,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/4p3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',not accurate. In my opinion 7..Bd7 was the right move. If White takes the pawn on b7 the black can develop with 8..Nc6 and get a much better play than in this game!! By trying to save the material i lost the positional fight all together!

476,15,8,1Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/8/2B3b1/2NP2Q1/PP4PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',developing the bishop and covering g7 for the other bishop to come out if he has the chance. Other possibilities were 10...c6 covering b7 and preventing Nb5. But finally i realised i had to develop my pieces. If 11 Nb5 now 11..Bb4+ and if 12Kf2 then 12..Na6 and the c7 pawn is protected plus I've developed two of my pieces!!if 12Nc3 then I've simply developed my bishop and theres no threat to c7.

481,15,13,1hxg4,b'rn1k3r/ppp1q1pp/5n2/8/2B2QP1/2NP4/PP1K2P1/R5NR b - -',i resigned here. Its not just the material lose. Whites attack now comes and there's no way out!! But what i wanted to show was in fact not my blunder here!! Blacks position even at best moves was still pressured a lot. That came as a result of Whites energetic play not letting me develop properly and creating threats all over. i responded well up to a point but is hard to play this positions and probably i would have made other mistakes along the way. White on the other hand had a much clearer path and would be much more easier for him to find his way.

Black's queenside expansion could have been more effectively limited by 13. a4 (which I eventually play anyway). Rae1 was better playing in my own theatre of action on the kingside and in the centre.

If the idea is to develop the ls bishop on b7 then it will be a very unhappy bishop blocked by the strongpoint on d5.
493,16,11,1c4,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn1p1p/pp1p1npB/2pP4/2P1P3/1Q1B3P/P2N1PP1/1R3RK1 b - -',Further clamping down on the queenside. I almost played Nc4 (targeting d6) before realising that after 16...b5; 17.Nd2 c4 white loses a piece.

It has the added benefit on pushing black back on the back rank. There is of course the tactical threat that has lingered from move 10 - g5 followed by Bd1 (after Nh5) makes g7 look extremely vulnerable.

538,17,1,Bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/2b5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I'm not sure if 4. ... d6 isn't a better move but I thought doubling the pawns might be a good idea.
539,17,2,Nxf7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2Npp/3p1n2/8/4P3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is typical of a Cochrane Attack with which I'm fairly familiar
540,17,3,Bc4+,b'rnbq3r/ppp2kpp/3p1n2/8/2B1P3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',They key for Black is to avoid getting the king hemmed into a mating net eventually getting the Kingside Rook to e8 and the King itself tucked into a castling position. White must try to avoid the activiation of that Rook.
541,17,4,Kf7,b'rn1qr3/ppp2kpp/3p1n2/6B1/4P3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is a mistake I think. Better is 10. ... Nc6 getting another piece out and blocking off the eventually loss of the b-pawn. Something along the lines of 10. ... Nc6 11. Qd5+ Kd7
542,17,5,1Qd5+,b'rn2r3/ppp2kpp/3p1q2/3Q4/4P3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now I lose more pawns
543,17,6,1Qxc7,b'r3rk2/p1Qn2pp/3p1q2/8/4P3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Those two pawns were extremely damaging even if I don't blunder the Knight later as White might well have been able to push his Queenside pawn majority down upon me forcing me to trade off the Knight in any case.
544,17,7,1Qc6,b'r4k2/p5pp/2Qp1q2/2n5/4r3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I'm not sure 16. Rxe4 isn't a little better as this move allows me to line up my Rooks. As my opponent won this game perhaps I'm wrong.
545,17,8,Nxe4,b'4rk2/p5pp/2Qp3q/8/4n3/2P5/PPP2PPP/R4K2 w - -',We end up in the same position as if White had taken the Rook initially but now my second Rook is on the inviting e-file
546,17,9,1h3,b'4rk2/p5pp/2Qp3q/8/4n3/2P4P/PPP2PP1/R4K2 b - -',White cannot play 19. Re1 Nd2+ 20. Kg1 Rxe1#

548,17,11,Qf7,b'4rk2/p4qpp/2Qp4/8/4n3/2P2P1P/PPP3P1/R4K2 w - -',I was still looking at Knight checks on d2 and g3 but the major threats are now gone and I probably should have moved the Knight away from the danger
549,17,12,Ng3,b'4rk2/p4qpp/2Qp4/8/8/2P2PnP/PPP3P1/R5K1 w - -',I'm still thinking aggressively at this stage and make a terrible blunder. My d-pawn is no longer protected.
550,17,13,2Qxg3,b'4rk2/p3q1pp/8/8/8/2P2PQP/PPP3P1/R5K1 b - -',Now the situation is dire for Black. The Queenside pawn majority is strong but the exposed position of the king eventually brings about the end of the game.
551,17,14,2Qb7,b'4rk2/pq4pp/8/8/8/2P2PQP/PPP3P1/R5K1 w - -',Trying to play actively
552,17,15,2Qd6+,b'4rk2/pq4pp/3Q4/8/8/2P2P1P/PPP3P1/R5K1 b - -',There are just too many checks available that allow White to bring the Rook into the game
553,17,16,Qb6+,b'4r1k1/p5pp/1q6/8/1P3Q2/2P2P1P/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - -',Grasping at straws hoping for a perpetual that does not exist.

555,17,18,Rxc3,b'6k1/p5pp/1q6/8/1P3Q2/2r2P1P/P1P3PK/3R4 w - -',Better is 28. ... Re7 preventing white from getting his Rook to the seventh rank
556,17,19,2Rd7,b'6k1/p2R2pp/1q6/8/1P3Q2/2r2P1P/P1P3PK/8 b - -',Now the mating threats are coming from all directions. 29. ... Rc8 30. Qf7+ Kh8 31. Qxg7# or 29. ... Qg6 30. Rd8+ Qe8 31. Rxe8#
557,17,20,3Rd8,b'1Q1R1qk1/p5pp/8/8/1P6/2r2P1P/P1P3PK/8 b - -',The death blow. There is nothing Black can do now so I resigned. I thought this was a fun game started by my opponents daring Cochrane style attack. While I had my chances my opponent kept up the pressure and took advantage of my mistakes to slowly improve his position and eventually gained a winning attack.

641,20,33,Qd7,b'5r2/p2q3k/1p5p/2p5/P1P2pN1/2Q5/6PP/4R2K w - -',Perhaps flustered by previous mistakes my opponent now follows up with a third poor move. 
642,20,34,3Qxf6,b'8/p2q3k/1p3Q1p/2p5/P1P2p2/8/6PP/4R2K b - -',Now White is in a commanding position and Black must look for Perpetual Check

644,20,36,3Re7,b'8/p3R1qk/1p3Q1p/2p5/P1P2p2/8/6PP/7K b - -',At this point Black resigned. I enjoyed this game because I managed to find some good attacks once I fell behind which forced Black to manuever. Eventually I was fortunate when my opponent made a series of poor moves and I was able to get a win.
645,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Some people have made a life purpose to prove that this is better than 1. e4 or vice-versa. Most notably Hans Berliner has stated that White is won here. Proving it is a whole other ballgame however.
646,21,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I like this over 1...d5 because it leads to much more unbalanced position and tbh I find the Q's Gambit very boring.
647,21,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Seizing central squares. However many defense systems for Black are aimed at exactly this square including the Gruenfeld the Nimzo-indian and the Benko gambit. Maybe one day a super computer will refrain from this pawn advance and play something slower like 2. Nf3. Until then mere mortals like us can only use accepted knowledge to make our decisions.
648,21,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black wants to fianchetto his Bf8 and go for a quick castle. He's postponing the central struggle until he's better developed.
649,21,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',With the aim of playing 4. e4. This move is another reason why 2. c4 was played first. Now the d5 square seems under strict control.
650,21,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',But wait what's this? Black was supposed to castle first then fight in the center. Well that's the KID you're talking about this is his naughty brother the Gruenfeld. I have to confess I really like this opening. Playing it against someone that doesn't know much theory can lead to a very fast and crushing win. The downside is that there is a lot of theory and the resulting position vary a lot so you can't rely on one line to play another you have to know them all.
651,21,6,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White exchanges the c-pawn for the d-pawn and in the process creates for himself a central majority. But just like in the Q's Gambit accepted Black is looking to the future hoping that the endgame will favor him due to the pawn majority on the Q-side.
652,21,7,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't think it really has a name but 4...c6 is a gambit that will surely take White players by surprise in a blitz game.

654,21,9,Nxc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Even though this bolsters White's center retreating the Knight is very bad since more pieces on the board mean more attacking chances and with the center in White's hands it's clear who's going to be the attacker.
655,21,10,bxc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Black's strategy seems to have failed. Just counting the moves White has one extra tempo and on top of that he has acquired a nice looking central phalanx bolstered by the c-pawn. What was Black thinking?
656,21,11,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Older books claimed this is a mistake because now White could play 7. Ba3 to prevent c5. The problem with that move is that the Bishop isn't very active on a3 and Black will make c5 happen with 7...Nd7 anyway.
657,21,12,Bc4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The old main line. White is already envisioning a K-side attack. If Black would play passively that would quickly become a dire reality with Ne2 0-0 and f4-f5 going for the throat.
658,21,13,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Now that Black has completed development it's time for the second strike at the center.
659,21,14,Ne2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',White plays very tidy and rightly so. For example the more natural 8. Nf3 can turn sour very fast after 8...c5 9. 0-0 Bg4 10. Be3 Nc6 and White can't hold the center anymore.
660,21,15,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',If you want to play the Gruenfeld there is a simple rule you always have to remember it's always about White's d-pawn.
661,21,16,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Hans Berliner had a different idea about this position namely 9. Be3 Nc6 10. Rc1 cxd4 11. cxd4 Qa5+ 12. Kf1 which he regarded as won by White. It's strange though that no one has made it work so far.

In several of my recent games Glenda the Defender has found herself on h6 - wow that is in the enemy camp!  Well her excursions into the enemy camp have brought me various types of outcomes.  This is the worst one so I will get this one out of the way now.  This is a mini-tournament which featured the International Master Beafyness who I will remind you scored 1-1 against Coach Ion.  This game is a Sicilian Dragon.  Sicilian Dragons and Sicilian Naijdorfs can be quite hairy because they can involve white castling long and black castling short.  Pawn storms on both sides can ensue.  The question is who will Cop Old Matey first?  I think you can guess the answer here....."
724,24,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - these are pretty standard early Sicilian moves.
725,24,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nc3 - development and supporting the attacked pawn on e4.
726,24,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',6. ...... Bg7 - black's last two moves are characteristic of the Dragon branch of the Sicilian Defense.  As in the King's Indian and the Robatsch Defense the bishop on g7 will rake down all the way to a1.  That bishop will disappear but alas not my problems!
727,24,4,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nppbp/p2p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',8. ...... a6 - preparing a b5 pawn roll and preventing a white knight or bishop settling in on b5.

Now Ion steals a pawn in broad daylight.  I cannot recapture with the f3 pawn because the pawn on c2 and the h1 rook will be forked.  Also I have the possibility of a knight fork on f2 to contend with ....... aaargh!  There is only one thing to do ......
730,24,7,1Qe3,b'2rqk2r/1b1n1p1p/p2p2p1/4p3/1p2n1P1/1N2QP2/PPP1N2P/1K1R1B1R b k -',16. Qe3 - Glenda to the rescue!  At least she does have a threat of hopping on her broomstick to a7 and attacking that lsb on b7.  The Wicked Witch of the West scotches that plan not only defending that turbulent prelate but piling up on my poor c2 pawn forcing my rook to defend it.
731,24,8,Nxc5,b'2r1k2r/1bq2p1p/p2p2p1/2n1p3/1p4P1/4QP2/PPP1N2P/1KR2B1R w k -',18. ....... Nxc5 - knight trade.

738,24,15,Qa5,b'2r2rk1/1b3p1p/p5pQ/q3pP2/3p2PP/1n6/1PP1N3/1KR2BR1 w - -',"24. ...... Qa5 - the killer!  It is now mate in 4.  Please see Puzzle #21641 to work out how this will come about.  I decided to finish things on my own terms.  At least it looks in the final position as though I have just been pipped at the post.  I hope you have all had a good read.

Bye for now.

White would have the choice of either capturing with the pawn or losing the d4 pawn.
757,26,4,1gxf3,b'r2qkb1r/4pppp/p1np1n2/1p6/3PP3/1B1Q1P2/PP3P1P/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This is what black was hoping for although white can still use this to her advantage.

For when white moves f4 my knight is only defended by my queen if I capture f4.  Hopefully I can maneuver a pawn to g5 before it gets too bad.  (This was my thinking at the time.  However I can now see that black will inevitably be down 1 point after the exchange).

I preemptively move my king with an idea of g6 threatening white's pawn on f5 (when moved).
766,26,13,2Ne2,b'2r2r2/4bp1k/pq1p1npp/1p1PpP2/3nP3/1P1QB3/P3NP1P/2RB1R1K b - -',Now black's knight is in big trouble.  White may be up 1 point after the exchange.  I will stall white and try to gain position by capturing white's rook.

The main idea from the first game remains: transfer the knight to e6 followed by opening the center but the text sharply enlivens the tactical set-up.  The Queen from b3 'X-rays' the Black King and simultaneously 'looks' at the b7-pawn which could be vulnerable to capture after an eventual exchange of the bishop for the e6-knight.  The theoretical dispute with Fischer has found a new impulse!

The battery of white pieces has come into action!  However had I been in a less martial mood I might have contented myself with the quiet 16.Nf3 maintaining White's doubtless positional plusses. (My humble comment: This move is the cause of rapid deterioration of White's advantage. 16.Nf3 as Taimanov notes is the correct move to maintain White's advantage. Here the psychology of Taimanov is revealed! He was in an aggressive mood and relied on attack and ignored the requirements of the position. Have we all also fallen prey to such emotions in our games? Sure we did. It is part of the learning in this game. Chess logic overrides emotions and player strengths. We have to play according to the requirements of the position. )

I do not stint on one more diagram as it not only reflects both the culmination and turning-point of this game but the match as a whole.  Fischer himself later recognized it: ""It was the turning point of the match.  Taimanov missed a win by 20. Qh3.""  It additionally serves as a reference point to all the subsequent and unpredictable dramatic peripeteias [ed. philosophical self-questioning Aristotle] which befell me.

I remember that at that moment I felt a veritable ecstasy from the struggle - I estimated the position as rather advantageous.  I trusted in success pleased at my good luck employing my opening preparation and in the idea of rapid development of the initiative -and the maneuver 20. Qh3 for example.  Was it was possible to anticipate that all this would turn to ashes?!

Disappointment began from the moment when I cheerfully having estimated the position began to concretely calculate variations.  It was obvious that after 20.Qh3 Black in view of the threat 21. Rxh6+ has only two defenses - 20...Nf6 and 20...Rf6.  I began to examine them in the happy belief that any attempt to cover the gaping approaches to the Black King would be impossible.

The move 20...Nf6 really did not shake my optimism.  Variations found without any special work are: 20.Qh3 Nf6 21.Bc3 f4 ( other continuations are worse. For example 21...Bd7 22.Ne6 Bxe6 23.Rxe6; or 21...Ng4 22.Rg6! Rf6 23.Qh5) 22.Qh4 Bb7 ( 22...Qe8 23.Bf3!) 23.Rd1 Qe7 24.Re6 Qc5+ 25.Kh1 are obviously developments to White's benefit.

But I couldn’t find any decisive continuation on 20...Rf6 in any continuation.  First it seemed to me that good is 21.Qh5 but in testing it I didn’t like 21...Bd7! 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Nf7+ Kh7 24.Nxh6 Bxh6 25.Bxh6 Qg6!.  The idea of 21.Nf7+ Rxf7 22.Bxh6 was entertained but I found a refutation at once in 22...Bf6.  At last I found the best plan: 21.Bc4! when really in view of 21...Rxc6 22.Nf7+ the White rook is impregnable.  Now 22.Rxf6 is simply threatened and both replies 21...Bd7 22.Bxd5 and 21...Bb7 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Rxf5 are poor.

It would seem that the required decision has held up to scrutiny but is complicated by the response 21… f4.  To everything that I have here examined alas there was an objection:

On 22.Qh5 possible was 22...Bb7 23.Bxd5 (or 23.Rxf6 Qxf6) 23...Qxd5;
On 22.Qh4 - Bb7 23.Ne6 Qd7;
On 22.Qd3 - 22...hxg5 23.Rxf6 Bxf6;
And finally on 22.Qf3!? - Bb7! 23.Rxf6 (23.Ne6 Qd7! 24.Bxd5 Rxe6!) 23...Nxf6! 24.Nf7+ Kh7 25.Qxb7 (25.Bd3+ Kg8!) 25...Qxd2 26.Qxa8 Qd4+ 27.Kh1 Qxc4.

In all variations Fischer emerges in the clear.

It was amazing!  All my understanding of chess all my experience and flair convinced me this position should be won but concrete ways to victory did not appear.  Disappointed in 20. Qh3! I began to evaluate other ideas - 20. Rd1 20. Bc4 but"

(My humble comments:  Lessons I have learnt from this famous game are given below:
1. Positional assessment is difficult for even the top players including Fischer. So play carefully trying to assess the position as the moves unfold.
2. When your idea fails don't start brooding accept the position and play for a draw at least.
3. Expect the unexpected! 
4. Take it as only a  game. Don't get psychologically wrecked by one game. Mark Taimanov's contributions to opening theory are well respected in Benoni King's Indian defence and Sicilian. So after all it is a game enjoy it!!!)"

883,29,43,5c5,b'8/8/3bN3/k1P5/4p1p1/1P1nB3/4K1P1/8 b - -',"!? A sharp line that shows that gives Black no time for …Kb4. On the other hand the connected passed pawns now begin to get separated and harder to defend.

Ng5 simply going after the e-pawn also deserved consideration."
884,29,44,6c6,b'8/8/2P1N3/k3b3/4p1p1/1P1nB3/4K1P1/8 b - -',"? In hindsight though this move looks scary I think it is the reason Black could escape with a draw. The pawn now gets too advanced and although Black must play extremely carefully it is eventually lost.
60. Bd2+ Kb5 (Nb4? 61. c6! and Black loses a piece) 61. b4!? with the idea of 61. …Nxb4? 62. Bxb4 Kxb4 63. c6! and stopping the pawn will cost a Bishop. If Black can find a way to hold against this line however then perhaps we must go even further back to find a win for White.

889,29,49,6Nf2,b'8/8/k1P5/4b3/6p1/1P6/4KNP1/8 b - -',? Going after my last pawn. It was more challenging to play Kd3 though and focus on shepherding home the remaining Queenside pawn. This would be similar to the actual game continuation except that there would be an extra pair of pawns on the board to increase the winning chances.
890,29,50,Kb5,b'8/8/8/1k2b3/8/1P3KN1/6P1/8 w - -',I almost resigned instead of playing this move. Thank goodness I didn't! It is so easy to miss all the multitude of resources which are hidden in seemingly terrible positions. Here even (temporarily) two pawns down in a simplified endgame it seems that Black can draw no matter what White does!
891,29,51,6Nh5,b'8/8/8/1k2b2N/8/1P3K2/6P1/8 b - -',"At this point I thought that White had just thrown the game away. I wrote:
""68. Ne4! is the key refusing to abandon the b-pawn so easily. 68. Ne4 Kb4 69. Nd2 Bc3 70. Ke2 and if Black trades pieces and wins the b-pawn then the g-pawn Queens. Otherwise White will bring the King around to c2 switch the Knight to the Kingside and Black cannot stop both pawns.""
Thanks to nuntar's input I now realize that 69. …Kc3! should hold here. Therefore we have to look earlier for where White could have saved the win."
892,29,52,Bh8,b'7b/8/8/7N/1k2K3/1P6/6P1/8 w - -',"! Plenty of other Bishop moves are good but the exclam is for instructive value: this move goes to the heart of the position. To win White needs to get the g-pawn to g8 without ever allowing Black to sac the Bishop for it. As long as the Bishop stays on the h8-a1 diagonal the only way to prevent that sac is by blocking the diagonal with Nf6. Thus Black puts the Bishop ""inside"" f6 so that White cannot block the Bishop without first ejecting it from h8. To do this the White King must go to h7 or g8 where it no longer can support a Knight on f6. Since the White King cannot control h8 and f6 at once White will need to bring up the pawn to support f6. That will give the Black King time to get back and control f6 himself after which the Bishop cannot be blocked at all."
893,29,53,Kc4,b'7b/8/8/5K1N/2k3P1/8/8/8 w - -',The King hurries back to help control f6 after which the draw is assured for the reasons already stated at move 69.
894,29,54,7Kg6,b'7b/8/6K1/3k2PN/8/8/8/8 b - -',!? Tricksy! White has found a new way to deal with the Bishop: he threatens Nf6 first and then Kh7 forcing a trade into a won King and Pawn endgame. Unfortunately for White however Black will simply retreat his Bishop for just long enough for the King to arrive and help out.
895,29,55,7Bd4,b'8/8/6K1/3k2PN/3b4/8/8/8 w - -',! Nf6 is now met with Ke3 and the pawn is tied to the defense of the Knight.
896,29,56,Ke5,b'8/5K2/8/4k1PN/3b4/8/8/8 w - -',! It doesn't matter that the King blocks the Bishop temporarily. Black threatens to install the King on f4 forcing g3 and keeping the Knight of f6 forever.
897,29,57,7Nh7,b'8/5K1N/8/5kP1/3b4/8/8/8 b - -',Otherwise we just repeat moves. 76. g6? Bxf6 is no help of course.
898,29,58,7Ne6,b'8/5K2/4N1P1/5k2/8/2b5/8/8 b - -',And White seeing that there is no way to advance further offered a draw. A very lucky escape against the top seed in my tournament group! At the same time it teaches us to keep struggling as long as there are any chances left at all.
