14,0,14,1Rf3,b'r2r2k1/2pp1pp1/bpn4p/p3p3/P3P3/2PPqRP1/2P1N1BP/R2QK3 b Q -',That will work.

19,0,19,1Ne7,b'r5k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p2rp3/P5qP/2PP1RP1/Q1P1N1B1/R3K3 w Q -',He nicely protects it.

23,0,23,2Rd4,b'r5k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PrP1qP/5RP1/Q1P1N1B1/R3K3 w Q -',Well we were. I know he wasn't wanting to give up his rook either but he overlooked my knight.
24,0,24,2Nxd4,b'r5k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PNP1qP/5RP1/Q1P3B1/R3K3 b Q -',Now I have a big advantage! He's gonna have to work hard now.
25,0,25,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PNP1qP/5RP1/Q1P3B1/R3K3 w Q -',To me knights can be very useful so he wasn't getting it that easily.
26,0,26,2O-O-O,b'3r2k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PNP1qP/5RP1/Q1P3B1/2KR4 b - -',This definitely helps me out. I castle queen-side and defend the knight.
27,0,27,2Qxe4,b'3r2k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PNq2P/5RP1/Q1P3B1/2KR4 w - -',That pawn was a goner anyway.
28,0,28,2Qb2,b'3r2k1/2p1npp1/bp5p/p7/P1PNq2P/5RP1/1QP3B1/2KR4 b - -',Not the best move.
29,0,29,2Bxc4,b'3r2k1/2p1npp1/1p5p/p7/P1bNq2P/5RP1/1QP3B1/2KR4 w - -',Now I lost that pawn.
30,0,30,c5,b'3r2k1/4npp1/1p5p/p1p5/P1bNq2P/2P2RP1/1Q4B1/2KR4 w - c6',Not the best move for him. True my knight is at risk but his b6 pawn is a goner now.
31,0,31,2Qxb6,b'3r2k1/4npp1/1Q5p/p1p5/P1bNq2P/2P2RP1/6B1/2KR4 b - -',On top of that his rook is in danger now.
32,0,32,2cxd4,b'3r2k1/4npp1/1Q5p/p7/P1bpq2P/2P2RP1/6B1/2KR4 w - -',??? His rook is gone now! He may have my knight but the only powerful piece he'll have left is his queen. Any move that defended his rook would of been way better than the move he just did here.
33,0,33,2Qxd8+,b'3Q2k1/4npp1/7p/p7/P1bpq2P/2P2RP1/6B1/2KR4 b - -',On top of another rook gone his king is now in danger.
34,0,34,2Rxd4,b'3Q4/4nppk/7p/p7/P1bRq2P/2P2RP1/6B1/2K5 b - -',My advantage continues to grow.
35,0,35,3Bf1,b'3Q4/4nppk/7p/p3q3/P1b4P/2P2RP1/8/2KR1B2 b - -',I go for his bishop.
36,0,36,3Bb3,b'3Q4/4nppk/7p/p3q3/P6P/1bP2RP1/8/2KR1B2 w - -',His king is in quite a pickle and he doesn't realize it.
37,0,37,3Rdf1,b'3Q4/4np1k/6pp/p3q3/P6P/1bPB1RP1/8/2K2R2 b - -',I prepare to attack hard.
38,0,38,3f5,b'3Q4/4n2k/6pp/p3qp2/P6P/1bPB1RP1/8/2K2R2 w - f6',He defends stopping my attack.
39,0,39,Bxa4,b'Q7/4n2k/6pp/p3qp2/b6P/2PB1RP1/8/2K2R2 w - -',I'm not really worried about my pawns at this point for I see opportunity for checkmate.
40,0,40,3Bc2,b'Q7/4n2k/6pp/p3qp2/b6P/2P2RP1/2B5/2K2R2 b - -',But first his bishop again.
41,0,41,3Bc6,b'Q7/4n2k/2b3pp/p3qp2/7P/2P2RP1/2B5/2K2R2 w - -',Darn I didn't see that coming. Of course I save my queen but now I lose one of my rooks. My advantage is shrinking some.
42,0,42,3Rxf3,b'3Q4/4n2k/6pp/p3qp2/7P/2P2RP1/2B5/2K5 b - -',Well I got the bishop. I'm getting ready to end this now.
43,0,43,3Qe1+,b'3Q4/4n2k/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P2RP1/2B5/2K1q3 w - -',But he'll make me work for it.
44,0,44,3Rd3,b'3Q2n1/7k/6pp/p4p2/7P/2PR2P1/1KB5/4q3 b - -',About to attack hard.
45,0,45,3Qf2,b'3Q2n1/7k/6pp/p4p2/7P/2PR2P1/1KB2q2/8 w - -',Two pieces lined up like that should give you a hint that a attack is coming. That move didn't help his situation at all.
46,0,46,Kh8,b'3Q2nk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P3P1/1KB2q2/8 w - -',The knight is gonna hinder progress.
47,0,47,4Qf8,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P3P1/1KB2q2/8 b - -',Checkmate is inevitable at least I thought but my opponent was not gonna give up easily.
48,0,48,4Kb2,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P1q1P1/1KB5/8 b - -',Repetition occurs a little here.
49,0,49,Qg1+,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P3P1/2B5/2K3q1 w - -',I realized here that he was going to keep putting me in check relentlessly trying to do anything to prevent checkmate. I realized that if I stayed around the bishop the game could eventually end in a threefold repetition. I knew I could win this so I was gonna have to leave those pieces and plan a new strategy. 
50,0,50,4Kd1,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2P3P1/2B2q2/3K4 b - -',I try to change it up some here.
51,0,51,4Kd3,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p4p2/7P/2PK2P1/2B2q2/8 b - -',I must head for my strong pieces.
52,0,52,5Bd3,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p2K1p2/7P/2PB2P1/3q4/8 b - -',I get desperate here. Definitely not a great move. My bishop is completely unprotected.
53,0,53,5Qa2+,b'5Qnk/3R4/6pp/p2K1p2/7P/2PB2P1/q7/8 w - -',A much worse move by him! He should of taken my bishop!
54,0,54,Qg2+,b'5Qnk/3R4/2K3pp/p4p2/2B4P/2P3P1/6q1/8 w - -',Again he should of taken my bishop when he had the chance.
55,0,55,5Bd5,b'5Qnk/3R4/2K3pp/p2B1p2/7P/2P3P1/6q1/8 b - -',This move now prevents him from putting me in check and the c3 pawn makes intervention impossible thus my next move Qg7# was inevitable. kraaifontein resigned and this wonderful game was over. I hope you enjoyed this annotation! 
56,1,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I'm playing the Queen's Gambit more or less my favorite when playing white.
57,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',He answers with the Symmetrical/Austrian Defense an uncommon variation of the QG Declined according to my research and I myself encountered it the first time since playing the QG opening.
58,1,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue with Nf3 to strengthen d4 and e5. In addition I wanted to begin with the development of my minor pieces which is why I was hesitant of cxd5.
59,1,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So far he mirrored everyone of my moves.
60,1,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Further development...
61,1,5,Nxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',An exchange of pawns leaving me with a centred knight.
62,1,6,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/2pN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',In my opinion not the best move. e5 would've forced the retreat of the knight as well as opening the path for his bishop... Instead he allows me to take over control of the centre with e5 + opening the path for my white bishop to attack his c-pawn.
63,1,7,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/2pNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',Now comes said move forcing me to step back and propose the queen exchange.
64,1,8,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2p1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Good move imo declining the exchange as well developing the black bishop and preparing 0-0.
65,1,9,Bxc4,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I reclaim the lost pawn and prepare for 0-0 as well.
66,1,10,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Development as well as pinning the knight and thus weakening his claim to the centre.

69,1,13,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2n2n1p/2bNp3/2B1P2B/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I decline since Qxd8 would've activated his rook and would not have brought any advantage to me. In addition I put additional pressure on the knight.

I think this demonstrates nicely the importance of keeping the pawns in line when having a castled king since otherwise the pressure can rise to the point where material has to be sacrificed in order to remain in the game.

No he can not! This is not as good because it weakens white's central dominance and secondly it allows black to untangle his bad queen side pawns.  The end result is that white has no chance of moving the d-pawn forward. Instead it becomes the victim of attack.

After which pawns are exchanged. So then comes 3.exd5 exd5. This move however blocks in your DSB (Dark Square Bishop) so that you'll have to cram it or waste tempii to get it out.  Then he said ""My thought was to possibly develop my knights and force you to make the attack.  I am thinking pretty far out of the box I know. I will soon assess how aggressive your play will be.""  Then I told him that the interesting thing is that thinking ahead is always a good thing. The only thing to be aware of is that when planning in advance calculation is also important. Because one can think but at the same time miss something that's important."
170,6,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I decide to take advantage of my opportunity to develop a piece.

172,6,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppn2/6B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',"So I decide to pin his N as opposed to develop my LSB right away.  I know what he's up to.  In it I said I think I know what you wanted in this postion. But the idea is to expect the unexpected. What if your opponent plays something that you didn't expect. Like for example you were thinking along the lines of 4.e5!? with the idea being that we exchange I reattack you force a Q exchange which would take away my opportunity to castle and then your N retreats. So 4.e5 dxe5 5.dxe5 Qxd1+ 6.Kxd1 But what's good to keep in mind as GM Judit Polgar said in the Alkehine Tournament is to try and get your opponent out of the comfort zone. Meaning: that in general you don't want to play something that your opponent is comfortable with. Now the thing about 4.e5 is that I'm familiar with it because something like that has happened in a couple of my past games.  But let's suppose this happened. 4.e5?! dxe5. Instead of taking back with 5.dxe5 white could recapture with 5.Nxe5 so there's more to a story then meets the eye. This is very difficult to do and on rare occasions I still make this error. But a good idea is to ""be a spectator of your game"" as easy19 puts it. This means to look at the entire board and not just one move on there.  Then he said ""That was the better case scenario but not at all what I expect. I do in fact expect the unexpected from a more advanced player. You as white are one move ahead I need to stay aware of cross attacks at c6"""
173,6,7,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3ppn1p/6B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Most common way of breaking a pin in this position is 4...Be7.  But there is nothing wrong with this choice.
174,6,8,Bxf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3ppB1p/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',"So I told the1trueseeker that in this position I would normally retreat by playing Bh4 as a direct result.  If 5.Bh4 g5 6.Bg3. This is commonly played. So normally that wouldn't be a problem but the issue here is that you would win a free pawn because of 6...Nxe4. So another common variation is to exchange your B for my N. BTW while this is a common way to break the pin most common is 4...Be7 as it also develops a piece at the same time.  Then he said ""Had I been truly concerned for the pawn at e4 kings bishop d3 would have been my choice defensively. It would have blocked my knight and kept your bishop in play. For me I had two simple choices since your bishop was attacking my queen. I could have broke ranks and doubled up pawns in file f or moved my queen into a prominent position but also vulnerable for the e4-e5"""

I'm a little ADD and on games that show few moves I forget my original ideas and get lost in the mire. I'm a little at a disadvantage after polishing off quite a few glasses of whiskey. Bird Dog Peach if you are familiar with the fine taste of two worlds of flavor. It's not too expensive but much like a fine wine over ice... LOL""  Then I said Yes but the move you played in general is better then doubling pawns. It all has to do with pawn structures. Sometimes believe it or not doubled pawns can benefit but around the K it's generally not a good idea as it could leave it vulnerable to exposure. And if it helps you learn sure I'll do some of the consecutive moves. The question is how do we do that?"

I could see that you were online last night and had my update alarms set to signal moves made. I was in a good mood to play. Not tired as I am tonight... Regardless I will try to stay focused and analyze my moves more carefully than I sometimes do in games. I will many times take less than 30 seconds to review a board and choose my move.

I am certain that at any time you may do something to upset this fragile peace.""  So I said the idea behind that exchange is that if I didn't take but instead retreated I would have been down a pawn. The idea is ""Don't give things away."" And this is a well known fact. The reason being is that although we're no where near that phase towards the end and generally in an endgame both players are left with a few pawns and the K. Now one pawn is usually enough to make or break a game as it is the thing that often promotes.  "

If I continue to pursue your bishop or go for an attack on your knight I will affect my defense. I am posturing to castle although I hate to castle prior to my opponent.""  So I accurately told him that there's nothing wrong with that. The idea is to castle ASAP but it's not too late for you to castle in this position.  The problem right now however is that your DSB is jammed which is why ...e5 was better then ...e6."

This time he failed my quiz which is something that I absolutely enjoy about teaching since it is a way for the student.  In it I said ? As it turns out this move was a quiz. And this move is a mistake because of what's about to come in the next several moves.  Actually I just looked at it and this move is actually a serious blunder. The idea here is that what I recently learned from my coach. Sometimes when material is attacked it's better not to try fancy (capturing immediately). It's better to run away. The idea is to think about the positions and after getting rid of one attack can anything else be attacked or captured in that position.  So @the1true seeker: Better was move the N out of harm's way either by attacking my f3 N or retreating it.  Because of this move in a few moves from now I am going to win free a pawn and R.

That's why were here and reason that I enjoy mentoring.  Actually what I meant is that your previous move so 11...exd5?? was a blunder.

It's called hyperfofcus and until recently this was also one of my main weaknesses. Where you think a lot about one thing but in exchange miss the threat.

Now I don't want to get queen lost in a trap.  I am looking hard but still don't see a valid attack from your queen. Who I am most concerned and focused on at this point. I think my greatest deficit is getting confused on the multitude of moves that another can make. I honestly only see formations.""  So my reply was that can happen I know what you're saying. The idea is to focus on your opponents and your plans. The best way to avoid confusion is by using the analyze the board feature. It really makes your mind work and play with different positions to decide the best move or what the situation is."

Not only does that alleviate your K exposure to some extent but at the same time it also protects your LSB so that you wouldn't lose anything else. But you said that you get confused on the amount of move one can make. Instead of getting confused it's important to think about that and take things into consideration. Don't let your mind get confused like that as it could cause problems as is the case here.  In fact @the1trueseeker: This is the losing blunder.

While the game is now lost I decided to give Kevin some encouragement to prevent him resigning.  Why?  Because you learn by staying in the game even if it is a lost position.  The idea is ""Don't give up right away.  Study the positions"".  So I decided that by staying in there was more that I could actually teach me student.  In that I said Don't give up hope yet. That's because while it might appear lost sometimes you can pull a swindle which means draw or even win a lost game. And don't get upset with yourself because we're here for you to learn and making these kinds of mistakes is also a good learning experience for you. Another thing is that getting angry can lead to more mistakes so it's best to stay calm and see what else you can learn. That's one of the beauties of chess.  I did this with the smiley face."

The idea being that you want to figure out if your opponent has a weakness and if so how to take advantage of it. Chess is also about excercising your mind which is why it's also a sport. It's not anything like basketball or softball physically but it is like it mentally. In that it makes you really concentrate and work your mind.

Don't quit and always try the best that you can. And now I understand. In general playing too many games is not good. You said that you had 30 in progress at one point. This is the only thing I ever disagreed with a mentor. And for about a month a little over a year and a half ago I believe it was I had about the same rating that you have. I used to play a lot and at one point my average time per move was only 16 minutes. There is a lot to absorb and digest in chess and playing too much and too quickly limits and sometimes prevents you from concentrating. Playing too many cause can cause stress which essentially causes rushing. Now concentration is key. But in my mind you're doing the right thing and figuring what the problem is. This will also help you to improve.

And thinking that mate is soon to follow without actually knowing is not good enough.

Instead of getting confused analyze and concentrate on the positions.  In addition don't play too fast or too many games at one time.

OK see if you can guess his next move - and generally see if you can guess his moves from now on. See if you can play as well as him!

If he had played his queen to h5 I can save myself by Qe6 check followed by Qg5. He wants to play Bc1 and take on h6. If he plays Bc1 first then I can play Qc6 and then take on f6. There is no defense now. Probably best is Qc6 hitting f6 he plays Qh4 then I can play Rg8 threatening mate on g2. He meets it with say g3. Now the only way for me to avoid the disastrous lost of the h6 pawn is Rg5 meeting Bc1 with Qxf6 he exchanges on g5 and I end up the exchange (rook for bishop) and pawn down in a hopeless ending. I decide instead to give a knight back hoping against hope that he will go wrong in the complications.

My king and queen are lined up and Dad has a white bishop handy to skewer them if I capture it with my knight. But I do so anyway because if I play my pawn to c6 then that should deal with the bishop.
310,10,7,Nfg4,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1n3/4P1n1/1PN4q/PBPPBP2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Things are looking very poorly for white.  As far as I can tell the only way to prevent Qh2# is to trade out both his white bishop and queen.
311,11,0,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',All standard Kings Indian so far.
312,11,1,h3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',It's in the book but not very common.  I think it's a fairly pointless move at this stage as I have not intention of putting either my B or my N on g4 in the near future.
313,11,2,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ -',This is another move I don't come across very often.  It's a nuisance because it hinders my normal plan of ...e5 followed shortly after by ...Ne8 or ...Nd7 or ...Nh5 and then ...f5.  I don't like to try pushing it away immediately as it makes the pawn on h6 a target for White's Q & B.
314,11,3,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ -',I don't think I've tried this before.  The main purpose was to prevent Nd5 but it also increases the Q's scope on the Q-side.  I think I've usually met Bg5 with ...Qe8 but for some reason I decided against that this time.
315,11,4,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p1B1/2PPP3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R w KQ e6',The standard King's Indian central break but this time it pins my own N.

317,11,6,1Qd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',White retains the option of castling either side and prepares to attack the fianchettoed bishop.

324,11,13,Qf7,b'r1b1nrk1/pp3qbp/2pp1n2/3PppB1/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1Q1PP1/1BR2RK1 w - -',Black slowly builds up for a decisive kingside attack on the finally castled king.  I needed to play this before I developed my QB as the QB would have prevented my Q from getting across to the kingside where I wanted it.

329,11,18,1Nc7,b'3r1rk1/p1nb1qbp/2pp3B/4ppQn/2P4N/1PN4P/P4PP1/1BR2RK1 w - -',This move looks odd because it takes the N away from the action but it connects my rooks and threatens to counter-attack the Q with ...Ne6.  It isn't needed to defend d6 any more nor g7 which is defended albeit awkwardly by the Nh5 as well as by Q and K.
330,11,19,2Bxg7,b'3r1rk1/p1nb1qBp/2pp4/4ppQn/2P4N/1PN4P/P4PP1/1BR2RK1 b - -',Attacking the Nh5 with g4 might have been better.  White never quite brought enough power into his attack.

334,11,23,2Rg3,b'2br1rk1/p5np/2pp4/2P1pp1q/8/1PN3RP/P4P2/1BQ2RK1 b - -',This runs into trouble.  Perhaps a K move would have been better.

It has been quite a while since my last annotation but I have found time to annotate this game.  It was a Modern Benoni MT and in the middle game Bwaa who will be referred to as Bwaa because he has the same Christian name as my king lost a pawn.  It was not very easy to make headway but there was a sudden twist at the end.  We got into an endgame in jig time but there were enough pieces left on the board for Old Matey the Chessic Grim Reaper to have a say in the matter.  Bwaa had put up his vacation flag to say that he had gone away for a long weekend and his queen travelled with him in his suitcase!  When they returned to the battlefield they were in for a shock for they discovered a very unwelcome intruder indeed.  I think I had better let you guys read on to find out who the intruder was and what happened next.  I will start the game after 5. ..... d6 which is the end of the themed moves."

Here it not only blocks a check but it also blocks in Fou Leblanc.  However it is one of the most recommended moves in the World DB so there is some deeper reason behind this.  Aha it does open up the possibility of a queen check on h4 and the long diagonal for Fou Lenoir which may come in useful later on.

The Witch is pinned to her other half and cannot block the check and therefore despite it being an endgame Old Matey has the final say here.  I am now playing two games with the white pieces against bwaa and I must play very well as he once got very close to becoming a Class A player himself in order to avoid him getting double revenge on me!

724,25,41,3Qe4+,b'6q1/1R4p1/2P2pkp/8/2P1QPPP/1PN5/3r3N/5RK1 b - -',The only move black could make was 32. f5 which ultimately would of led to 33. Qxf5# With checkmate inevitable white resigns and this wonderful game was over. After the game claudioa wanted to know how I kept my rating so low. I was still fairly new at Gameknot at the time but this game showed the hidden skills I can sometimes muster up. I hope you enjoyed this annotation!

My obvious concern is that my queen will spend the next few turns being chased around the board while Aleks develops his pieces.  There are some games in the database that play this move so I figured why not it looks like fun :)

I'm expecting him to play Ng4 at some point which would threaten to fork my rooks as well as my queen if she is on d3. Hopefully if I play Rd2 it will be sufficient to prevent it."
745,27,6,Ng4,b'r4rk1/pppqbppp/2bp4/8/4PBnP/2NQ1N2/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',As expected. I'll defend the f2 square with Rd2. Him moving the knight has opened up my queen's access to h7 for now.

Let's see if black plays Ke6 then Bb3+ black would have to block with Nc4 and then Bxc4#! what if black plays Ke8 instead of Ke6? Then Nf6# discovered double check and mate! That's the end of the game black made several mistakes but his biggest mistake was not developing his pieces fast enough. Anyway I think it is an interesting game overall and I definitely enjoyed playing it. Thanks for your attention I hope you also enjoyed it feel free to leave comments. Chao!

Just hoping it isn't leading to my midgame nightmares against The Dentist where severe passivitis used to set in.

908,34,20,3Qg1,b'6k1/8/3p2p1/1pp1p2p/4Pq2/P2P3P/1P6/6QK b - -',However If White had traded queens with 35. Qxf4 exf4 36. b3 Kf7 37. h4 f3 38. Kg1 Ke6 White eventually captures the pawn and even has a small advantage which would end up in a draw.

916,34,28,4Kh2,b'8/8/3p2k1/1p2p3/1P2P1p1/3P1q2/6QK/8 b - -',And of course White loses his chance to draw and to take advantage of Black's mistake. 46. Qxf3 gxf3 47. Kh2 etc takes the pawn and levels things up. Now Black can exchange and win by forcing his pawn through.
917,34,29,4Kg2,b'8/8/3p4/1p2p2k/1P2P1p1/3P4/6K1/8 b - -',This was given as a blunder as Black's task is exponentially easier. 49. Kf2! Gaining a tempo causes Black more problems but eventually Black still wins. The rest of the moves are more or less forced.

956,36,16,3Kf4,b'8/2p2b2/p4k2/1pp2P1p/5KP1/P1P4P/1P6/8 b - -',Of course he doesn't take it.
957,36,17,Bc4,b'8/2p5/p4k2/1pp2P2/2b2KP1/P1P5/1P6/8 w - -',I really liked this spot for my bishop. When things come down to the bitter end his King can't cross any of D3-6. It also poses a challenge for him to get his pawns through G8 and F7.

Taking back with the pawn was possible and gives a slight edge to Black in terms of more space controlled. This is better though it makes it a lot easier to attack the weak White pawn on d3 along the semi-open d file.

1050,38,44,2Rc1,b'r3r1k1/1pq2ppp/p1b5/2p5/8/3P1N2/PP2RPPP/2R1Q1K1 b - -',White mobilises her other rook.

1053,38,47,2Re8,b'4r1k1/1pq2ppp/p1b5/2p5/8/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/2R3K1 w - -',Black hits the queen
1054,38,48,2Qd1,b'4r1k1/1pq2ppp/p1b5/2p5/8/3P1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ2K1 b - -',Queen drops back keeping a protection on Nf3
1055,38,49,2Qf4,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p1b5/2p5/5q2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ2K1 w - -',Black advances her queen
1056,38,50,2Rxc5,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p1b5/2R5/5q2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',White takes.
1057,38,51,2Bxf3,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/2R5/5q2/3P1b2/PP3PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',This seems to me o be the obvious move but PMCA gives it as a mistake and suggests Qb4 27. Re5 Qxb2 28. Rxe8+ Bxe8 29. Qd2 Qb1+ 30. Qe1 Qxe1+ 31. Nxe1 Kf8 32. d4 Ke7 33. Nd3 Bc6 34. Nf4 Kd6 35. Nh5 g6 36. Nf6 h6 as the best continuation for Black.
1058,38,52,2gxf3,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/2R5/5q2/3P1P2/PP3P1P/3Q2K1 b - -',White's king side pawns are now split but Black has to be careful as her own back rank is weak for example if Re8-e6?? Rc5-c8 mating!
1059,38,53,2Qb4,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/2R5/1q6/3P1P2/PP3P1P/3Q2K1 w - -',With a double attack on the Rc5 and also threatening Re1 forking king and queen.
1060,38,54,2Rc1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/1q6/3P1P2/PP3P1P/2RQ2K1 b - -',So the rook drops back and White's pawns start to drop. PMCA gives 28. Qc2 h6 29. Rc8 Rxc8 30. Qxc8+ Kh7 31. Qf5+ Kg8 32. Qe5 Qa4 33. Kg2 Qxa2 34. Qe8+ Kh7 35. Qe4+ g6 36. Qxb7 Kg7 37. d4 as a better alternative but not many players would allow checks on e1.
1061,38,55,2Qxb2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3P1P2/Pq3P1P/2RQ2K1 w - -',So one pawn goes
1062,38,56,2Kg2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3P1P2/Pq3PKP/2RQ4 b - -',This doesn't seem to achieve much. PMCA gives 29. Rb1 Qxa2 30. Rxb7 Qd5 31. Ra7 Qg5+ 32. Kf1 Qh6 33. Kg2 Qg6+ 34. Kf1 Qh5 as better. At least White's deficit is held to just one pawn in this line! Another way to save the second pawn would have been Rc1-c2
1063,38,57,2Qxa2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3P1P2/q4PKP/2RQ4 w - -',Losing a second pawn makes things hard for White
1064,38,58,3Rc2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3P1P2/q1R2PKP/3Q4 b - -',White hits the queen but only to drive it to a better square
1065,38,59,3Qd5,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/3q4/8/3P1P2/2R2PKP/3Q4 w - -',It is nicely centralised here ready for action on either side of the board.
1066,38,60,3Qc1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/3q4/8/3P1P2/2R2PKP/2Q5 b - -',White just gives up a third pawn without a fight. PMCA gives 31. d4 b5 32. Re2 Rxe2 33. Qxe2 Kf8 34. Qc2 Qd6 35. Qxh7 Qxd4 36. Qc2 Qf6 37. Qc8+ Ke7 38. Qg4 Kd8 as better.
1067,38,61,3Qxd3,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/2R2PKP/2Q5 w - -',So white takes.
1068,38,62,3Rc8,b'2R1r1k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/5PKP/2Q5 b - -',This is the best counter-attacking hope.
1069,38,63,3Rd8,b'2Rr2k1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/5PKP/2Q5 w - -',Now Black blunders and gives up the advantage she has carefully secured. Qg6+ 33. Kh1 Qe6 34. Rc4 Qh3 35. Qd1 b5 36. Re4 Ra8 37. Re5 Qh4 38. Qd7 Rf8 39. Kg2 b4 40. Qc6 Qd4 41. Re7 is given as better by PMCA
1070,38,64,3Qc7,b'2Rr2k1/1pQ2ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/5PKP/8 b - -',White cleverly attacks the rook again.
1071,38,65,3Rf8,b'2R2rk1/1pQ2ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/5PKP/8 w - -',The rook seeks sanctuary.
1072,38,66,3Qb8,b'1QR2rk1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/3q1P2/5PKP/8 b - -',And White misses her big chance. She could have drawn with 34. Qc5 Rd8 35. Qc7 Qg6+ 36. Kh1 Qb1+ 37. Kg2 Qg6+
1073,38,67,3Qa3,b'1QR2rk1/1p3ppp/p7/8/8/q4P2/5PKP/8 w - -',Qg6+ 35. Kh1 Qb1+ 36. Kg2 Qb4 37. Rxf8+ Qxf8 38. Qxb7 a5 39. Qc6 g6 40. Kg3 Qb8+ 41. Kg2 Qb4 is given as even better for White in the PMCA
1074,38,68,3Qxb7,b'2R2rk1/1Q3ppp/p7/8/8/q4P2/5PKP/8 b - -',White now starts to get the pawns back.
1075,38,69,3Rxc8,b'2r3k1/1Q3ppp/p7/8/8/q4P2/5PKP/8 w - -',Black takes.
1076,38,70,3Qxc8+,b'2Q3k1/5ppp/p7/8/8/q4P2/5PKP/8 b - -',White takes back
1077,38,71,3Qf8,b'2Q2qk1/5ppp/p7/8/8/5P2/5PKP/8 w - -',Queen has to block
1078,38,72,3Qxa6,b'5qk1/5ppp/Q7/8/8/5P2/5PKP/8 b - -',Now the second pawn goes White has re-established material equality and Black's advantage is minimal and based on the split pawns on the kingside. White should be able to draw this.
1079,38,73,3Qd8,b'3q2k1/5ppp/Q7/8/8/5P2/5PKP/8 w - -',The queen improves her position
1080,38,74,3f4,b'3q2k1/5ppp/Q7/8/5P2/8/5PKP/8 b - -',White advances a pawn. As White I would be tempted to just sit on the position play something like Q-c4-g4 maybe h2-h3 and just wait for Black to come at me. I think the White queen belongs on the kingside protecting the king and pawns there.
1081,38,75,3g6,b'3q2k1/5p1p/Q5p1/8/5P2/8/5PKP/8 w - -',So Black avoids unpleasant back rank threats.
1082,38,76,3Kg3,b'3q2k1/5p1p/Q5p1/8/5P2/6K1/5P1P/8 b - -',King advances
1083,38,77,3Kg7,b'3q4/5pkp/Q5p1/8/5P2/6K1/5P1P/8 w - -',Black advances her king
1084,38,78,4h4,b'3q4/5pkp/Q5p1/8/5P1P/6K1/5P2/8 b - h3',I am not sure what this achieves. Qe2 seems better to me.
1085,38,79,4Kh6,b'3q4/5p1p/Q5pk/8/5P1P/6K1/5P2/8 w - -',Black wants to attack with the king supporting the queen.
1086,38,80,4f3,b'3q4/5p1p/Q5pk/8/5P1P/5PK1/8/8 b - -',This is a very poor move. PMCA gives 41. Qb7 f6 42. Qe4 Qd7 43. Qf3 Qd6 44. Qe3 Qd1 45. Qe7 Qg1+ 46. Kh3 Qf1+ 47. Kg3 Qd3+ 48. Qe3 Qd6 49. Qe8 as better but I like simply 41. Qe2 preventing the Black king from advancing. I don't see how Black can then make any more progress.
1087,38,81,4Kh5,b'3q4/5p1p/Q5p1/7k/5P1P/5PK1/8/8 w - -',Now Black starts to win pawns again.
1088,38,82,4Qb5+,b'3q4/5p1p/6p1/1Q5k/5P1P/5PK1/8/8 b - -',White throws in a check no doubt hoping for Kh6?? allowing Qg5!! and a draw. However Black has better.
1089,38,83,4f5,b'3q4/7p/6p1/1Q3p1k/5P1P/5PK1/8/8 w - f6',Now the h pawn is doomed and so is White.
1090,38,84,4Qe5,b'3q4/7p/6p1/4Qp1k/5P1P/5PK1/8/8 b - -',Probably best otherwise the f4 pawn goes too.
1091,38,85,4Qxh4+,b'8/7p/6p1/4Qp1k/5P1q/5PK1/8/8 w - -',So one pawn goes.
1092,38,86,4Kg2,b'8/7p/6p1/4Qp1k/5P1q/5P2/6K1/8 b - -',Forced!
1093,38,87,4Qd8,b'3q4/7p/6p1/4Qp1k/5P2/5P2/6K1/8 w - -',Queen goes back ready to strike down the d file or return to the kingside as required
1094,38,88,4Qg7,b'3q4/6Qp/6p1/5p1k/5P2/5P2/6K1/8 b - -',White hits the h7 pawn.
1095,38,89,4h6,b'3q4/6Q1/6pp/5p1k/5P2/5P2/6K1/8 w - -',Black protects.
1096,38,90,4Kh3,b'3q4/6Q1/6pp/5p1k/5P2/5P1K/8/8 b - -',Another blunder another pawn goes. PMCA gives 41. Qb7 f6 42. Qe4 Qd7 43. Qf3 Qd6 44. Qe3 Qd1 45. Qe7 Qg1+ 46. Kh3 Qf1+ 47. Kg3 Qd3+ 48. Qe3 Qd6 49. Qe8 although I would have probably played Qe5
1097,38,91,4Qh4+,b'8/6Q1/6pp/5p1k/5P1q/5P1K/8/8 w - -',So queen checks
1098,38,92,4Kg2,b'8/6Q1/6pp/5p1k/5P1q/5P2/6K1/8 b - -',Forced again
1099,38,93,4Qxf4,b'8/6Q1/6pp/5p1k/5q2/5P2/6K1/8 w - -',Another pawn goes.
1100,38,94,4Qa1,b'8/8/6pp/5p1k/5q2/5P2/6K1/Q7 b - -',Queen retreats
1101,38,95,4Qd2+,b'8/8/6pp/5p1k/8/5P2/3q2K1/Q7 w - -',Queen check
1102,38,96,4Kh3,b'8/8/6pp/5p1k/8/5P1K/3q4/Q7 b - -',King up
1103,38,97,4Qe2,b'8/8/6pp/5p1k/8/5P1K/4q3/Q7 w - -',Black attacks the pawn.
1104,38,98,5Qh1,b'8/8/6pp/5p1k/8/5P1K/4q3/7Q b - -',This is given as another mistake and PMCA suggests 50. Kg3 g5 51. Qh1+ Kg6 52. Qb1 Qe6 53. Qb7 h5 54. Qb1 h4+ 55. Kf2 Qd5 56. Qb8 Qe6 57. Qb1
1105,38,99,5f4,b'8/8/6pp/7k/5p2/5P1K/4q3/7Q w - -',White has no sensible moves and has the unenviable choice between losing a third pawn or allowing a queen exchange into a hopeless ending.
1106,38,100,5Qg2,b'8/8/6pp/7k/5p2/5P1K/4q1Q1/8 b - -',White allows the queen exchange.
1107,38,101,5Qxg2+,b'8/8/6pp/7k/5p2/5P1K/6q1/8 w - -',Black takes and White finally gives up. Many thanks for reading I hope you enjoyed it. Don't forget to rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!
1108,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The title is there for a reason; after a dubious opening from White a queen exchange leaves Black in a far better position and eventually a rook up after some careless moves on White's behalf. Whilst most would have given up White graciously fought back his material and remained a pawn down to the very end until Black himself made two costly careless errors at the end that cost him the win; White escapes with an entertaining draw.
1109,39,1,Bxb5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p7/1B1P4/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',? Incredibly strange sacrifice. Normally 7. Be2 is the better continuation. White will be behind until the end of the match.
1110,39,2,1Qxf6,b'4kbnr/2pp1ppp/b4Q2/1p1P4/r3P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQk -',Trying to take queens to get a better chance in the middlegame. 11. Qe3 is the better option here.

1112,39,4,1Nc3,b'4kb1r/2pp1ppp/b4n2/1p1P4/r3P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',White misses to hold his pawns with 12. f3 which clamp down strongly. Then 12...Rc4 13. c3 Ra4 gives Black a small edge but White avoids some danger.
1113,39,5,1Bb4,b'4k2r/2pp1ppp/b4n2/1p1P4/rb2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',Trying to win the e4 pawn but 12...Rc4! places the rook firmly in position as well as attacking White's weakened queenside.
1114,39,6,1O-O,b'4k2r/2pp1ppp/b4n2/1p1P4/rb2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',White still misses 13. f3. Now Black takes control.
1115,39,7,1Kxf1,b'4k2r/2pp1ppp/8/8/1p2r3/PRn1B3/2P2PPP/5K2 b k -',Considering White is a whole rook down most would have resigned by now but the next few moves turn the tables dramatically. 
1116,39,8,Nc2,b'4k2r/2pp1ppp/8/8/4r3/1RP1B3/2n2PPP/5K2 w k -',Ruh Roh! The double whammy 21...Nc6! both protects the knight and the threat of Rb8+. Now White gets a rook back. 
1117,39,9,Rxe3,b'7R/2ppkppp/8/8/8/2P1r3/6PP/5K2 w - -',White has now limited the damage to two pawns but you would still think Black has enough resources to eventually win. 
1118,39,10,Rxc3,b'8/2ppkppR/8/8/8/2r5/6PP/5K2 w - -',A slight inaccuracy. There was no way White was going to defend that pawn so 25...Kf6 stomps the counter-capture of g7. 
1119,39,11,2Rxg7,b'8/2ppkpR1/8/8/8/2r5/6PP/5K2 b - -',Now White has worked his way back from a rook and pawn down to a pawn. Incredible!
1120,39,12,3h5,b'8/8/8/2p1kp1P/3p4/2r5/4K1P1/5R2 b - -',White hopes that the distraction of the h-pawn combined with the protection of the h3 square nullifies Black's king. However White's rook is tied down to that defense and the rook and two pawns will eventually overpower the white king.
1121,39,13,3Kd2,b'8/8/8/2p1kp1P/3p4/4r3/3K2P1/5R2 b - -',After defending with utmost care White intends on trying to hold the pawns down but better was 33. Kf2 when White will still have counter play and better chances. 
1122,39,14,3c4,b'8/8/8/4kp1P/2pp4/4r3/3K2P1/5R2 w - -',Probably better here was 33...Rg3. 
1123,39,15,3h7,b'8/7P/5k2/5p2/3p4/2p1r3/6P1/2K2R2 b - -',With this move White throws away his chances. 36. Rh1 was probably better but in the long run Black should win in the end.
1124,39,16,Kxh7,b'8/7k/8/5R2/3p4/2p1r3/6P1/2K5 w - -',Probably not best; pushing the pawns with 37...d3 easily give a clear-cut win. However with sensible play Black should still win.
1125,39,17,3Rf2,b'8/7k/8/8/3p4/2p1r3/5RP1/2K5 b - -',Another mistake. 38. Rc5 offers better hope although Black should eventually win.
1126,39,18,3Rf1,b'8/7k/8/8/8/2ppr3/6P1/2K2R2 b - -',Another bad error; 39. Kd1 will hold out longer but Black will eventually force a win with his passed pawns.
1127,39,19,3c2,b'8/7k/8/8/8/3pr3/2p3P1/2K2R2 w - -',Phenomenal after concise attack Black makes a crucial mistake; 39...Re2! wins eventually. 
1128,39,20,Rxg2+,b'8/8/6k1/8/8/3p4/2pK2r1/5R2 w - -',And so Black gives up the remaining of his advantage. 42...Kg7 would keep a small advantage in the hope that White would blunder at some point. White will now draw.
1129,39,21,4Kxc2,b'8/8/8/8/5k2/8/2K5/8 b - -',An amazing comeback! White draws at level material.
