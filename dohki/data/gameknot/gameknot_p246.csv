e4 is the most usual opening move for white. After e4 both your queen and your bishop can move out from the back rank. Getting the pieces out will be one of your main goals during the opening. They cannot do much good while they are in the back rank.

Another feature of e4 is that it gives you presence in the center. Presence in the center is desirable because most pieces have are stronger here. A knight in the center can move to 8 squares while one in the corner can only move to 2. A bishop in the center can move to 15 squares while one on the back rank can move to 7. Because of this if one player controls the center he has an advantage. If you have more legal moves it is more likely that one of them can give you an advantage."

If I take it with the bishop you will be checked. As you can just retake with the king it is not dangerous yet. However you must watch that square carefully. If I ever attack it with a second piece you must do something.

Actually I made a blunder in the last move and you could have won a pawn. 4. Nxe5 Nxe5 5. d4 - and the white d-pawn attacks both my Knight and my Bishop. I can only save one of them which means white gets his knight back (bishops and knights are about the same value). But white do keep the extra pawn his knight grabbed.

When one piece attacks two other more valuable or underprotected pieces in the this pawn does it is called a fork. The fork is a very important idea in chess tactics.

All pieces even the king can fork other pieces. It is a good exercise to put different pieces on the board and try to create forks. If you can consistently spot forking opportunities (both your own and those of your opponent) you have reached an important first step in mastering tactics. Especially tricky to spot both for you and the opponent are knight forks. This is because of the way the knight moves. If you have a chess board you can put the knight on each square one by one and tap all the squares it can move to. If you do this for a few minutes every day until you instantly ""see"" where the knight can move it will enable you to spot knight forks much more easily."

As the start of an attack on the queen side the move has more merit though. You have developed all your pieces and it is time to have an offensive plan for the middle game.

On the downside the knight on c3 is now only protected by the bishop on b2. As the knight is attacked by my bishop your b2 bishop must keep guarding the knight unil the knight moves or gets alternative protection.
If the intention of your move was to free up the knight so it can continue your advance on the queen side it does make sense.

259,12,6,1Qg4,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppN/4pb1p/8/3P2Q1/3B4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',"I could at the time see 2 options. One was to blunt the queen's attack line with 12...g6 and after 13.Nxf6 Qxf6 White has no attack left. Or I could have played a ""waiting move"" - I had 12...Bd7 in mind - and Black's position is sound."
260,12,7,1Bxg6,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2p1N/4pbBp/8/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Ah. Perhaps I should have gone for the waiting move. White's queen has an unobstructed attack line so I decided to take the bishop which would give me a win IF White's attack failed.
261,12,8,Kh8,b'r1bqr2k/ppp4N/4pbQp/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',My only move.

264,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  Here is another game from Beefyness's tourney which I lost.  I am calling this game an Expert Lesson because although my opponent's current rating is 1899 he had an optimum rating of 2076 therefore once an Expert always an Expert!  This time I fell to a basic tactic the skewer.  An inappropritate pawn push from me set it all up!
265,13,1,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4. Ba4 - white prefers to decline exchanging on c6 like in the Beafyness game - it still puts pressure on my c6 knight though!
266,13,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4.  ......... Nf6 - black puts pressure on e4 by playing the Morphy Defense.
267,13,3,Bb3,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',7. Bb3 - black tries to get play on the queenside by driving back white's lsb.  These queenside pawns can become weak however as will be seen in this game.
268,13,4,Na5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',9. ........ Na5 - tries to get rid of the bishop pin on f7 by either forcing an exchange or driving the lsb back to c2.
269,13,5,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - c6',10. ......... c5 - black has a lead in development here and an impressive looking pawn centre.  Ah!  Dave now shows me just how I should have played in my game with Coach Ion which started out as a Bishop's Opening an Expert Lesson in Pawn Centres.  PLAY D4!!  This move CONTESTS black's impressive pawn wall BIG TIME!!
270,13,6,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/5N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',13. ......... Nc6 - see how that pawn centre has fragmented.  If I take on d4 my d pawn will be left as an isolani.
271,13,7,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/2np1n2/pp2p3/3PP3/1N2BN1P/PPB2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',15. Be3 - and now here is how to catch up with slow development as white in this opening!
272,13,8,1Nbd2,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/2np1n2/1p2p3/p2PP3/4BN1P/PPBN1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',16. Nbd2 - the queen knight is driven back but not for long!
273,13,9,2Bxd4,b'r3r1k1/1q1bbppp/3p1n2/1p6/p2BP3/3B3P/PP1NQPP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',21. Bxd4 - oops I exchanged on d4 after all.  But this was a very popular exchange in the World Database only slightly favourable to white.  There were still other options though so maybe I should have chosen another.
274,13,10,2axb3,b'2r1r1k1/1q1bbppp/3p1n2/1p6/3BP3/1P1B3P/3NQPP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',23. axb3 - now the b5 pawn is left as an isolani.  It is also doubly attacked by white's lsb and the Wicked Witch of the West.
275,13,11,2b4,b'2r1r1k1/1q1bbppp/3p1n2/8/1p1BP3/1P1B3P/3NQPP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',"23.  ........ b4?? - the object of this move was to move my b pawn out of the way before exchanging both pairs of rooks and dominating the a file with Glenda as one of the defenders of that pawn would be displaced and that pawn would be lost.  This was Dave's suggestion in the chat in our next game which may well appear in the public gallery too!  Dave said ""I think my plan B would either be ...d5 to open up your black sq B.  The pawn on b5 doesn't need to move as it has enough protection for now.  You could also play ...Ra8 and attack down the a file either before or after the exchange of rooks.""  This move now allows a nasty exchange winning skewer with 24. Ba6."
276,13,12,Qxc8,b'2q3k1/3bbppp/3p1n2/8/1p1BP3/1P5P/3NQPP1/4R1K1 w - -',"26. .......... Qxc8 - After the loss of the exchange I play on for a few more moves hoping to get a perpetual that did not materialise so I waved the white flag on move 32 after white blocked Glenda's spite check on c1.  What is the lesson here?  Do check and double check the effect a line opening move can have and if it does allow a tactic do make sure you can wriggle out of it otherwise PRESS THE RESET BUTTON!

Cheers - Joanne"

278,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',e4. Ah my favorite opening. *cough* stupid d4... *cough*
279,14,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I think this is hypermodern. But the more normal response would have been 1. ... b6.
280,14,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Gain central space.
281,14,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Fianchetto-ing the bishop. All standard play here.
282,14,4,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Developing normally. A lot of times in hypermodern stuff they try to pin the knight or something and pick up a central pawn.
283,14,5,Nc3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I thought about d5 because then after  4. d5 Ne5 5. Nxe5 Bxe5 6. f4 I would have a lot of board control but in doing so I would weaken my king side and open up the long diagonal for his dark squared bishop. This maily develops protects e4 for the future and just gain more central space.
284,14,6,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now d5 isn't really an option unless I did some weird line that I thought about at the time but can not remember it at all right now. It had something to do with Qd2 then d5 then after exd5 i play exd5 winning the knight and/or bishop.
285,14,7,Bc4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',After this move i knew that ... d5 would come sooner or later.
286,14,8,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n1pnp1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? At the local tournaments I go to there is a person who plays hypermodern pretty much all the time. He is the only one there who ever does play it by the way. Whenever i play him he always develops his knight on the fianchettoed side to the seventh rank. By going Nf6 he blocks his bishops and loses a tempo.
287,14,9,Ng8,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/4P3/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Poor knight e8 and d7 weren't even options. =( the knight must be all sad face. Now i have both of his bishops kind of boxed in although he can always fianchetto his LSB.
288,14,10,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/4P3/2BP4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Preparing Qd2 with standard kingside pawn attack. however he could always castle queenside but then i would still have the minority pawn push.
289,14,11,d5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n1p1p1/3pP3/2BP4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq d6',Saw it coming.

291,14,13,Na5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/4p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Woops.

293,14,15,c6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/B2P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',best option

295,14,17,1Ne7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Now his knight gets the right idea. My LSB isn't going anywhere so he can ignore it for the time being.
296,14,18,Nf5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pPn2/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Moving to a more useful square? Trying to trade off the bishop? No idea.
297,14,19,1Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pPnB1/3P4/1BN2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I like my bishop though. I thought about Bf4 but there my bishop isn't useful. I was also looking at g4 to start the beginning of a king side pawn rush.
298,14,20,1Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/ppq2pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pPnB1/3P4/1BN2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Quick story time: I sometimes will be able to look 7 to 15 moves ahead and make the right decisions. this happens rarely though. With my ADHD most of the time i look ahead anywhere from 3 - 5 moves. I don't like long games cause i can get bored... Here i was expecting 12. ... f6 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6. My line of thinking went like this: I trade off his black squared bishop. yay! But then he is less cramped. A LOT less cramped. In the end this helped immensely.
299,14,21,1g4,b'r1b1k2r/ppq2pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pPnB1/3P2P1/1BN2N2/PPPQ1P1P/R3K2R b KQkq g3',Bye bye Knight. Back to standing in front of the king!

301,14,23,1axb3,b'r1b1k2r/ppq2pbp/2p1p1p1/3pPnB1/3P2P1/1PN2N2/1PPQ1P1P/R3K2R b KQkq -',I took a minute here trying to decide which pawn i should take with. If i did castle queen side which i still planned on doing i would have an open king if i took with the c pawn. I could always move to b1 but i would still be open. with the a pawn though when i castle i can move the king to b1 and i would be much more safe.

Qxd8 Rxd8 9 Bg5 when he reckoned 9... Re8 is best but difficult to find if you do not know the line.  I avoided it because I do not like swapping Queens early in the game.  6...Bg4 would have avoided trapping my Bishop in - unless I play vigorously from here on I get a very cramped position.

This move shuts off the White QB and allows me to build up unmolested.  In view of what happens later White should have taken on f5 or played 10 Bg5.

I felt that any pawn move in front of his King should now prove fatal but how was I going to prove it?

A bolt from the blue... but one that Bob must have planned well in advance: his queen being otherwise imperilled."" John credited me with too much foresight but I do love this move inspired as it was by Nigel Short's Bishop sacrifice on f2 in his 17th game against Kasparov which I had witnessed live at the Savoy.
I felt a Rook sac might be on maybe when the Bishop came to f1 but it would be too well covered by White's Rooks and I was still undeveloped on my Queen side so I could not bring my other Rook into the attack.  Then I saw that if I could entice the King away from h2 the pawns fell and White's King might get mated.  So I looked at Rf2.  With the threat of mate on h2 White had to take.  Even if the King didn't get mated I should recover the piece when White had to block check on f3... Incidentally when I played through the game on my computer it played Rf2 instantly.

Among user of this repertoire including Fischer Kasparov and many others in their early years. Some say nuisance of playing this move as it not directly motivating on controlling the centre but they need to know white motive here is to strengthen e4 and to pursue pawns march toward kingside.

In normal french (Advance) winawer is a quite a weapon for black. But in this game I don't think it was appropriate as it lost tempo. It seem to be a dubious move.

I get a seemingly reasonable position as white but then a pawn push on the queenside pushes my pieces back and later on black has a decisive pawn majority which nets him a passed pawn.  I try to get my pieces to pile up on it but I do not get the chance to take it free of charge.  The position of the black rook and the Wicked Witch of the West provide the final denouement for me.  I decide to kick off with d4 as I played e4 against him in a recent unrated game and lost so I thought I would mix things up.

Just to let you know that this is round 2 against dynamic_dv the guy who skewered Glenda to one of my castles in ""An Expert Lesson in Tactics"".  This game was a classic Sicilian game in which both sides castled on opposite sides and when that happens this means a race involving pawn storms and heavies behind them.  Whoever gets behind in tempo here usually cops Old Matey.  I thought I had a strong attack indeed it seemed that I had won a pawn.  But a strong move by the Wicked Witch of the West put paid to all that and I ended up being a pawn down and in the final position having to give up a second pawn to a knockout combo.

If the b pawn had still been on the board I could have blocked this bishop move.  My rook must move away allowing Frere Lenoir to be taken.  If Henry moves to c1 to try and get two pieces for the rook then Rc5 simply drives Henry back to b1 and the rook falls next move.  Any rook move will result in Frere Lenoir being taken with check and I could well lose a third pawn and his rook will be a bone in the throat.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  A sad end to a game of which I had high hopes.

For example 6...d6 7. Ne6. Black must lose the Queen to avoid mate.
e6 or e5 seems better for Black but is still clearly a compromised position for Black.

800,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone I decided to join an Expert's tournament.  The player's ratings ranged from 1899 - 2430 (the 1899 player was at one time an Expert).  This is the game against the 2400  player an International Master and the result well you might have guessed another loss!  Well you could say this is all good experience!  Read on ....

I do play the Gligoric but I did bear in mind my Expert Lesson in K & P endings against Paolo (remember that annotated game all?) and this time kept one minor piece on the board but I still lost.
802,38,2,Nb3,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p4p2/2p5/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',8. Nb3 - unlike the Paolo game the knight moves to b3 this time!  The queen trade still happens next move though.

Rdxc5 - up until here I have been using the World Database but I have been making decisions as to what I thought was best for me.  However I overlooked this pawn capture.  I kicked myself for making such a basic oversight but I consoled myself with the fact that about 2 or 3 Experts made the same error.  Bxb2 is out of the question due to Rxc2 !
806,38,6,1Rd7,b'2k4r/2pr2pp/p4p2/PpR1b3/4P3/1P2BP2/1P4PP/2R3K1 w - -',"19. ......... Rd7?? - Beafyness asked me why I played that move and I responded:-

To prepare Bxb2. If an immediate Bxb2 then Rxc2 . 

beefyness then said ""ok but pointless as Rc2 kills the attack better was Rd3 attacking e3 & b3 19..Rd3 20 f4. Bd6 21 Rd5. Rxe3. Not 21 Kf2(protecting the bishop). Rxb3 22 Rc1-c2. Rb3xb2 22 Rc5xc7  Be5xc7 23 Rc2xb2 Rh8-d8 and you wrestle control of the centre column. It was my feeling at that this was the point you went on the defensive 
19...Rd3 20.f4 Bd6 21. Rc5-c3 Re3 22. Rxe3 Bxf4 is also good for black
- so maybe the 3 other experts didn't make such a bad error it was probably 19. Rd7? that did the damage! "

814,38,14,Ke7,b'8/4k3/p1p1P1KB/bp6/7P/1P6/1P4P1/8 w - -',42. ......... Ke7 - one of the pawns must be blockaded.
815,38,15,Bxb2,b'4k3/8/p1p1P2P/1p3KB1/8/1P6/1b4P1/8 w - -',46. ........ Bxb2 - I have the satisfaction of removing white's b pawn but it is too late next move white plays his bishop to f6 screening out Frere Lenoir from h8.  White's bishop is backed up by his king.  There is no way I can stop white from crowning one of his passers so I waved the white flag.   Thankfully the loss was just 0.3 points.   I just hope I can put up a better show against him in my return challenge as white.  Cheers everyone!  Joanne
