35,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Petrosian's move of choice. His style looks similar to Botvinnik but unlike his great predecessor Petrosian had a very deep tactical vision.
36,3,1,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black wants to play a Semi-Slav or the very Sharp Botvinnik variation.
37,3,2,Qc2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PPQ1PPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',White develops his Queen early which is not uncommon in the QGD. This square is particularly useful is you plan on exchanging on d5 and preventing an early Bishop sortie to f5.
38,3,3,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black wants to resolve the pin. This is usually a good move since in some lines there are some tactics on h7 winning that pawn. There is a small downside however in case White plays the exchange variation and castles long the h-pawn might speed up White's pawn storm on the K-side. There are many subtleties like this in the QGD and it's very difficult to spot them if you don't have enough experience with the opening. Memorizing lines isn't enough.
39,3,4,Bf4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The most elastic move. White doesn't want to hand over the Bishop pair so early on in the game and he doesn't want to retreat to h4 which would make Black's task of equalizing easier since he would enter normal positions of the Orthodox Defense where White's Queen isn't optimally placed on c2.
40,3,5,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',A very normal move and it's very hard to find anything else for Black. The problem is that once this Knight has developed White can take with much more confidence on d5 since taking with the e-pawn leads to normal positions where White can choose between the minority attack and castling long while taking with the c-pawn is inferior because the Bc8 is still a problem and c6 isn't available for the Knight.
41,3,6,cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3P4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Waiting no more White exchanges on d5. The exchange variation of the QGD is a very dangerous weapon especially in the hands of a strategist like Petrosian.
42,3,7,cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/3p4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Unzicker was fearful of normal structures that would have resulted after recapturing with the e-pawn after which the Qc2 and the Bf4 make perfect sense so he recaptures with the c-pawn. White is unable to play the minority attack nor is castling long a good alternative. The problem is that Black doesn't have a good plan himself in this structure. Let's examine the other two possible recaptures. Taking with the e-pawn can lead to the following sequence of moves 9...exd5 10. h3 (preserving the Bf4 and preparing the pawn storm) Re8 (the standard plan for Black who doesn't have many squares to shuffles pieces around) 11. Bd3 (one of the reasons why The Exchange variation is good for White is that his pieces develop on optimal squares) Nf8 (making room for the Bc8 to come into play) 12. 0-0-0 (burning all bridges but thanks to Black's 7th White can be optimist he'll crash through first). I guess this was the position Black wanted to avoid in recapturing with the c-pawn. But there is another recapture possible with the Knight. After 9...Nxd5 10. Nxd5! exd5 11. Bd3 White can play his second plan the minority attack which is very hard to meet and the missing pair of Knights favor White because Black has fewer attacking chances.
43,3,8,1Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Normal development. White's plan in this position is to use the c-file for infiltration and reduce Black's counterplay to zero. 
44,3,9,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',A strategical error. Never move pawns on the flank where you are weaker and this game proves it tenfold. The reason behind this statement is that any pawn moves create weaknesses and your opponent will have something to target. However it's very difficult to find a working plan for Black Unzicker must have been wanted to prevent Nb5 and try to resolve his Bc8 somehow.
45,3,10,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White is in no hurry Black can't contest the c-file any time soon. 11. h3 would have been an alternative but Petrosian must have not been afraid of losing the Bishop pair and wasn't in a hurry to weaken his castled position.
46,3,11,1b5,b'r1bq1rk1/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/1p1p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - b6',Would you believe that after this move Black is lost? He has just created permanent weak spots on the c-file while giving his opponent a target in the b-pawn. The only sensible looking alternative was 11...Nh5 but even after that White has the strong reply 12. Be5! Nxe5 (12...f6 fails to 13. Nxd5! fxe5 (13...exd5 loses after 14. Bh7+ Kh8 15. Bc7 Qe8 16. Bg6 Rf7 17. Bxh5 and White has won the piece back and will soon win the exchange as well) 14. Nc7 exd4 15. Nxd4 Ne5 16. Bh7+ Kh8 17. Nxa8 these tactical variations show the hidden dangers in Black's cramped position) 13. dxe5 and Black has two bad pieces the Bc8 and the Nh5.

48,3,13,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/Pp1P1B2/2NBPN2/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Forced or else Black loses a pawn. He can't afford to open the a-file because the a-pawn will be very weak and cannot stand for long.
49,3,14,1Na2,b'r1bq1rk1/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/Pp1P1B2/3BPN2/NPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Stronger than 13. Ne2 this Knight is heading towards b3.
50,3,15,1Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/3nbpp1/p3p2p/3p4/Pp1P1B2/3BPN2/NPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Perhaps not the most active plan of defense mainly because White could have played 14. a5! and the pawn is immune because of Qc8. But both these players had already formulated the plans after which they would arrange their pieces and were staying on-course. 
51,3,16,1Nc1,b'r1bqnrk1/3nbpp1/p3p2p/3p4/Pp1P1B2/3BPN2/1PQ2PPP/R1N2RK1 b - -',Consistent to the previous move.

62,3,27,2Rac1,b'3q1rk1/r2n1pp1/3bp2p/p2p4/Pp1P4/1N1QPN2/1PR2PPP/2R3K1 b - -',White has doubled Rooks and now must start attacking. Generally if your only advantage is an open file then that won't be enough to secure victory. Your opponent will either find a way to exchange Rooks and simply defend everything. So from a strategic viewpoint once you have an open file it's time to create new targets of attack or at least provoke your opponent into creating weaknesses that he can't defend. Look at this position. White stands better but he isn't winning. There are no concrete targets to attack. Black has a small space advantage on the Q-side which is enough for him to regroup his pieces and defend albeit passively. White has to use the dominance on the c-file in other ways.  
63,3,28,2Nb6,b'3q1rk1/r4pp1/1n1bp2p/p2p4/Pp1P4/1N1QPN2/1PR2PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Aiming for c4 and attacking a4. Since controlling the c4 square with a pawn is possible only by removing the blockading Nb3 White contests it with a piece.
64,3,29,2Qb5,b'3q1rk1/r4pp1/1n1bp2p/pQ1p4/Pp1P4/1N2PN2/1PR2PPP/2R3K1 b - -',Since Black doesn't have his LSB anymore the light squares are the perfect point to infiltrate on the Q-side.
65,3,30,2Nfd2,b'3q1rk1/r4pp1/3bp2p/pQ1p4/PpnP4/1N2P3/1PRN1PPP/2R3K1 b - -',This Knight wasn't very active on f3 so White exchanges it off.
66,3,31,2Nxd2,b'3q1rk1/r4pp1/3bp2p/pQ1p4/Pp1P4/1N2P3/1PRn1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Retreating would have meant loss of all prospects for this Knight so Unzicker rightly swaps it off. Sometimes it's better to exchange pieces even if your position is worse than retreating that piece to a passive square.

68,3,33,2Qa8,b'q4rk1/r4pp1/3bp2p/pQ1p4/Pp1P4/1N2P3/1P1R1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Black's alternative defense plan would be to exchange Queens and go for a passive defense while allowing White his supremacy on the c-file. This might have put a more stubborn resistance but very few players like passive positions. 
69,3,34,2Rc2c6,b'q2r2k1/r4pp1/2Rbp2p/pQ1p4/Pp1P4/1N2P3/1P3PPP/2R3K1 b - -',White can't win anything on the Q-side. Black can defend everything and he's not going to run out of moves. So it's time to change the plan.
70,3,35,3h4,b'q2r1k2/r4p2/2Rbp1pp/pQ1p4/Pp1P3P/1N2P1P1/1P3P2/2R2K2 b - h3',First placing all the K-side pawns on the same color as his opponent's Bishop. This is an important point in endgames where many beginners place their pawns on opposite color squares so that the pawns will be safe from capture. This is a mistake with one notable exception opposite color Bishop endings because you want to use your pawns to restrict the Bishop's movement. Petrosian knew this and moved his pawns accordingly.
71,3,36,3h5,b'q2r1k2/r4p2/2Rbp1p1/pQ1p3p/Pp1P3P/1N2P1P1/1P3P2/2R2K2 w - -',Unzicker knew this as well and move his pawns to the opposite color squares as his Bishop so that the pawns will control the light squares and his Bishop the dark ones.

So he rightfully judged that he can move his King to the Q-side where it will be perfectly safe and start attacking on the K-side. Black doesn't have that option since his King wouldn't make it past the c-file. A brilliant concept by Petrosian and something to remember in case you run out of ideas.
73,3,38,Kg8,b'q2r2k1/r4p2/2Rbp1p1/pQ1p3p/Pp1P3P/1N2P1P1/1PR2P2/4K3 w - -',Not that Black can't start active plans because Petrosian has placed all his pieces on optimal squares to prevent this. All he can do is sit and watch the march of the White King knowing undoubtedly what is coming next.

Many modern Grandmasters would have lost their temper by now and blundered away their position. But in those days defending was an art alongside attacking.

Not too many people understand this opening but I have used it on several occasions and see scenarios where it works and situations where it doesn't. One thing I am confused do most games end up in a draw with this opening or is there an advantage to one color and why?

I know black bishop is cut off but I usually don't mind this as the game usually develops into a situation in which this bishop becomes very useful.

196,9,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Simple. I am just doing textbook strategy. The white bishop is still not developed so it seems as if I am ahead. Wonder if I castle too early or is the main goal here to get the king into a protected position by castling this early? Any feedback here would be appreciated.

203,9,12,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4N1b1/2P1Q3/7P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R b KQ -',?? - I seriously think the bishop was a better option. Or better yet why trade when down a pawn? Perhaps Nbd2(?) was a better option? Or even Be2 giving white king a protection route to castle. 
204,9,13,1dxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4p1b1/2P1Q3/7P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R w KQ -',! - Confirming my grasp on the central position. Both bishop is protected and pawn can't be taken. Removing the knights really opened the board which can be good or bad for black.
205,9,14,1Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4p1b1/2P1Q3/7P/PP1N1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ -',?? - FATAL miscalculation. Perhaps thinking of queen-side castle to try and regain central position? White is way too open to even think of trying this. 11. Bd3 to allow the king to reenter a closed protected area by castling kingside. This BAD miscalculation costs black dearly.

So far I have a 100% win record in games with this line; partly because the move considered White's best response 6. Bf1 is simply never found at the board by players who haven't seen it before. The point of this bizarre retreat is to guard g2 and to preserve the bishop from exchange (either 6. Be2 or 6. Bb3 is met by Nd4); and Black still has to deal with the threat to his knight. Since both 6... Nxd5 7. Bxb5 and 6... Qxd5 7. Nc3 are fine for White Black normally plays 6... Nd4 transposing into the labyrinthine Fritz variation.

Of course Black would not exchange but would play 8... e4; however the long diagonal would at least then be blocked.

It looks as though this defence is ineffective the d-pawn being pinned against the queen but in one game in the database Black unwisely tried 12... e4 and regretted it after 13. fxe4 Nxe4 14. Qg4+.

White clearly can't aim to counter Black's pawn storm with one of his own as his pawns are too far behind. Instead I suspect the intention was 17. b4 Bb6 18. b5 to kick Black's queen off the long diagonal. A nice idea but too slow; Black just responds Qg6 and Grond crawls on. What can be recommended instead? Perhaps 16. Ne2 getting another defender to the kingside and creating the possibility of blocking one of Black's lines by d4.

Now the enemy are at the gates and the Rohirrim are nowhere in sight. The immediate threat is 17... gxf3 18. gxf3 Qxf3+ 19. Qxf3 Bxf3#; White could instead play 18. g3 but then the knight is frozen in place and Black can easily break open White's kingside by advancing the f- and h-pawns. The only way to defend f3 (remember it can't move) is to move the f2 knight; but it has no squares. 17. Nh3 gxh3 also undermines g2 and leads to checkmate while 17. Nxg4 fxg4? 18. Ne4 would dampen Black's attack but instead 17... Rxg4 and White can't take the rook.

Here is a razor sharp game against Expert Nyctalop.  Nyctalop has kindly commented on my previous annotations so I thought I would try my luck against him.  I tried to attack but it was rebuffed big time.  The story starts with a Scilian Defense. 1. e4  c5."
781,32,1,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - fairly standard play so far.
782,32,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nc3 - it is considered bad play to play Nxc6 as bxc6 allows black to build up a pawn centre.  Mind you I did do this exchange in an OTB friendly against a player with an 1824 rating way back in 1999 and went on to win in spectacular fashion.  Sadly I did not notate that game but it is in my memory - my rating was 1240!  Still I decided not to chance it here and play Nc3 - a developing move which defends the pawn on e4.

797,32,17,Rc8,b'2r3k1/5pPp/p2p4/3Pn3/8/1Bq5/Pp4PP/3Q1R1K w - -',"28. ..... Rc8 - I decided to wave the white flag here as I have no defense to Qc1.  There would follow something like this Variation A

29. h3 Qc1 
30. Qxc1 Rxc1 
31. Rxc1 bxc1=Q+ 

Or just a little bit worse ......

Variation B

29. Qb1 Qc1
