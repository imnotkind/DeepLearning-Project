I imagine he'll play Rd2 to keep me from playing Re2 and also to prepare to double the knights. So I'll have to move my knight after that -- maybe to b4. And after that after we trade rooks maybe to d3. And it's safe from a pin (Rd1) because I'd be able to play Nf4+ and win the rook."

After the exchanges that follow White takes c6 and Black is forced to trap one rook on the back rank defending the pawn on e6 - because with the c- and e-pawns out of the way White has an excellent shot at promoting their own d- and/or e-pawn effectively ending the game. Better is 18...Rc8.

True that knight can be exchanged but as per my previous note I am a piece up and want to exchange my opponent down to nothing.  Fou Lenoir can always act as a giant pawn here and hold up that e5 passer. My opponent decided to move his lsb instead.

547,35,18,3Kf1,b'6k1/3bbppp/3p4/3Pp3/pP6/P3B2P/5PP1/5K2 b - -',33. Kf1 - white moves his king towards the centre very sensible idea in the endgame but it will avail him nought.

552,35,23,Bh4+,b'6k1/5ppp/8/3pp3/pPb3Pb/P3BP1P/8/4K3 w - -',38. ..... Bh4+ - yup what about Fou Lenoir well here is the answer he forms a neat criss-cross with his twin brother keeping the enemy king from the kingside.  His remaining bishop is going to be very passive very soon.

Fast asleep on g8 he has been from move 8 - it is now move 40 - disgraceful - I'm not having this.   I set his alarm clock for next turn.  Time he woke up and got out of his pit!
555,35,26,Kf8,b'5k2/5ppp/8/4p3/pPbp2P1/P4PbP/8/3K2B1 w - -',41. ...... Kf8 - The alarm clock sounds and Henry now emerges from his pit.  He fancies his usual prawns on toast and there are three juicy ones on the kingside to be picked off at leisure as the white king cannot get to the kingside and the white dsb cannot help either.  White sees what is coming and waves the white flag.  For me a final position like this is a dream come true.

557,36,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays a generic flexible defence known as the Indian Defence which may branch out into any of many defences including King's Indian Defence Benoni Gruenfeld Nimzo-Indian Defence and many others. The main advantage for Black here is that he can more or less completely choose which opening to use.
558,36,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"White plays the main line to use against most ""Indian"" defences."

560,36,4,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I play the Classical Variation the most popular choice here for White. White does not want to clog up his pawn structure after 4...Bxc3 5.bxc3 so he prepares to recapture with his queen. The main drawback here is that White must waste a few tempi to recapture with his queen allowing Black a slight lead in minor piece development.
561,36,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',Known as the Adorjan Gambit and by far the most popular option in the GK database. Statistics show a very slight edge for Black.

However I prefer 5.Nf3 because it develops a piece which will dilute Black's advantage in development after the inevitable ...Bxc3 .Qxc3 is finally played. Soon however White must challenge Black's bishop with .a3.

It is a gambit move since .dxc5 Bxc5 loses a tempo and allows White to get rid of the annoying pin: therefore Black should not immediately regain the pawn. I usually play dxc5 at whichever stage Black plays ...c5 because firstly I hope that if Black is a weak player he will play ...Bxc5 - obviously not the case here. Secondly I hope to slow Black down in the hassle he must undertake with his knight to regain the pawn.

Black's pieces are threatening superiority on my queenside and are both very well-placed. Time to get rid of one of them. Obviously 8...Ba5? 9.b4! loses material so Black has only one move here.

Black is defending the f6-knight with another knight so exchanging on d6 will give me no advantage and in fact be very slightly worse for me as I am losing bishop for knight in an open position. And 10.b4 no longer gains a tempo.

Each player is simply and effectively defusing the other player's minor threats and advantages but neither has actually made any attempts to gain a decisive advantage.

I've never been sure about this and in fact I don't see how it would be possible. Surely for at least the first few moves things are dictated by what your opponent does. Okay then here's the plan. Somehow I'm going to win but the downside is that so far I have no idea how this will be done. I got a little bored by e5 as a response to e4 so I'm experimenting along the c file. I have used c5 a few times but I think here I will have a look at c6. Both of which are with the idea of taking a chunk out of the centre if possible.
583,37,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',no threats so why not take more of the middle! in these games have found it hard to maintain these two pawns but it's worth it.
584,37,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I would have played 2.d4 too so no complaints so far. I feel my next has to be 2.d5 otherwise I would be giving away far too much of the centre. I'm thinking now that c6 is not the best response to 1.e4 . I have refined the plan slightly. What I'm going to do is watch my opponents early moves carefully to see if I can spot any stray moves which might give me a chance to seize the initiative. So you see already the plan is taking shape.

I have been looking around here for a decent move and I would like to play d5 to try to get a foothold on the centre and also prepare the way for some movement in my king side pieces. However I feel that before I can do that 4Nd7 has to be played. Note the way this neatly boxes in my light bishop. I will have to try to sort that problem out as we go along."
589,37,8,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/2BPN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',first off there is no immediate threat on either my pawn or knight so i'm happy to leave them hanging in the very short term since there are a few options for backing them up. you playing f5 would be a hassle since i'd have to waste a move retreating my N. i'm keen to castle kingside asap so i need to get my king side pieces active. my options are Nf3 Bd3 or Bc4. i'm usually quite aggressive so i'll play 5. Bc4 which can be followed up with the threat of 6. Qf3 7. Qxf7#. there is no d pawn to threaten my B on c4 and if you play 5... b5 i can retreat with 6. Bb3 and still have the pressure on f7 always a weak square for black

However this morning I am faced with Bc4 which Mat at least mentioned in his comment. This I reckon is another point against early plans. How can you possibly predict what your opponent will consider to be the next best move? Anyway I think sticking with 5. nf6 is still an okay move. It connects my knights which might be useful. It doesn't immediately help with the f7 weakness but I still think I can deal with that by 6. e6 if he decides to go down that route. 6. e6 also opens a line for my dark bishop and prepares the way for king side castling which I would like to do asap given the way this game seems to be heading. I don't think there is any value in trying to chase the bishop away just yet. It would only waste time which I should be spending on development. Looking around the board I can't see any other moves I like better so I'm going to stick with 5. Ngf6"
591,37,10,f3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/2BPN3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Nf6 presents an immediate threat on my unguarded N at e4 so i have to deal with it. retreating it seems a waste of development opportunity and goes against the classic don't move the same piece twice in the opening. i think either f3 or Qe2 is viable. normally i hate defending a minor piece with the queen so i might defend with f3. an exchange of N's 6... Nxe4 7. fxe4 is in my favor i think since it gives strong pawns in the center and after a king side castle an open f rank for the rook can be quite powerful.
592,37,11,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/2BPn3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I take your point about the attacking possibilities for the rook along the f file but I also think that the open f file creates a weakness in the kings defences. Always assuming that you go for king side castling. It is true that your position in the centre would look solid and my lack of development worries me. Having said that though I think it has to be done so my choice is 6.Nxe4.
593,37,12,fxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/2BPP3/8/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',pretty much forced to get back the material nothing else gains more in the immedidate move. the pressure is now on to get the knight out for the king side castle. i think 8.Nf3 is a better choice than 8.Ne2 since it keeps the N close. 8.Qf3 is also a possibility threatening 9.Qxf7# but it seems any black development move next will stop it. no matter what i need to be careful since all my pieces on the 4th rank are effectively hanging at the moment. i expect something like 7..e6 from black next to open up the bishop and queen and help f7
594,37,13,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/4p3/2BPP3/8/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq e6',Well white is expecting 7.e6 which is a move i had been wanting to play and spoke about before. I think in the current position 7.e5 would be better. It still opens the diagonal that I wanted for my bishop and a possibility of the queen giving check on h4 and white would then have to further weaken the king side defences to counter it. In my view the threat to f7 is no longer immediate now that the knight is out of the way. It really has to be either e5 or e6 but which one? Okay e5 it will be. I'm not going too make any predictions yet about the next few moves as I feel that there are just too many possibilities here.
595,37,14,Qf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/4p3/2BPP3/5Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',"already i'm reconsidering whether taking with the f pawn and leaving my f file open was a good idea...

i need to defend the d pawn and can do so in a number of ways. ( it's already protected by the queen but i always find allocating the queen to pawn protection at any time of the game is a bad idea. the only time this seems ok is if the exchange in this case exd4 Qxd4 is guaranteed soon and would put the queen in a good position and i think neither is the case here) c3 Be3 Ne2 or Nf3 would all develop a piece with an extra defender on d4 but i'm going for something a bit more agressive defence by threat Qf3.
  
if the threat is ignored
8... exd4 9. Qxf7#

if the mate is directly blocked
8... Nf6 9. dxe5 wins the knight (i think)  

8... f6 9. dxe5 fxe5 10. Qf7#
8... f6 9. dxe5 Nxe5 (more likely) 10. Qh5+ will cause a ruckus.

lots of interesting lines coming out of this one including the ones i missed that will no doubt win the queen for black ;P"

I enjoyed the break but was horrified to get back to this game and see the enormous threat to my f7 square. Of course this must be dealt with before I can think about too much else. I think my two most realistic options are 8. f6 or 8. Nf6. I read White's comment about Nf6 losing the knight but I think I may be able to get around this with a counter threat to his queen. (assuming 9. d x e5 Bg4 or even 9.Qe7). Also f6 would mean moving one of my king defending pawns (assuming I get a chance to castle king side at some point) and I prefer not to move the pawn just yet. After another look around to make sure I'm not missing anything else I have come down in favour of 9. Nf6 as I'm now getting more confident that I can hang on to said knight.
597,37,16,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/2BPP3/5Q2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',"i didn't pick the counter threat of Bg4 and it's more than just a threat on the queen! for a moment i was thinking it could be avoided by playing 9. dxe5 Bg4 10. Qf4 but the threat changes from against the queen to against the king after 10... Qd1+. i also need to consider the additional pressure the black queen puts on d4 now the N has moved. i'm not sure how to keep d4? 9. c3 exd4 10. cxd4 Qxd4 doesn't look nice for white. 9. Bg5 a pin on the queen looks interesting as by NOT taking with the d pawn i don't allow the open d file as well as exposing my R as a defender for d1.

if 9. Bg5 exd4 10. e5 threatens the N again.
if 9. Bg5 Bg4 10. Qf2 exd4 11. e5 and we're back to the threatened N. 
if 9. Bg5 h6. 10. Bh4 g5 11. Bg3 the pin is gone but the king side pawns are all over the place.
if 9. Bg5 Be7 i think that 10. Bxf7 would be very interesting! since 10... Kxf7 pins the N to king

I had a long look at 9.exd4 however I have a feeling black might castle long and this would leave the d4 pawn needing to find protection from somewhere. I have decided that to me at least 9. Qxd4 looks the stronger move. After that I'm fairly sure that white will play 10. Bxf6 to which I would reply Q xc4 which leaves me just one pawn down. If this scenario is followed then I have just one unprotected pawn on e5 and I don't see how to defend it just yet. Also I'm pleased to still have a bishop pair even though they are not in the game too much just yet. They also both currently have nice open diagonals to work along. If once again my little scenario is followed if I were white I would then choose 0-0-0 and this is the move that worries me a lot because it would then give the white rook control of the now open d file.

Black attempts to misplace my pieces with this check.  I can either play Nc3 and transpose to the Nimzo-Indian or play Bd2 when the normal move is Be7.

I assume that Black was scared of my d3 bishop but that is no way to approach chess.  Prophylaxis is good but this way too much.  I always strive to play active moves and reach for the initiative rather than react to my opponents moves.

The center is always the most important area of the board whether you control it with your pawns (classical) or your pieces (hyper-modern) is your decision.

In Nimzowitsch's My System he claims that whoever can control the 7th rank should always win.  (Yea yea there is more to it than that but that is MY simple analysis of it).

671,39,21,2f6,b'r1bq1rk1/7p/p2nppp1/1p6/3PP3/2RB1N2/1PQ2PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Another weakness.  My coach used to say that every pawn move is like giving away a hundred dollar bill.  It is fine giving a hundred dollar bill if you are buying something very valuable.  But if you are just throwing them away that is no good at all (unless you are Bill Gates I guess) !  So be careful when you make pawns moves.  They can be very good but they always create a weakness.  Pawns can never return or guard the space left behind.  The key is to strive to take the space left behind.
672,39,22,2e5,b'r1bq1rk1/7p/p2nppp1/1p2P3/3P4/2RB1N2/1PQ2PPP/2R3K1 b - -',"I think this may actually win by force though I haven't checked all the lines.  Do you see what f6 left behind?
