However this is when black timed out as I said earlier right when it was getting interesting. 39 days for 14 1/2 moves - this game could have gone on for months...

Another duel with Freddy and yet another loss but this game lasted one move longer than all my white games against him.  With the black pieces my form against him has previously been shot - i.e. 4 out of 5 of those checkmates he has put on me has been when I have been playing black against him.  Anyhow - let's see how the drama unfolds.  Freddy kicks off with his favourite Dunst Opening Nc3.
19,2,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',1. ........ d5 - tried d5 rather than c5 the last time I played against it against Freddy - that game terminated in 23 moves!

21,2,3,Qc7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppq1pppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',7. ......... Qc7 - the most popular move in the gameknot db but maybe I ought to have developed a piece or at least played e6 to free up Fou Lenoir and prepare for castling.

Qxe5 - I realise that I will drop Fou Leblanc after the rook trade on d7 but I felt that I had virtually been playing without him for the whole game and would pick up a couple of pawns as compensation for the piece and activate Glenda.  As you will see however the Witch has a target on b7 and boy she does not miss it!

41,2,23,4Qb6,b'8/1p3pkp/pQp1p1p1/P1P5/1q5P/8/5PP1/5BK1 b - -',47. Qb6!! - this move kills the game stone dead for me.  Exchanging queens here is no good because of 48. cxb6 followed by 49. Bxa6.  This counter sac would get me into a losing K & P ending because Henry is too far away to stop the b pawn crowning.  As a futile gesture Glenda grabs the pawn on h4 which prolongs the game for one more move to make it my longest game.  I resigned the game on the next move because I could not save my b pawn and then the witch would clean up one or both of the remaining pawns and crown one or both of the remaining white queenside pawns.  I lost the game here by failing to expand on the queenside.  This resulted in Fou Leblanc being tied up and getting in the way of my pieces.  I think I kept the queenside closed because I remembered my last game as black with Freddy where he attacked down both sides of the board which resulted in me getting my 5th checkmate from him.  I did not want that to happen again.  I must find a more positive way of preventing this calamity.  More improvement is needed.  Can I improve further on this against Freddy? Watch this space.

47,3,4,1Nhf3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3bn2/3p4/2PP4/1P3N1P/PBQN1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',So the knight's back where it started. At least the bishop's no longer on f5 attacking that diagonal.
48,3,5,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p3bn1p/3pN3/2PP4/1P5P/PBQN1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I like putting the knight up there. It's hard to chase it away but I don't know what it'll do yet.

I don't know except that the position felt too balanced and I wanted to get it unbalanced somehow. This probably isn't the best way but I also liked having access to c4 and e4.

56,3,13,2Ned6,b'4rrk1/1p2bpp1/p1pN2np/3b4/2NP1q2/PP4QP/1B3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Enough dancing -- it's time for a massive trigger. We both know it's coming and we're just trying to get our pieces in a spot so they'll be better placed after the trade.
57,3,14,Bxb3,b'5rk1/1p3pp1/p1pN2np/8/3P4/Pb4PP/1B4P1/4R1K1 w - -',And he accepted a draw here. Actually he must've offered it since he just moved. I remember being real surprised because I thought I was in more trouble. Sure I get back the pawn on b7 but I wasn't thrilled about Bb8. After his bishop moves what can I do with my bishop. It seems like it'll be forever blocked by the pawn on d4 and easy for his rook to harass. Maybe it's because the draw assured his team of winning the match; I needed to win for us to have a chance to catch and tie them.
58,4,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A friendly game with my boss. He's white and opens with the Larsen's Opening. Not a very popular choice for white being the 6th most common first move and only 1/3 as popular as the 5th most common move 1. g3 (Benko's Opening) which prepares white's kingside castle. I reply with 1. ... e5 the Modern Variation looking to establish the center and shut down white's bishop after the fianchetto at b2.
59,4,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',The obvious continuations.
60,4,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/8/1PN5/PBPPPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',3. Nc3 might not be white's strongest option. It blocks the fianchettoed bishop for little gain and it also blocks white's c-pawn which might be a valuable attacker should black play a pawn to d4. The main line suggests 3. e3 for white opening lines for the other bishop and preparing to play a pawn to d4.
61,4,3,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b6/1PNP4/PBP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Well I'm out of book moves. Just playing by ear. White offered me the classic knight pin so I take it relieving a little pressure from d5.
62,4,4,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/1b2P3/1PNP4/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq d6',Fighting for the center.

In retrospect that was probably the best line because then it seems white cannot save his knight on c3. Instead I play for the simpler approach winning the pinned knight with a pawn. 6. Nf3? needs a question mark for not defending the position at c3. Oddly general opening principles say to develop pieces preferably knights before bishops and white followed that principle - this was just one of those cases where there was danger on the board that needed to be handled before following general opening principles.
64,4,6,Qd6,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/4p3/4P3/1PQP1N2/P1P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Defends the pawn at e5.

It's worth noting that the moves up to this point had been spread out over several days but both players were online together and played the game to its conclusion from this point forward. Both players were playing fairly rapidly like one might do in a friendly OTB game so there's a little bit of slop ahead.

That would leave black up by a knight for two pawns not necessarily a winning advantage. I give 21. ... Nh5? a question mark. I realized this after I submitted the move and sweatted it out for about two minutes while I waited for my opponent to submit his move.
72,4,14,Nf4,b'5rk1/1pp2ppp/2n1b3/4p1P1/r1P1Pn2/P2P1N1P/1K2BP2/3R3R w - -',White missed it so I hurry and get off of h5 with a fork against the white bishop and the pawn at h3.
73,4,15,exd4,b'5rk1/1pp2ppp/2n1b3/6P1/r1PpPn2/P4N1P/1K2BP2/3R3R w - -',White tried to get tricky threatening 24. d5 with a pawn fork against black's bishop at e3 and knight at c3. However white's bishop is still en prise and black can exchange in the center making sure that white's knight is not on d4 when black plays Nxe2 thus gaining a piece.

Black was up by one piece not enough material to guarantee a win but enough to probably win. After 24. c5?? black is up two pieces and now has an easy win especially with a passed pawn an with white's broken queenside pawn structure and exposed king.

If he does my king will head be able to over to the h-file to block them and take the pawns and then attack his pawns from behind. If his king goes over to the queenside I play b4 so he has to go all the way down to a3 go take the pawns that block his while I take the pawn on f5 and easily queen that pawn. Or if puts his king on g6 to keep me from taking those pawns my king blocks him from coming any further plus I'll trade my a and b pawns for his a and c pawns and his king will be too far away to stop the c-pawn from queening.
101,5,18,Kf6,b'8/8/p1p2k1p/2P2p1P/1P6/P3P3/5K2/8 w - -',Same thing. If he plays Kxh5 he'll be too far away to be able to stop my c-pawn.

The creative part of me considers it shockingly bad form to decline such a brilliant sacrifice which the other player has put so much thought into. This made me really annoyed.

291,11,18,4Kh6,b'8/5k2/2p1p2K/pp3bP1/3P1R2/P1P5/5P2/8 b - -',Back on the dark squares.
292,11,19,4Rxf5,b'6k1/8/2p1p2K/pp3RP1/3P4/P1P5/5P2/8 b - -',I think this works. White's pawn can pull through without the added complications of the rook and bishop. An example of Simplifying in a winning position.
293,11,20,b4,b'6k1/6P1/2p4K/p4p2/1p1P1P2/P1P5/8/8 w - -',I just need to be careful NOT to take all the pawns on offer otherwise Black will be stalemated! With care White still has a clear win.

Not sure where it will lead other than possibly a lot of exchanges hoping to exploit my  pawn endgame. Unfortunately this is where my opponent timed out. A victory for me but not the way I like. Fortunately this happened before the tournament reached 90% complete. Had we still been playing when 90% of all games were complete this game would be counted as a draw and I would not have advanced to the next round. Now my score is tied for first place in our group with both me and homyak at 5-1 (we split our games against each other and we each scored 2-0 against the other two opponents in the group).

386,17,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Team Match I'm playing black and I opt for the Sicilian. This is now my second longest game on GameKnot. Along the way it feels as if black just claims little advantage after little advantage piling them on until the pile is overwhelming but white doesn't let black get any easy checkmates until he runs out of defenders.
387,17,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White played the uncommon Bowlder Attack (2. Bc4). Standard for black is 2. ... e6 but black defers that for a developing move with a shot at the e4 pawn.
388,17,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Back to the main line.
389,17,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2BpP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black's strongest option according to what little I find about the Bowlder Attack is to get an early pawn on d5 to attack the white bishop with tempo. But I found that now when annotating not during the game. So maybe black's 4th move isn't the best line bringing out white's queen and making d5 a difficult square for black to occupy. First advantage in the pile.
390,17,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Developing with an attack gaining a bit of tempo.

Probably ought to put a ? on 7. Nge2?. And before a commenter might point out that it's unnecessary to indicate the ""g"" in that move I'm only parroting what the GameKnot notation recorded. 7. Ne2? would be sufficient but the automatic notation wizard inserted the unnecessary ""g"" so I did to for consistency."

Now white has doubled isolated pawns on the half-open c-file ripe for the picking and his isolated a-pawn is only slightly less attainable. Second addition to the pile.

397,17,11,Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b1n2N/2q5/P1P5/1BP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I'm not comfortable with the potential for white's queen knight and fianchettoed bishop to put pressure on the black's kingside with all the black pieces on the queenside. This move locks white's queen off of f3 and g4. Also black is planning to fianchetto the LSB on b7 to aim at white's castle so moving the slow knight to the kingside first puts it in range to quickly support an attack on white's king.

399,17,13,d6,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/3pp3/1pb1n2N/7q/P1P4P/1BP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',The black pawn on b5 is en prise from white's queen but white's queen is defending the knight on h5 so she can't capture the pawn just yet.
400,17,14,Qxc4,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/3pp3/1pb1n2N/2q5/P6P/1BP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',That's probably another ? for white with 17. c4? moving the pawn to c4 where three black pieces can safely capture it. Then again doubled and isolated on a half-open file that pawn was doomed anyway. Black captures in such a way as to invite a queen exchange while threatening the c2 pawn which limits white's replies. The black knight still locks the white queen off of f3 and g4. More on the pile.
401,17,15,Qh4,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/3pp3/1pb1n2N/7q/P6P/1BPQ1PP1/R4RK1 w - -',White didn't want to exchange queens and who could blame him? Now he's eyeballing g5 again. Black needs to prevent that.

425,18,2,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq c6',All right if the queen's gambit is good for white maybe it's good for black.
426,18,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3p1B2/2N5/PPPQPPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',I am at a loss for finding this opening anywhere. I'm down to Queen's Pawn Game or Closed Game being my best options. So from here I'm just winging it. White bumped his queen up to d2 let's make her move twice and commit herself to the center where I can pick on her a little.
427,18,4,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/Q4B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Since the LSB is going to d7 soon no need to worry about blocking him in just yet and I may have need of the DSB so I open him up and prepare to castle if I wish. However in light of the next few moves I may have been better off with Nd7.
428,18,5,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1N1pp3/Q4B2/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',I panicked a bit here. White has a strong attack and my queenside seems full of holes. White's knight threatens the fork on c7 supported by his bishop. But he also blocks his queen's pin on the black knight at c6. I wanted to play 6. e5 instead of 6. e6 but with the knight pinned e5 wasn't available. Now it is.
429,18,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1pn3/Q7/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Evidently white wants to kill the black rook something fierce.
430,18,7,Ke7,b'r1bq1b1r/ppN1kppp/5n2/3pn3/Q7/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',It's double-check nothing for it but to move the king and lose the rook. Well lose the exchange because I will get that knight.
431,18,8,Nc6,b'N1bq1b1r/pp2kppp/2n2n2/3p4/Q7/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Defending the pawn at a7. Moving the pawn with 10. ... a6? would be a mistake that would allow white's knight to escape.
432,18,9,Be6,b'N2q1b1r/pp2kppp/2n1bn2/3p4/Q7/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Defend the d5 pawn and prepare to kill that impertinent knight. White's choice to castle may have been a mistake. Instead 11. Qb5 looked fairly strong putting pressure on the pawn at b7 and making it very difficult for black to move his bishop off of c8. 11. ... b6 wouldn't help much - after 12. ... Be3 white could play 13. Nxb6 and gain two pawns for the loss of his knight ending up way ahead in material.
433,18,10,Qxa8,b'q4b1r/pp2kppp/2n1bn2/3p4/Q1P5/8/PP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',I pounce on that knight before white sees the opportunity I mentioned in my last note. Get it now while the getting is good. 
434,18,11,Nxd5,b'q4b1r/pp2kppp/2n1b3/3n4/Q7/8/PP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',After all that the material is about even and white has developed a queen and rook and castled into a broken castle on an open file. Black has developed two knights and a bishop (and has developed his king though maybe that's not yet a good thing).
435,18,12,Nf6,b'q4b1r/pp2kppp/2n1bn2/8/4Q3/8/PP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',White attacked the knight at d5 black brings it to safety.
436,18,13,Qc8,b'2q2b1r/pp2kppp/2n1bn2/8/8/3Q4/PP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Getting the queen out of the corner and threatening to win the white queen with 16. ... Nb4  17. Qc3 (or lose the queen) Nxa2  and wins the queen anyway.
437,18,14,Bxa2,b'2q2b1r/pp2kppp/2n2n2/8/8/2Q5/bP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',White averted the threat. All seems safe so let's gobble a pawn. 
438,18,15,Nb4+,b'2q2b1r/pp2kppp/5n2/8/1n6/Q7/bP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',White forked the black king and the bishop on a2 but black had a move all prepared to handle that.
439,18,16,Qxc3+,b'5b1r/pp2kppp/5n2/8/1n6/2q5/bP2PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',White is still tragically underdeveloped. Eliminating the royal ladies leaves black way ahead in development and ahead in material and with a strong attack against the paralyzed white kingside.
440,18,17,Nbd5,b'5b1r/pp2kppp/5n2/3n4/8/2P5/b3PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Threaten the isolated pawn.
441,18,18,Ne4,b'5b1r/pp2kppp/8/3n4/4n3/2P5/bK2PPPP/3R1BNR w - -',Threaten it again. White loses the exchange if he plays 21. Kxa2 Nd4xf3. But the knight on e4 is not just threatening one pawn - he's threatening two.
442,18,19,Nxc3+,b'5b1r/pp2kppp/8/8/8/2nP4/K5PP/5BNR w - -',A little exchange sequence that wins a pawn for black. It also leaves an isolated white pawn on d3.
443,18,20,Nxf1,b'5b1r/pp2kppp/8/8/8/1K1P2PN/7P/5n1R w - -',Exchanging to exploit black's material lead.
444,18,21,f6,b'5b1r/pp2k1pp/5p2/8/8/1K1P2PN/7P/5R2 w - -',Hmmm now white is the more developed. That's a switch. Time to fix it. First keep the white knight out of my home.
445,18,22,Kf7,b'5b1r/pp3kpp/5p2/8/5N2/1K1P2P1/7P/5R2 w - -',Open the line for the bishop.
446,18,23,Re8,b'4r3/pp3kpp/3b1p2/3N4/3P4/1K4P1/7P/5R2 w - -',Rook on an open file planning to wreak havoc on the 7th.
447,18,24,Bb8,b'1b2r3/p4kpp/1p3p2/1N6/3P4/1K4P1/7P/5R2 w - -',The bishop and pawn were forked only one move saves them both.
448,18,25,Re3,b'1b6/5kpp/pp3p2/3P4/8/1KN1r1P1/7P/5R2 w - -',Pins the knight.
449,18,26,Rxf2,b'8/5kpp/pp3p2/3Pb3/2K5/6P1/5r1P/3N4 w - -',Removing white's strongest piece.
450,18,27,a5,b'8/5kpp/1p3p2/p2Pb3/2K5/6P1/5N1P/8 w - -',And now it's smooth sailing with a relatively easy two-pawn-up endgame. The black bishop controls the promotion square for black's a-pawn so that's the one I want to promote first.
451,18,28,Ke7,b'8/4k1pp/1p3p2/p2Pb3/2K1N3/6P1/7P/8 w - -',Limits the mobility of the white knight.
452,18,29,Kd7,b'8/3k2pp/1p3p2/pK1Pb3/4N3/6P1/7P/8 w - -',At this point I worked out two possible endings: 41. Kxb6 a4 42. Nc5  Kd6 43. Nxa4 Kxd5 44. Kb5 Ke4 45. Nc5  Kf3 46. Ne6 g5 47. Nf8 h6 48. Nd7 Kg2 49. Nxe5 fxe5 50. Kc4 Kxh2 51. Kd3 Kxg3 52. Ke4 h5 53. Kxe5 h4 54. Kf5 g4 55. Ke4 h3 56. Ke3 h2 57. Ke2 h1=Q and also 41. Kxb6 a4 42. Nd2 a3 43. Nb3 a2 44. Kc5 a1=Q 45. Nxa1 Bxa1 46. h3 Be5 47. g4 g6 48. h4 f5 49. gxf5 gxf5 50. Kc4 f4 51. Kd3 Kd6 52. Ke4 h5 53. Kf3 Kxd5 54. Kf2 Ke4 55. Ke2 f3  56. Kf2 Bd4  57. Kg3 f2 58. Kg2 Kd3 59. Kf1 Kd2 60. Kg2 Ke2. These two endings both win for black so I felt confident that all would be well.
453,18,30,a4,b'8/3k2pp/1K3p2/3Pb3/p3N3/6P1/7P/8 w - -',Now the pawn is ahead of the white king. Only the white knight can prevent promotion. White's next move is obvious.
454,18,31,Kxd5,b'8/6pp/1K3p2/3kb3/N7/6P1/7P/8 w - -',White just won two pawns for one closing the gap in material but the black king is in position to annihilate white's remaining pawns and there's not much white can do about it.
455,18,32,Bd4,b'8/6pp/1K3p2/2Nk4/3b4/6P1/7P/8 w - -',I have to give at least one ? to white's 44th move. 44. Nc5? was the worst thing white could do in this situation as black's reply demonstrates. Now white loses his knight and the game. Maybe two question marks.
456,18,33,Ke6,b'8/2K3pp/4kp2/2b5/8/6PP/8/8 w - -',Keep the white king away from the black pawns. If 47. Kd8 f5 48. Ke8 Be7 traps the white king. Black is free to play a 3-on-2 pawn endgame as long as he doesn't kill both white pawns and end in an immediate stalemate.
457,18,34,Bf2,b'8/6pp/2K1kp2/8/8/6PP/5b2/8 w - -',White tries a different way so black begins a little bishop dance to chase white's pawns into exchanges that favor black.
458,18,35,Be3,b'8/6pp/2K1kp2/8/6P1/4b2P/8/8 w - -',Dancing. Whit's g-pawn cannot advance now. Black can now play 49. f5 and exchange one pair of pawns isolating white's remaining pawn.
459,18,36,Bf2,b'8/6pp/2K1kp2/8/6PP/8/5b2/8 w - -',Dancing. 
460,18,37,Be3,b'8/6pp/2K1kp2/7P/6P1/4b3/8/8 w - -',Dancing more - that Bishop Can Dance! Now white cannot advance either pawn. Right where black wants them.
461,18,38,Kxf5,b'8/2K3pp/8/5k1P/8/4b3/8/8 w - -',White was forced to exchange. And now he'll be forced again.
462,18,39,hxg6,b'8/8/3K2p1/5k2/8/4b3/8/8 w - -',And now a simple endgame. White's king cannot possibly stop the pawn from promoting.
463,18,40,Kf4,b'8/8/8/8/5kp1/3Kb3/8/8 w - -',Save the bishop.
464,18,41,Kf3,b'8/8/8/8/8/4bkp1/8/5K2 w - -',It's easy when the bishop covers the square on which the pawn will promote. The opposing king cannot claim the promotion square and hold out for a draw.
465,18,42,Ke4,b'8/8/8/8/4k3/4b3/2K5/6q1 w - -',White's had enough. This has been my longest game on GameKnot so far. In fact it's 13 moves longer than my former longest. Well played by white.
466,19,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Italian opening. It is said (by somebody to me over the internet) that this opening favors black when black follows this move with Nf6 (the four horses defense [or something.])
467,19,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So this is what I do.
468,19,2,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I had no idea what to do here. I have an openings problem. I think I would have been better off if I followed my own instincts instead of going with the four horses (by which I mean 2 knights defense) which probably works better for players who have studied the game more than I have?
469,19,3,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Apparently should have gone exd4 here.

471,19,5,Nxe4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 w kq -',7... Nxe4?! is too risky; Black cannot hope to hold the extra pawn and opening the e-file with White castled and Black not is suicidal.
472,19,6,1Nxc6,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2Nb4/8/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 b kq -',He takes my bishop forcing me to double and isolate my pawns.
473,19,7,1bxc6,b'r3k2r/p1p2ppp/2pb4/8/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 w kq -',See?
474,19,8,1Re1,b'r3k2r/p1p2ppp/2pb4/8/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',And now my knight is gone.
475,19,9,1f5,b'r3k2r/p1p3pp/2pb4/5p2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq f6',Lame attempt to defend. Losing me a nice castle.
476,19,10,1f3,b'r3k2r/p1p3pp/2pb4/5p2/4n3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',Now she is gone for good.
477,19,11,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/p1p3pp/2pb4/5p2/4n3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',Maybe I should have done this earlier...eh? ... I could have castled when he first threatened the knight. Then he takes it and I go Bf4 now I have his bishop in exchange or a checkmate on the next move. Although that is blocked by going back to Re1...I dunno. Help! ... I guess if I hadn't put my bishop there earlier I could have castled and threatened checkmate if the rook took my knight.
478,19,12,Bc5+,b'2kr3r/p1p3pp/2p5/2b2p2/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',I think maybe I'd have had a better shot at the mate if I had just taken the damned pawn here. Then rook takes pawn back Bc5 and then potentially easy mate...unless white goes Kf1...which would be troubling.
479,19,13,1Nc3,b'2kr3r/p1p3pp/2p5/2b5/4p3/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1R2K b - -',Now when the bishop comes out the rook has two guards on the king's row making my job even more difficult.
480,19,14,Rd5,b'2k1r3/p1p3pp/2p5/2br2B1/4p3/2N5/PPP3PP/R3R2K w - -',This is what killed me. Mouse slip actually. I should have asked for a take back (which you can do on yahoo) but I felt like it was going so well already I might as well go down in flames instead of begging for mercy.
481,19,15,1Nxd5,b'2k1r3/p1p3pp/2p5/2bN2B1/4p3/8/PPP3PP/R3R2K b - -',Game's over now but I'll play it out anyway. Ah the many punishments we eternal optimists will endure.
482,19,16,1e3,b'2k1r3/p1p3pp/2p5/2bN2B1/8/4p3/PPP3PP/R3R2K w - -',I should have took the horsie.

I played it out but I can't bear to put the rest of the game down as it's really difficult copying yahoo's chess notation onto the board.
484,20,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is a bit of a redux of a game already annotated by blake84120. I wanted to check out a set of moves he recommended at the end. I couldn't figure it out (the advantage of it that is) from reading the annotation alone so I spelled it out for myself and here it is. Enjoy!
485,20,1,1Rhd1,b'r3r1k1/p2bn1pp/p4p2/4p3/PB2P3/5N2/4KPPP/R2R4 b - -',Blake suggested a potentially awesome turn of events here but that's not what I'm most interested in checking out: ... Blake: The pin on the knight isn't accomplishing much for black. The bishop was protecting the d7 square keeping white's rook from advancing. It might have been better for black to maintain that defense with 19. ... Be6 (he would have no fear of 20. Rd6 Kf2 21. Rxa6?? Bc4 ).
486,20,2,1Bg4,b'r3r1k1/p3n1pp/p4p2/4p3/PB2P1b1/5N2/4KPPP/R2R4 w - -',Unfortunately I didn't think of all that.

488,20,4,3Nd2,b'1r4k1/p5pp/p4p2/B3p3/P3b1P1/2R1K2P/1r1N1n2/8 b - -',The actual move made here was Bg2 but the obvious choice one one would think would be Nd1 for the fork followed by a rook snatch. Here is what blake suggested: ... Blake: One continuation I would have had to really consider here if I had been black would be 30. ... Nd1  31. Kxe4 Rb8b4  32. Bxb4 Rxb4  33. Kd3 Nxc3 34. Kxc3 Rxa4. While this loses a little material it manages to leave black in an endgame where he is up by the exchange and four pawns. Better it exchanges off everything but white's knight leaving black essentially with King Rook 5 pawns against King Knight 2 pawns an easy endgame to win. I don't know if I would have played it but I would have given it a serious look. ... Herc: So I couldn't follow this at all but I am about to check it out now.

503,22,3,e6,b'2kr1b1r/ppqn1p1p/2p1pp2/5b2/2PP4/4BN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is a common setup for Black. It seems like White should have the advantage but somehow when I play this good things seem to happen for me. And that can be what makes an opening or a defense a good one for you. I know that when I play my favorite White opening it's like opportunities just kind of magically appear sometimes.

768,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Annotating on behalf of my friend for instructional purposes. He's playing white and opens with the Open Game.
769,35,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Vienna Game.
770,35,2,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Black replied with the Falkbeer variation (aka Berlin Defense). White has four main lines here. 3. f4 (Vienna Gambit) 3. Bc4 (often transposes into lines form Bishop's Opening or King's Gambit) 3. g3 (to fianchetto the bishop) or Nf3 (usually transposes to Four Knight's Game). White chose none of the above and played the passive 3. d3. This move gains no real advantage blocking the king's bishop while opening the queen's bishop defending an adequately defended pawn at e4 and not really gaining any ground in the center.
771,35,3,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Np3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White jumped out violating a couple generic opening principles like not moving the same piece twice (important) not crossing the center line of the board while still developing (generally useful but not mandatory like with Ruy Lopez) and not attacking until you have several developed pieces to bring to bear (useful but not mandatory).
772,35,4,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Pp3/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White has doubled his pawns on the d-file. The farthest doubled pawn is usually the hardest to protect and often will be lost. Doubling pawns should be avoided if possible. The pawn on d5 does threaten black's knight but that isn't much compensation for the weakness a doubled pawn brings.
773,35,5,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/8/3Pp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Black retreated the knight as expected and now threatens the advanced doubled pawn. White breaks a couple more opening principles by moving a pawn that already moved and by not developing more pieces. He also leaves his d5 pawn hanging unprotected.
774,35,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3np3/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Black gobbled the free pawn and now white is attacking the undefended knight on d5. This move is a good one it develops a piece to a good central square and does so with a threat. Although it does violate one general opening principle: it's usually better to develop a knight before devolping the bishop next to that knight. However this may be a case where breaking this rule is OK.
775,35,7,Qg4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/3np3/2BP2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Rather than retreat black defended the knight. This might be a good time to capture that knight. That would leave black with doubled pawns on the d-file. Then after white plays dxe5 those doubled pawns will have no support of adjacent pawns (they will be isolated without pawn support) and further they would be on a half-open file vulnerable to white's rooks. But it's not wise to exchange when behind in material. Still doubling and isolating those pawns is an almost certain guarantee that white can capture one and maybe both sometime soon regaining his lost material. Instead white takes a gamble bringing out the queen early and without making any overt threats.
776,35,8,Qh5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp4/3np2Q/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Black's move strengthened his center defending the pawn at e5 and discovering an attack against the white queen by the black bishop at c8. White is forced to move his queen again (violating the principle to not move the same piece twice - this violation is forced white cannot lose the queen but it calls into question the wisdom of the original 8. Qg4 move that allowed black to force this violation). White chooses h5 for this queen. Not a strong location. The queen is the most mobile piece on the board but from the edge her mobility is seriously decreased. She wants to live in the center. From h5 she has 7 moves that will get her killed 3 captures (pawns) that will all get her killed and only 3 safe moves to f3 e2 or back home to d1 none of which threaten black in any way. Which means the white queen is highly ineffective at h5 - though she does put pressure on e5 combined with the white pawn on d4 black will need to do something to avoid losing that e5 pawn.
777,35,9,1Qe2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2pp2p1/3np3/2BP4/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Black chases the white queen back to her own camp where she belongs. White's three last moves could have been summed up with 8. Qe2 leaving him free to make other developing moves on his 9th and 10th move.
778,35,10,1dxe5,b'r2qkb1r/pp3p1p/2ppb1p1/3nP3/2B5/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',I have to admit I'm a little surprised that the d4/e5 standoff remained on the board for so many moves when at times either side could have made a capture and gained a pawn there. I think black would have been better served taking advantage of his 9th move 9. ... g6 by playing 10. ... Bg7 developing a piece and defending his pawn at e5. Or he simply could have played 10. ... exd4 and solved the whole problem gaining a pawn but doubling his pawns on the d-file and likely losing that d4 pawn in the future.
779,35,11,1Bxg5,b'r3kb1r/pp3p1p/2ppb1p1/3nP1B1/2B5/8/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Wow. 11. ... Qg5?? deserves the double question mark. Black sends his queen into the slaughter probably thinking he was forking two pawns e5 and g2 but obviously overlooking white's bishop on c1.
780,35,12,1Bg3,b'r3kb1r/pp3p2/2ppb2p/3nP1p1/2B5/6B1/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Black has succeeded in driving the white bishop to right where it wants to be on the strong diagonal defending e5 and threatening bad things to come if black allows white to play exd6. Now it is time for white to start thinking about exchanging pieces off the board. He has a huge material advantage that needs to be exploited.
781,35,13,1O-O-O,b'r4b1r/pp1k1p2/2ppb2p/3nP1p1/2B5/6B1/PPP1QPPP/2KR2NR b - -',Black saw the threat and prevented the loss of his d6 pawn. White castles and brings his rook to bear on a half-open file aimed right at the pressure point in the center.
782,35,14,1Bxd5,b'r6r/pp1k1pb1/2ppb2p/3BP1p1/8/6B1/PPP1QPPP/2KR2NR b - -',Black's fianchetto adds more pressure to the center and white follows through with the idea of liquidating pieces to leverage his material advantage. However he missed the fact that he could play 16. exd6 and gain a pawn since the black bishop no longer defends the pawn at d6.
783,35,15,1exd6,b'r6r/pp1k1pb1/2pP3p/3b2p1/8/6B1/PPP1QPPP/2KR2NR b - -',Now white plays 17. exd6 but it is a move too late. First he needed to see to the safey of his pawn on g2 and consequently his rook on h1. I originally gave white's 17th move a ? since it seems to lose the exchange but then after further analysis (see my note to move 18) I retracted the ?.
784,35,16,1Qg4+,b'r6r/pp1k1pb1/2pP3p/6p1/6Q1/6B1/PPP2PbP/2KR2NR b - -',This begins a neat little combo that has the potential to save white's rook on h1. 18. ... Kd8 19. Be5 threatens black's bishop on g7. If black plays 19. ... Bxf5 white replies 20. Qxg2. If black plays 19. Bxh1 white plays 20. Bxg7 and now black saves his rook (20. ... Rg8 21. Bf6 ) giving white time to play f3 to trap the black bishop on h1 then Ne2 and Rxh1 gaining two bishops for a rook and pawn - roughly even trade.
785,35,17,1Ne2,b'r2k3r/pp3pb1/2pP3p/6p1/6Q1/6B1/PPP1NPbP/2KR3R b - -',But white missed the combination in my previous note and settled for losing the exchange. Not a big loss considering his material advantage.
786,35,18,2Rd1,b'r3k2r/pp3pb1/2pP3p/6p1/6Q1/6B1/PPP1NP1P/2KR4 b - -',Good move by white retaking the open file behind his advanced past pawn.
787,35,19,2Nd4,b'3r3r/pp1Pkpb1/2p4p/6p1/3N2Q1/6B1/PPP2P1P/2KR4 b - -',White missed Bc7 threatening chasing the rook off of the promotion square. From here he sets up a nice little fork on f5 forking the black king and the bishop on g7. Note that the white knight now obstructs the rook's defense of the pawn.
788,35,20,2Nf5+,b'7r/pp1rkpb1/2p4p/5Np1/6Q1/6B1/PPP2P1P/2KR4 b - -',Now black is in trouble again. The knight forks the king and the bishop. The king has to move but he is the only defender of his rook - if he moves to defend the bishop the rook will fall and if he remains near the rook the bishop will fall. Black's king cannot save them both.
789,35,21,2Rxd7,b'7r/pp1R1pb1/2p2k1p/5Np1/6Q1/6B1/PPP2P1P/2K5 b - -',Black chooses to lose the rook a questionable choice. White pounces while he can.
790,35,22,2Nxg7,b'1r6/pp1R1pN1/2p2k1p/6p1/6Q1/6B1/PPP2P1P/2K5 b - -',Black defended a pawn not a bad choice since he cannot afford to lose any more material. White does the smart thing well a smart thing and exchanges pieces ridding black of one of his last two defenders - the other defender is off on the queenside babysitting pawns so black's king is exposed and defenseless now. It's worth noting that black's move 25. ... Rb8?? puts his rook directly en prise from white's bishop on g3. White would have been just fine playing 26. Bxb8. There is a quick checkmate here too: 26. Be5  Kxe5 27. Nxg7 any 28. Qf5# or 26. ... Ke6 27. Nxg7  Kxe5 28. Qf5# or 26. ... Kg6 27. Nxg7 Kh7 28. Qf5  Kg8 29. Qxf7  K-moves 30. Ne8#
791,35,23,2Qf5,b'1r6/pp1R1pk1/2p4p/5Qp1/8/6B1/PPP2P1P/2K5 b - -',Now white should get rid of that rook on b8 but evidently he missed the long range attack. Not to worry much queen   rook   bishop against black's lone king while his rook is too far away is still a winning attack although that rook might foil some back-rank checkmates. The move as played threatens the pinned pawn on f7. Black has to lose it or defend it with his rook - which may be an argument for 27. Bxb8 and 28. Qf5 as a stronger attack. Truth is black is cornered and cannot escape white's mating web.
792,35,24,2Be5+,b'5r2/pp1R1pk1/2p4p/4BQp1/8/8/PPP2P1P/2K5 b - -',The perfectly logical continuation. Black is cornered and doomed and 27. Rf8 saved the quick checkmate but also sealed black's only escape route.
793,35,25,2Qf6,b'5rk1/pp1R1p2/2p2Q1p/4B1p1/8/8/PPP2P1P/2K5 b - -',And now there is no escape.

798,36,3,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Giving up the centre is not recommended but playable
799,36,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I thought he may play g6 here (or a move or two earlier) to transpose into a modern defence.
800,36,5,Qe7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Be7 is better

807,36,12,Qg3+,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2pp1/3p4/3PP2p/3N4/6qP/PPP1B3/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Again we played much better to force the win of the h pawn with this check rather than take the h pawn immediately
808,36,13,dxe5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2pp1/8/3Pp2p/3N4/7q/PPP1BK2/R1BQR3 w - -',I was slightly worried here. My king is exposed and he seems to have 4 connected passed pawns for two pieces. I could even be losing if I gave him time to mobilise them
809,36,14,2Nxa7+,b'2kr3r/Nppqbpp1/8/3Pp2p/8/8/PPP1BK2/R1BQ3R b - -',One pawn back!

860,37,45,2Kd7,b'3r3r/3kbp2/3pb1qp/Q1p1P1pN/PpPp4/3P4/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',He finds what he must think of as an escape route and truthfully I should have let him go down the rabbit hole but I was too smart for my own good.
861,37,46,2Qb5+,b'3r3r/3kbp2/3pb1qp/1Qp1P1pN/PpPp4/3P4/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I force him back to me and he can't escape to the back rank. This ultimately allows him to bring over his rook and protect him with h8 rook. Which causes me a ton of headaches later.
862,37,47,2Kc7,b'3r3r/2k1bp2/3pb1qp/1Qp1P1pN/PpPp4/3P4/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',His only move that is productive for him. had he gone to c8 it would have been a lot better for me but sadly he is too smart for that.

But again he is smart enough to be content with just trapping my queen there and attacking my king with his very free queen. Oh to be able to do things over again.
866,37,51,2Qxh5,b'1r5r/2k1bp2/Q2pb2p/P1p1P1pq/1pPp4/3P4/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Im a little shocked that he didn't attack my queen with his rooks at this point. Then I notice his plan is to keep my queen hostage and I realize that I've been snookered!
