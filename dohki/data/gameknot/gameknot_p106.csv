57,3,4,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',I think this is the more commons pawn break and indicates that black probably wants to attack on the king side 
58,3,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I think d5 used to be the go however these days castles is considered more accurate with the idea that black must first make some sort of concession before white clarity's the situation in the centre for example if Re8 now then white plays d5 and the rook is misplaced since the closing of the centre means the rook really belongs on f8. In short castling is the more flexible option and strong players love to play flexibly  
59,3,6,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now white closes the centre whilst hitting the knight. And now that the centre has been closed up play will now take place on the wings. White will attack on the queen side whereas black will attack on the kingside which is where he has the most space 
60,3,7,Ne1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b - -',White will put most of his energy into getting in the c5 break and this move plans to bring the knight to d3 where he can assist in facilitating that pawn break also from d3 the knight can in some cases come back to f2 to slow down blacks pawn storm. Another option is to play Nd2 and look to get in c5 followed by exchanging on d3 and then brining the knight to c4 to grind at d6 
61,3,8,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 w - -',Blacks pawn break is f5 so the knight gets out of the way so that the f pawn can advance

When both sides are attacking on opposite wings it becomes essential that both party's go after there goals with as much speed and energy as possible since reacting to the opponents threats will mean the defending side will quickly go down hill

This was done so that it would be harder for black to get in ...g4 however I should have jumped on the chance to exchange on b7 where after black recaptures he must waste time brining his bishop back into play on the kingside and in the meantime white would look to bring a knight to the c6 square and possibly a rook to the c file and I think white has more than enough play on the queenside to distract black from his play on the kingside 
73,3,20,1Rb8,b'1rbq1bk1/ppp3r1/2Pp1nn1/1P1Pp1pp/P3Pp2/B1N2P1P/4BNP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?! Black still should have played ...b6 this just wastes times as the rook will belong on the a file

75,3,22,2b6,b'1rbq1bk1/p1p3r1/1pPp1nn1/1P1Pp1pp/P3Pp2/B4P1P/N3BNP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black finally wakes up and snuffs out most of whites queenside play. Now although white will probably have good chances in an endgame black now has a free hand on the kingside to attack since whites queenside play isn't dangerous enough to distract black from matters on the kingside
76,3,23,2a5,b'1rbq1bk1/p1p3r1/1pPp1nn1/PP1Pp1pp/4Pp2/B4P1P/N3BNP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I need to open files on the queenside and this is the only way to do it

This will need to be played at some point if white plans to have any chances however I should have allowed my rook to see along the a file first. Now black wins the a file shutting out any chances white had since most of the game will now be played on the kingside where black is obviously much better. White has to reach an endgame now if there is any hope a queen exchange will be very helpful to white
78,3,25,Ra8,b'r1bq1bk1/2p3r1/1pPp1n2/1P1Pp1pp/4Pp1n/B1N2P1P/4BNP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Eugh without a queenside rook whites extra queenside space will be meaningless. The game is over on the queenside and now black can concentrate everything he has on the kingside though on the flip side white can also devote everything he has to the defence of the kingside 
79,3,26,2Kh2,b'r1bq1bk1/2p3r1/1pPp1n2/1P1Pp1pp/4Pp1n/B1N2P1P/4BNPK/R2Q1R2 b - -',I wasn't sure how to really improve my position and thought I might try and let my f1 rook defend better by moving to g1 or perhaps even coming to h1 in order to let my king escape to the centre/queenside. It may have been best however to have allowed the exchange of queenside rooks so that I only have one wing to worry about. But it's hard to make such a move when it simply admits that something has gone seriously wrong with whites plan
80,3,27,2g4,b'r1bq1bk1/2p3r1/1pPp1n2/1P1Pp2p/4Pppn/B1N2P1P/4BNPK/R2Q1R2 w - -',At last

It never occurred to me or my opponent either during the game or in the post game analysis session we had that capturing away from the centre would be incorrect however it turns out there are tactics based on ...Nxf3!

But at the same time I was concerned about being killed on the h file incidentally it never occurred to me that my rook could come to f1 in the event of danger along the h file since once the queen moves the f2 square would act as an escape route for my king. So possibly I should have used this time to do something with my queenside pieces by either allowing the trade of rooks or reorganising the pieces with Ra2Nb1 ect allowing my other rook to act as a defender. The main problem for white is that with no active play in any sector of the board black has all the time in the world organise his pieces for a breakthrough on the kingside 
85,3,32,3Rf3,b'r1b2bk1/2p3r1/1pPp2n1/1P1Pp3/4Pp1q/B1N2R2/4B1P1/R2Q2K1 b - -',This was actually as a result of the touch move rule for whatever reason I didn't notice that the bishop was covering h3 and I grabbed my rook ready to play Rh3 but suddenly realised that it couldn't be played so I had to move the rook

Luckily for me my opponent had about 9 seconds left at this point and panicked taking with the first piece that came to hand but this exchanges into a clearly lost endgames it was essential for black to keep queens on. Correct was 40...Bxd1 41.Rxg7+ Bxg7 and by keeping the queens on the ending is almost certainly winning for black. Though still quite interesting 
89,3,36,Bxg7,b'6k1/2p3b1/1pPp4/1P1Pp3/4P3/R7/8/3b1K2 w - -',Now because of the weakness on c7 white wins easily
90,3,37,4c7,b'6k1/2P5/1R1p3b/3Pp3/b3P3/8/5K2/8 b - -',I've improved a lot since I played in this tournament last year and my rating was only 1000 or so as well. I might annotate a couple of other games from this tournament as well so look out for more. Hope you enjoyed this instructive though albeit lucky encounter between me and a strong opponent and although there were probably a couple of things both sides missed it was an over the board encounter and accurate calculation in complex positions can be quite difficult especially with the time factor as well
91,4,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Hey all! This is the second game from this terrific league match. This time I hold the White pieces and very quickly offer an ill-conceived sacrifice. I try to cover my tracks by throwing more material at the problem in a desperate bid to expose the Black King before I run out of forces. Enjoy!
92,4,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Very standard Anglo-Indian.
93,4,2,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Now we're veering toward a standard King's Indian with 3...Bg7 4.d4 d6.
94,4,3,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/4P3/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',!? White avoids the classic King's Indian lines with this aggressive option. Black must accept the thorny pawn for now but the question remains whether White can hold onto it so far afield.
95,4,4,e6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/4P3/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',More common are 5...c6 or 5...d6. The text makes f6 a dangerous hole just to allow ...Ne7; it's probably better to develop the Knight to f5 via h6 instead.
96,4,5,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/4P1B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Taking advantage of the weakened dark squares.
97,4,6,h4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3pp1p1/4P1B1/2PP3P/2N2N2/PP1Q1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ h3',?! This is where as White I decided to make a big unsound sacrifice but really the choice isn't made until next move. With correct play from here White should retain a solid excellent position though 9.O-O-O would have been smoother and much more comfortable. See my next note...
98,4,7,dxe5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1npbp/4p1p1/4p1B1/2PP3P/2N2N2/PP1Q1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',All right. Now there are two lines that I see that look good for White. The first is the simple one; 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.dxe5 and once White castles he should be in good shape though he'll still probably have a tough time holding the e-pawn. The other line is much sharper and rather unclear: 10.dxe5?!! Qxd2+ 11.Kxd2?! Nec6 (say) 12.Bf6 and White has far better development offset by his awkwardly-centralized King. White should be able to pick up the d-file soon because of Black's queenside lack of development and may be able to use his greater activity to transition into a strong endgame. While this isn't the way the game went I'd be very interested to see how that line would have played out!
99,4,8,1Nxe5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1npbp/4p1p1/4N1B1/2PP3P/2N5/PP1Q1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ -',? Honestly this is a mistake. The lines I gave above are simply better. The text loses a piece for a pawn in a wildly speculative attempt to break into the Black kingside.
100,4,9,hxg6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1n1b1/4ppp1/6B1/2PP3P/2N5/PP1Q1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',Taking the Bishop would have allowed White to open the h-file for his Rook.
101,4,10,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3b1/2n1ppp1/5n2/2PP3P/2NBB3/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Piling up on the d-pawn.
102,4,11,1g4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3b1/2n1ppp1/5n2/2PP2PP/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/R3K2R b KQ g3',?! The d-pawn is pretty much indefensible so White goes on the offensive instead forcing Black to take with the f-Knight rather than the c-Knight.
103,4,12,1O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3b1/2n1ppp1/8/2Pn2PP/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/2KR3R b - -',15.Bxg6 was a strong consideration but the Bishop seems likely to get trapped back there and might even give Black an excuse to free his own LSB (via a trade on f5). Instead White accepts the loss of a pawn to activate his other Rook and get his King to a somewhat safer spot.
104,4,13,1f5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3b1/2n1p1p1/5p2/2Pn2PP/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/2KR3R w - -',Locking one White Bishop out while allowing the other one in--I think I like 15...e5 better (although considering how much trouble this pawn caused me down the road...)
105,4,14,Kf7,b'r1bq1r2/ppp2kb1/2n1p1p1/5p1P/2Pn2P1/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/2KR3R w - -',16...Ne7 was definitely worth a look. The problem is that now after 17.hxg6+ Black really ought not to recapture with the King as the g-file can open any second and White has sacrificed material to get another Rook ready to occupy it.
106,4,15,Kxg6,b'r1bq1r2/ppp3b1/2n1p1k1/5p2/2Pn2P1/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/2KR3R w - -',? This has got to be a mistake though even here I don't see a forced conclusion or even a decisive combination for White.
107,4,16,2Rh7,b'r1bq1r2/ppp2kbR/2n5/5p2/2Pn4/2NBB3/PP1Q1P2/2K3R1 b - -',Forcing Black to pull some pieces back to defend. Notice how strong White looks despite being a full piece behind. As long as White can remain the aggressor he has a chance to regain equilibrium with his activity advantage.
108,4,17,2Be2,b'r1bq2r1/ppp2kbR/2n5/5p2/2Pn4/2N1B3/PP1QBP2/2K3R1 b - -',I thought for a long time on this move. White's problems are the pawns on c4 and f5 preventing this Bishop from getting into the action. His other thorn is the nasty Nd4 ready to leap into action with a killer fork on f3 if given the chance and bottling up White's pieces with its mere presence. I'm loathe to exchange while a full piece behind this move is the best option I found for White--if Black leaves the Bishop alone White can renew his attack with a check on h5. If Black takes it the Knight is gone and the Queen will move to a much more useful location on e2. Essentially this is throwing another piece at the problem to hope it goes away but at least it's a relatively weak piece compared to Black's strong Knight.
109,4,18,2Nxe2+,b'r1bq2r1/ppp2kbR/2n5/5p2/2P5/2N1B3/PP1QnP2/2K3R1 w - -',This is a natural move and exchanging while ahead is generally good and Black certainly wants to avoid giving this Bishop a line to his King but I think this gives up too much. 21...Be6 or simple 21...Kf8 were both worth a look in my opinion.
110,4,19,Ne5,b'r1bq2r1/ppp2kbR/8/4np2/2P5/2N1B3/PP2QP2/2K3R1 w - -',? This feels like a perfectly reasonable rational move but in fact this inaccuracy tosses the game or at least lets White recover with advantage. I think the correct play was 22...Ne7 instead (or perhaps the more daring 22...Nd4?!). The critical factor is White's Bishop prepared to jump to either g5 or c5 at a moment's notice so that after 23.Qh5+ Black's only response must be 23...Ke6 whereupon White can pick up at least the Bishop at his leisure. Other King moves all lose instantly to the powerful White Bishop: 23...Kf6 or 23...Ke7 are met with 24.Bg5+ skewering through to win at least the Queen and 23...Kf8 fares no better as 24.Bc5+ forces Black to give up his Queen to prevent mate.
111,4,20,Kf8,b'r1bq1kr1/ppp3bR/8/4np1Q/2P5/2N1B3/PP3P2/2K3R1 w - -',?? As I mentioned above this is deadly; correct was 23...Ke6. The rest is just an elegant mating net.
112,4,21,Qd6,b'r1b2kr1/ppp3bR/3q4/2B1np1Q/2P5/2N5/PP3P2/2K3R1 w - -',Forced (24...Qe7 is certainly no better). Black soldiers on for a few more turns but defeat is now inevitable.
113,4,22,2Nd5+,b'r1b4Q/pp2k1r1/3p4/3Nnp2/2P5/8/PP3P2/2K3R1 b - -',1-0. It's mate in three (28...Kd7 29.Rxg7+ Nf7 30.Rxf7+ Kc6 31.Rc7#); Black sees it and throws in the towel after a hard-fought battle. Many thanks to mandinko for a great game!Comments are much appreciated on the game and/or the analysis. Thanks for reading!
114,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

This is Round 4 against The Great One GM Cyrano.  At the moment he is 4th seeded on Gameknot with his rating north of 2600!  Well guys I lose this one but at least I make Afro do a little work for it albeit I did tend to have a recurrence of passivitis which I cannot afford when playing the elite.  So how did this game unravel.  Here is gameknot analysis as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17807983&fb=1&rnd=0.181263129796375"
115,5,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1. ...... e6 - oh la la!  I decided to kick off with the French Defense.  I played that against lighttotheright (Ken) many moons ago but got my butt whipped.  However I decided it was time to resurrect my favourite riposte as black.
116,5,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ..... Bb4 - the Winawar.  This can lead to some sharp play.
117,5,3,bxc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',6. bxc3 - Afro's pawn structure is busted but can he get compo here?
118,5,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',7. ..... 0-0. This is a book move but I must be very careful here indeed with the Wicked Witch of the West bearing down on Henry.  At least a knight can go to g6 should Afro play Bh6.
119,5,5,Ng6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p1n1/2ppP2Q/3P4/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',9. ...... Ng6 - this move blocks the line of Afro's lsb which is attacking h7 and so is the Witch.  This knight move therefore prevents Henry from copping Old Matey.
120,5,6,1Ng5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2n1p1n1/2ppP1NQ/3P4/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',11. Ng5 - Old Matey keeps his eye on Henry.  The only way to prevent this is to move my pawn to h6.
121,5,7,Nxd4,b'r1b2rk1/pp4p1/4p1Bp/3pP3/3n4/P7/2P2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',15. ..... Nxd4 - there has been a whirlwind of exchanges here including the queens.  It looks as though I might get a decent game against Afro dare I say it?
122,5,8,exf5,b'r1br2k1/pp4p1/7p/2BpPp2/8/P7/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',18. ...... exf5 - this piece exchange has weakened my d5 pawn.  It is true that Afro's queenside pawns are weak and isolated but that will not bother him.
123,5,9,a6,b'r2r2k1/1p4p1/p3b2p/3pPp2/3B4/P7/2PK1PPP/R6R w - -',20. ....... a6 - this move was my first innacuracy according to Gameknot Analysis but I wanted to play Rac8 at some point in order to put pressure on c2.
124,5,10,axb5,b'r2r2k1/3b2p1/7p/1p1pPp2/3B4/8/2PK1PPP/RR6 w - -',"23. ...... axb5 - Afro gets rid of his weakie a pawn and I now have two weakie pawns on the d column and the b column giving Fou Leblanc a lot of work to do.  Fou Leblanc therefore becomes a ""bad"" bishop tied to defending pawns on his own squares."
125,5,11,Rde8,b'r3r3/B2b1k2/6pp/1p1pPp2/7P/6P1/2PK1P2/RR6 w - -',26. ..... Re8 - attacking the white e5 passer.
126,5,12,h5,b'r3r3/3b1k2/6p1/1p1pPp1p/7P/4B1P1/2PK1P2/RR6 w - -',27. ...... h5 - not Rxe5?? Rxa8!

130,5,16,Rxa8,b'r7/5k2/4b1p1/1p1p1pKp/3B3P/2P3P1/5P2/1R6 w - -',34. ....... Rxa8 - rook trade.
131,5,17,3f4,b'3r4/5k2/4b1p1/1R1p1pKp/3B1P1P/2P3P1/8/8 b - f3',36. f4!! - this move prevents f4 sacrificing my f pawn so that I can get Fou Leblanc onto f5 protecting my vital g pawn.
132,5,18,3Rg8,b'6r1/5k2/4b1p1/1R1p1pKp/3B1P1P/2P3P1/8/8 w - -',36. .... Rg8?? This move was flagged as a blunder.  Gameknot Analysis suggested Rd7 shielding Henry from being checked on the second rank by the WR.  However I noted that after Rb8 his rook could come round to h2 and inflict some damage.  However after reading Gameknot Analysis search engine I would have had drawing chances even though I would have been two pawns down.  Fou Leblanc would have protected the h and f pawns and Henry may well have been able to stop the c passer and I would have had a rook that could move freely.  Ah well you live and learn.
133,5,19,Bc8,b'2b1k1r1/1R6/5Kp1/3p1p1p/3B1P1P/2P3P1/8/8 w - -',38. ...... Bc8 - this move does not cut the mustard as although it prevents a Rb8+ skewer it does not prevent a Re7+ followed by either mate or loss of Fou Leblanc for starters by the Windmill.  I chose the more painless option .......
134,5,20,4Bb6#,b'2bk2r1/4R3/1B3Kp1/3p1p1p/5P1P/2P3P1/8/8 b - -',40. Bb6 MATE!! - ........ by allowing sudden death.  I was well and truly done on the black squares.

I have a couple of options here - perhaps 17.d6 cxd6  18.Nd5 Qe8 19.cxd6.  Or perhaps 17.c6 bxc6  18.dxc6 and if Black wants to avoid the Bishop skewer on c5 he needs to defend his Knight with the ugly 18...Ndb8.  But I chose a different option.

This would probably have left me able to get the pawn on to d7.  I could also have increased the pressure by bringing a rook to b1 or d1 but I was getting a little impatient with my inability  to turn the screw so I played B-g5? with the next move in mind.

Black has a couple defences I think.  25...cxd6  26.Qxd6 Qxe5 defending the rook on b8 but allowing 27. Qxf8+ Bxf8  28.Bxf6+ winning back the queen and roughly evens.  Or he could play 25...fxg5 and White can choose between dxc7 d7 or Nb5 (N35 is invulnerable because dxc7 allows dual threats on b8 and f8).  But he chooses Qxe5?.

He really only has two options  at this point and neither of them are good. The game is essentially lost at this point.  He can bring is bishop back to F8 to create a buffer for his King but sacrifice the rook or move his King to E7 (not a good square for a King) so that his Queen can support the rook"

With the center closed white's dark-squared bishop looks to be boxed in after Bc2 -- the only viable move for the piece.  F3 will be a thematic break that will have to be played at the correct time.  White now also has the possibility of Nge2 followed by Nf4.

Namely will black overextend himself by this commitment to e4?  And can white unzip the f-file and perhaps develop an aggressive kingside attack?

472,21,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sicilian Defense.  This is by far my favorite response to e4.
473,21,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',? This is a weak move compared to the other lines as it allows black a speedy to have development of his B8 knight.
474,21,3,Qd2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPQ1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! blocks of the c1 bishop I think Qa4 is best in this position.
475,21,4,f3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Strange choice however it doesn't seem like it is too weakening as I can't use it to my advantage quite yet.  However it does have the downside of zero development and keeping the knight of its best square f3.  Nc3 is the best choice.
476,21,5,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq d6',?! not sure I like this move so much now as it is promoting an early trade of queens and I really don't want to do that here.
477,21,6,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I can take e4 but I don't really feel like it gives black much I can play e6 but I get an isolated pawn position from it.  e6 is probably best however I was uncomfortable with the positions if white decided not to trade. For instance white play e5 down the line I could be looking at a compromised king position.  I opt for d4 taking some and keeping the tempo.
478,21,7,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/3pP3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq e6',a6 was good but I wanted support d4 first besides the b5 knight isn't moving anywhere for now.

But where should my bishop go?  Be7 is playable but I don't feel like I get anything from it.  I should have played Bd6 here after fxe5 Bxe5and blacks position is good.  I opted for this because I had in my head that I wanted to play Nxe5 to challenge the queen and if I had played Bd6 I would lose my d4 pawn after Nxe5.
482,21,11,1Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/5ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1p3/3pPP2/N2Q4/PPPB2PP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Best was probably for white to take here fxe5 Nxe5 Qg3 Ng6 e5 Qe7.

First question here is what piece do you take with?  After Bxb4 Bxb4 Nxb4 Qb3 I don't seem much for black to continue with and things seem to be okay.  White could also choose to ignore the bishop on b4 and play something like Nf3.  After Nxb4 however Qb3 Qe7 black holds the initiative and soon has e4.

What can white do?...  Well there are few moves to stop the fork Nh3 is one.  But after Ne3+ Black runs into problems with Kc1 Qa5 Nb1 Rc8 or Ke2 Qa5 Nb1 Be6.  Any queen move Qf3 Qg3 loses the knight to Ne3+. Ke2 was played.

500,22,7,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now there are many versions to this continuation but this is my favorite.  Unlike my previous annotation it does prevent him from playing 5.Bb5.  At least I assume that he wanted to play that.
501,22,8,Be3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',"So he decides to play this instead.  I don't mind but I would have played 5.Bc4 if I were white.  As it allows me to develop my LSB and Right Wing so that I can castle Kingside.  Of course I see that he wants to castle Queenside.  Therefore I already feel that I have the advantage.  Many chess coaches have told me that it is far better to castle Kingside then Queenside.  However Master paulmorphy91 disagrees with this assessment.  In jsteven's1 annotation about ""Where and When it is Safe to Castle"" he says that Queenside Castling is often better then castling Kingside."
502,22,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',I decide to continue development and hope for a Knight exchange.  Afterall I feel that doubled pawns will strengthen my position this time. 
503,22,10,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I do not know why he played this because his e4 pawn is not hanging.  He might just want to develop but I do not think that this is normal development.  Instead I would have played 6.Bc4 and castled Kingside before this move.
504,22,11,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3nP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',At least I am getting a Knight Exchange but it is not what I had expected.  Instead he will take with the Queen but I will chase it around with my e pawn.

Although it took a long time this transposed from a Sicilian Defense into a King's Knight Opening.  As bwaa mentioned in my last annotation the timing also does not matter.  Before that I originally thought that the order did not matter but timing was critical.  BTW I am specifically alluding to transpositions.
506,22,13,f3,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',? I do not know why he played this but this should cause problems.  Now he has opened his King and it is no longer safe to Castle Kingside without exposing it.  On the other hand Castling Queenside should also leave his King Open but he has no choice now.  If he does not castle his King will also remain exposed.  Therefore I now feel that I have a big edge.

My goal is to win his a2 pawn for free but that will not work here.  I was thinking of 12.Bxa2 and if 12...Nxa2 13.Qxa2.  I did not think that the pawn could be protected.  In other words I thought that I was automatically going to win that pawn because there was nothing he could do to protect it but I was wrong.

In fact this is my loosing blunder according to damaestro.  Why?  This will enable him to win a free pawn.  Instead 17...Rfd8 was best as it would have protected my d6 pawn.  Therefore like my second game against blitzkov I went from no mistake to loosing in one move.

As Damaestro had mentioned our last game against each other I lost that first game by opening and putting a whole around that King.  This enabled him to get a Mating Net.  Therefore I still feel that I will win but am wrong.

Afterall Jack Stockel has told me that two connected pawns are very powerful during an endgame and often lead to a promotion.  However that is not going to happen and I no longer have an edge.

Afterall ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning position be careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and loosing the game"" as Jack Stockel would say.  Therefore I thought that damaestro had ""let his guard down"" and was going to loose but I am wrong for a third time due to miscalculation.

In the past I have mentioned that it is not a good idea to make a move without knowing why you did it.  In this case I was not paying attention so this is a mistake in it's own nature.

538,22,45,Bc1,b'2b5/5p1p/p4k2/KpBBp1p1/4P1P1/2P2P1P/PP6/2b5 w - -',In this position I am still trying to get the pawn back.  Afterall I am still basing it on what damaestro had told me after declining the draw offer.
539,22,46,3b3,b'2b5/5p1p/p4k2/KpBBp1p1/4P1P1/1PP2P1P/P7/2b5 b - -',He sees my intention and decides to advance his b2 pawn.
540,22,47,3Bb2,b'2b5/5p1p/p4k2/KpBBp1p1/4P1P1/1PP2P1P/Pb6/8 w - -',But I am not yet.  I am still attempting to win it back.
541,22,48,3c4,b'2b5/5p1p/p4k2/KpBBp1p1/2P1P1P1/1P3P1P/Pb6/8 b - -',And he still sees my intention. 
542,22,49,3Bc3+,b'2b5/5p1p/p4k2/KpBBp1p1/2P1P1P1/1Pb2P1P/P7/8 w - -',At this point it almost does not matter.  I figured that I won something back with this check.  Of course I felt that he would move something else to get out of check.  Little did I realize that he could get out of it with his King.  This is however another example of where your King is a powerful weapon during an end game.
543,22,50,h6,b'2b5/5p2/pK3k1p/1pBBp1p1/2P1P1P1/1Pb2P1P/P7/8 w - -',I figured that I would continue the advancement in order to get a promotion.  However I missed something important.  What did I miss?
544,22,51,3cxb5,b'2b5/5p2/pK3k1p/1PBBp1p1/4P1P1/1Pb2P1P/P7/8 b - -',?? This is it.  I just blundered another pawn after the exchange is over.  Now the game is lost for black as we will see towards the end.
545,22,52,Kg6,b'2b5/5p2/6kp/1KBBp1p1/4P1P1/1Pb2P1P/P7/8 w - -',Now I am just trying to protect my other pawns with this move.  Note: both of his bishops are threatening these pawns.
546,22,53,3b4,b'2b5/5p2/6kp/1KBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/P7/8 b - -',Of course now he is planning his promotion and this is the cornerstone.  Therefore he decides to advance his b3 pawn.  
547,22,54,3f6,b'2b5/8/5pkp/1KBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/P7/8 w - -',And I am not taking any chances so I decide to advance my f7 pawn.
548,22,55,3a4,b'2b5/8/5pkp/1KBBp1p1/PP2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 b - a3',This is where trouble begins and I see his goals.  After the advancement he plans to connect his a and b pawns.  As implied earlier connected powerful are very powerful and hard to beat.
549,22,56,3Kh7,b'2b5/7k/5p1p/1KBBp1p1/PP2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 w - -',I decide to retreat my King because I am worried that he might put it in a dangerous check if he makes it feasible to play Be4+.
550,22,57,3a5,b'2b5/7k/5p1p/PKBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 b - -',Now his pawns are connected.
551,22,58,3Kg6,b'2b5/8/5pkp/PKBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 w - -',Now I only played this move because I am trying to trick him into a draw by repetition but that plan is not going.  Why?
552,22,59,4a6,b'2b5/8/P4pkp/1KBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 b - -',Because he continues the pawn advancement.  Now I know that he is going to make a promotion but I have one more trick up my sleeve before resigning.
553,22,60,4Bd7+,b'8/3b4/P4pkp/1KBBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 w - -',In this position my intention was to stop his promotion but I forgot something.  Although in check my LSB is not directly horizontal to his a6 pawn so this is not a fork.  Therefore like my game against l-d-j he is still going to make an inevitable promotion despite this move.  As a result I resign after he gets out of check.  
554,22,61,4Kb6,b'8/3b4/PK3pkp/2BBp1p1/1P2P1P1/2b2P1P/8/8 b - -',"In the past Mr. Stockel has said ""Don't give things away"" but I did not understand the logic behind it.  I always thought that it was feasible to get something back after blundering material.  BTW I am specifically referring to pawns.  However I now know the reason for this.  In an endgame you are usually left with only a few pawns.  80% of the time one pawn makes the difference between winning and loosing according to elyhim.  That was proven in this game and it is the moral of this annotation.  Having said that I would like to thank Master elyhim for helping to make this annotation feasible."
555,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game starts as a wild King's Gambit. After some fascinating tactics in the early mid-game the game settles down into a level position and eventually a level pawn ending. But just when my colorful opponent has a draw within his sights he blunders and then there is no way back. Enjoy!
556,23,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So I copy his move
557,23,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"He opts for the King's Gambit. ""White offers a pawn to divert the Black e-pawn so as to build a strong centre with d2–d4. Theory has shown that in order for Black to maintain the gambit pawn he may well be forced to weaken his kingside. The King's Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings as it was examined by the 17th century Italian chess player Giulio Polerio. It is also in an older book by Luis Ramirez de Lucena.""

560,23,5,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',I protect the extra pawn.
561,23,6,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',He aims to break up my king side pawns.
562,23,7,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PppP/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I push again
563,23,8,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Knight comes forward. There is an interesting variation now 5...h5 6. Bc4 Rh7 (to protect f7). I don't know any other opening when the first piece developed in the black army is his king's rook! I opt for something else.
564,23,9,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I am giving back a pawn but his pawn on h4 is going to be weak.
565,23,10,Nxg4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So he takes the pawn
566,23,11,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I attack h4.
567,23,12,h5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/7P/4PpN1/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',There is a logic to this hanging onto his h pawn. However the post-match analysis gives this as a mistake. On the world opening database on Gameknot there are 19 games with this position only 1 continued with h5 and black won that. Kleifges Matthias (2175) vs. Meyer Gerd1 (2055) continued with 7. h5 Bh4+ 8. Nf2 Qg5 9. d4 Nf6 10. Qf3 Ng4 11. g3 Bxg3 12. Qxg3 fxg3 13. Bxg5 Nxf2 14. Rh4 Rg8 and black is a clear pawn up.
568,23,13,Bh4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/4PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I throw in the check
569,23,14,Nf2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/4Pp1b/8/PPPP1NP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',His wandering knight retreats.
570,23,15,Qg5,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6qP/4Pp1b/8/PPPP1NP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I continue as in Kleifges Matthias (2175) vs. Meyer Gerd1 (2055)
571,23,16,d4,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6qP/3PPp1b/8/PPP2NP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',So does he

Post-match analysis claims this is a mistake and suggests 10. Qf3 Ng4 11. Rxh4 Qxh4 12. Bb5+ c6 13. Bc4 Ne3 14. Bxe3 fxe3 15. Qxe3 Qxh5 16. Nc3 Qh2 17. O-O-O Qxg2

620,23,65,3f5,b'8/ppp1k2p/3p4/3P1p1P/P1P5/2P1K3/6P1/8 w - f6',I advance my pawn.
621,23,66,3Kd4,b'8/ppp1k2p/3p4/3P1p1P/P1PK4/2P5/6P1/8 b - -',And just when it looks like a draw he goes badly wrong. His king is needed on the king-side to protect his pawns and counter attack my pawns. There is no way through for his king on the queen-side and he has to make an embarrassing retreat but by then the position is lost. Computer analysis gives 34.

Opposite-flank castling tends to favor whichever side has more midgame attacking possibilities and with the half-open f file the situation looks like it would favor Black at the moment (as it very often does in this opening).

Development is just about even though White is playing more aggressively whereas Black has a better central presence but more threats to respond to.

804,29,14,1Bxg7,b'2k1r2r/pppq2Bp/2nb4/1B2pb2/3p4/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I think it would have been better to just move the Bishop back to g5 rather than opening the g-file for Black's heavy pieces.
805,29,15,1Ne4,b'2k1r2r/p1p3qp/2pb4/4pb2/3pN3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Let's take a second to analyze. Black has the bishop-pair (though his DSB is pretty worthless at the moment) and some beautiful open lines against the WK. His center is decent and he has better activity but he'll have trouble in an endgame due to his worse pawns. White on the other hand lags in development but has a solid position and a very strong Knight at e4. His other more lackluster pieces can also be quickly activated by initiating a queenside attack. I'd give Black a very slight edge here but only if he can convert his activity quickly.
806,29,16,1Bh3,b'2k1r2r/p1p3qp/2pb4/4p3/3pN3/3P1N1b/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',? A few moments after this move I decided it was probably a mistake. It's intended to provoke 15.g3 but 15.Ng3 is a far superior way to eliminate the threat; forcing Black to move the Bishop again and clearing e4 for a Queen or Rook. I'm not sure what the correct move for Black was in this situation--14...Rhg8 15.Ng3 e4 looks interesting--but I'm pretty sure the text is inferior.
807,29,17,1Nxd6+,b'2k1r2r/p1p3qp/2pN4/4p3/3p4/3P1N1b/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',? Not only trading a good Knight for a bad Bishop but also forcing his own hand as to the response to the Kingside threat. As I said above 15.Ng3 was much better allowing pressure on the backwards e5 pawn and gaining tempo. This move is where it all goes south for White.
808,29,18,Ref8,b'2k2r1r/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3p4/3P1NPb/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',Tying the Queen to the defense of the Knight and putting indirect pressure on the very weak f2 pawn. This also threatens to win material outright with ...Bg4! White's choice to trade off his Knight has left him struggling to find enough material to defend against Black's onslaught down the open files.
809,29,19,1Nh4,b'2k2r1r/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3p3N/3P2Pb/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b - -',Basically forced although 17.Nd2 was worth a look aiming for the e4 outpost.
810,29,20,1Rf4,b'2k4r/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3p1r1N/3P2Pb/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',?! Trying to be clever and gain time to play ...Rhf8 but this aggressive move isn't particularly sound; 18.Ng2 or 18.Re4 are both effective counters. Probably 17...d5 or 17...Rf6 were better ideas.
811,29,21,Rhf8,b'2k2r2/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3pRr1N/3P2Pb/PPP2P1P/R2Q2K1 w - -',This was the planned move and now additionally Black is hoping for an exchange on f4 followed by Qh5 giving him a chance to set a nasty trap for the WQ. Ng2 is no longer an option right away but 19.Qe2 or 19.f3 are both fine.
812,29,22,2Qh5,b'2k5/p5qp/2pp4/4p2Q/3p1r1N/3P2Pb/PPP2P1P/R5K1 b - -',Critically clearing the way for the Ra1 to get into action but this Queen is actually on really thin ice--she must be exceptionally careful not to get stuck on Black's side of the board with nowhere to go.
813,29,23,2Bg4,b'2k5/p5qp/2pp4/4p2Q/3p1rbN/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R5K1 w - -',! Closing the trap. The WQ has exactly one place she can run to.
814,29,24,Kc7,b'4Q3/p1k3qp/2pp4/4p3/3p1rbN/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R5K1 w - -',Look carefully. At this moment White has exactly one way to save his Queen from the carefully-prepared snare. Of course he can't play 22.gxf4?? since 22...Bd7+! wins the Queen. The only way to save her is 22.Qa8 where after 22...Kb6 23.Qb8+ Ka6 she can escape through d6. Obviously at no point in this line does gxf4 become an option since if it's played without the WQ guarding g6 gxf4?? Bh3+ is mate in two.
815,29,25,2Kf1,b'4Q3/p1k3qp/2pp4/4p3/3p1rbN/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4K2 b - -',?? Not good enough. White avoids the various discovered-check lines and flees from the mating threat but leaves his Queen in the lurch.
816,29,26,2Rf8,b'4Qr2/p1k3qp/2pp4/4p3/3p2bN/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4K2 w - -',0-1. With Q+B vs R+N Black will have an easy time cleaning up the remaining White defenders so White resigns. Many thanks for a great game grandpoobah! Comments are much appreciated; thanks for reading!
817,30,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Larson opening not extremely common but at the same time nothing too out there. My opponent is a club mate of mine so I know his style reasonably well and sometimes he switches to this one of his old favourites
818,30,1,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',!? I quite like the idea behind this move it seeks to prevent whites usual play which tends to involve e3 f4 ect and this leaves white with an interesting situation where the 'normal' sort of moves aren't going to past muster
819,30,2,f3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3P2/PBPPP1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',!? And in fact this is likely the best response f3 with the idea of following up with e4 actually my opponent told me an amusing anecdote about a postal game he played where without looking at the position properly he chucked out e3?? And promptly resigned when the post returned with his opponents move
820,30,3,Bh5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/8/1P3P2/PBPPP1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Bf5!? Was another option but I didn't want to have to waste a move retreating my bishop after 4.e4 dxe4 5.Qe2 c6 6.fxe4 Bb6 where I think white is slightly better
821,30,4,e4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/4P3/1P3P2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq e3',Natural and obvious anything else would make f3 a meaningless move
822,30,5,c6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/4p3/1P3P2/PBPPQ1PP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',Solid and best Qb5+ was threatened which would have won the bishop and other replies like a6 allow white to freely capture on e4 with an extra threat on b7 
823,30,6,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/4p3/1PN2P2/PBPPQ1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Qxe4 is a little awkward for white since black responds with ...Bg6 and then the queen is forced to play to c4 where she is misplaced and the pawn on f3 is taking the most natural developing square away from the g1 knight. Instead the text is a developing move that threatens to win back the pawn 
824,30,7,exf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/8/1PN2p2/PBPPQ1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',6...Nf6 was also possible with a similar idea as before trying to show that the pawn on f3 and queen on c4 would be unfavourable for white but I don't think it's really that bad especially with a pair of knights having been exchanged. So instead I decide to cash in my extra pawn and I'm left with a caro kann like structure but white has a good lead in development. I can't remember what the name of this gambit is but it seems perfectly playable to me
825,30,8,h3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/7b/8/1PN2N1P/PBPPQ1P1/2KR1B1R b kq -',Looking to expand on the kingside which would come with a gain of time by attacking my bishop
826,30,9,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/8/1PN2b1P/PBPPQ1P1/2KR1B1R w kq -',I choose to avoid losing any tempo retreating my bishop and instead exchange it for a potential attacker of whites
827,30,10,Ba3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q7/6PP/bPN2Q2/PBPP4/2KR1B1R w kq -',I am a pawn up so exchanges are good for me as well as that this could potentially turn into an opposite sides castling position in which case it's useful to take away one of the defenders of the white king and lastly this bishop had the potential to be a powerhouse staring directly into the black kingside
828,30,11,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2n2P1/7P/bPN2Q1B/PBPP4/2KR3R w - -',?! Castling right into the midst of whites attack isn't a very wise this to do it may have been better to have to have castled queen side or maybe even held off on castling at all which would keep white guessing 
829,30,12,Nxc3,b'r4rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q5P1/7P/bPn2Q1B/PBPP4/2K3RR w - -',Now that white has moved the rook off of the d file I feel it's alright to initiate the exchange of knights
830,30,13,Qb5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/1q2n1P1/7P/1PP4B/PKP1Q3/6RR w - -',Whites attack against my king is a lot more advanced than mine is which has not even started so offering an exchange of queens makes sense 
831,30,14,1c4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/1q2n1P1/2P4P/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR b - -',White declines by by attacking my queen with a pawn however as a result there are now possibilities of checks along the now weakens dark squares 
832,30,15,b5,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1pq1n1PP/2P5/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR w - b6',Finally starting a counter attack against the white king having said that whites attack has obviously progressed a lot further than mine has never the less I don't see any immediate danger so I think black should be alright since most endgame should be favourable
833,30,16,2g6,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/4p1P1/1pq1n2P/8/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR b - -',Initiating contact between the pawns however black is better in the sense that worst case scenario I can always bale out with a draw by perpetual check and also if whites attack isn't decisive then black will be better in the endgame
834,30,17,2Kh8,b'r4r1k/p4ppp/4p1P1/1pq1n2P/8/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR w - -',I had considered simply drawing here but decided I would first move my king so that there are no pawn captures with check I figured I would leave it white to show weather or not he can come up with a correct break through
835,30,18,2gxf7,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1pq1n2P/8/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR b - -',Probably one of a couple of correct moves I had wondered at this point weather white might have tried h6 which looks dicey
836,30,19,2Nc4+,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1pq4P/2n5/1P5B/PKP1Q3/6RR w - -',I had a change of heart no and decided I may as well go for the draw after all white was the higher rated player and I've succumbed to too many successful breakthroughs before to be completely relaxed with all the fire power directed at my king. Besides this move guarntees at least a draw for black whereas white must find the correct moves that don't lose
837,30,20,2bxc4,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1pq4P/2P5/7B/PKP1Q3/6RR b - -',Allowing the knight to a3 would have been deadly this is correct
838,30,21,2Kc1,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1p5P/1qP5/7B/P1P1Q3/2K3RR b - -',Ka1 looses to ...Qc3+Kb1 bxd 
839,30,22,2Qa3+,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1p5P/2P5/q6B/P1P1Q3/2K3RR w - -',And now I expected Kb1 where I was simply going to give perpetual check and declare a draw by 3 fold repetition instead I was surprised by white running his king out into the open
840,30,23,2Kd1,b'r4r1k/p4Ppp/4p3/1p5P/2P5/q6B/P1P1Q3/3K2RR b - -',?? In chat I asked what he was thinking that made him play this and he said that Kb1 would lose to 26...bxc however I pointed out that white has a very effective defence in the form of Qe5!! Which admittedly isn't an easy move to find since it involves a backward diagonal defence which is something that is among the hardest to see in chess. For example 26Kb1 bxc?? 27.Qe5!! Rab8+?? (Rxf7 is better but it is already dead lost and that just admits it) 28.Ka1 and black has no mates and must now give up a further rook to avoid being mated himself after the text black has an easy win as opposed to a draw by perpetual check. In fact I think it is now something mate in 7-8

That with the accompanying analysis was a real treat to read through and seeing it was when I first realised just how much preparations GMs do. What I like about this gambit is that black gets a fierce kingside attack where white must step very carefully however even more than that black gets long term positional compensation so even if white parries blacks kingside attack the resulting positions are often drawn anyway since black will usually have long term activity even into the endgame and also such positions often result in opposite coloured bishop endings. Not to mention the opening is considered sound and playable even by today's GMs and finally the fact that human intuition is actually more important than computer analysis which is always a bonus

Having said that white will be able to tear apart blacks queenside without any trouble and white is still a pawn up after all but I was happy with my position at this point.

Instead I should have played 4...Nf6 or 4...Nc6 because it is said that you are supposed to develop Knights before Bishops.  That is because you know where the K is placed but not the B.
955,35,8,dxc5,b'rn1qkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/2P5/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is often played with the Open Siclian so this is very similar to that variation.  However it is still not an Open Siclian.  Note: timing is critical and playing something by move 2 or 4 determines what kind of opening it is called.  At least that is what I think but could be wrong.
956,35,9,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/1p1npppp/p2p4/2P5/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"? I should have thought better then this.  I am clearly trying to develop.  However this is a mistake because I placed my knight in a bad spot and it is the wrong knight.  As I always demonstrate it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.  Therefore 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6 were better.  However 2...Nf6 is better then 2...Nc6 because I want to be able to castle on the right wing as opposed to the left wing (Kingside Castling instead of Queenside Castling.)  However 5...dxc5 was best because it gets back a pawn.  As a result I inadvertently gave away a free pawn and it is not a gambit or a deflective sacrifice.  Note: Jack Stockel would say ""Don't give things away""."

In this position he will have trouble developing his b1 Knight unless he places it on the rim (plays Na3).  Having said that I am also not in very good shape due to lack of developing.  Note: My right wing (Kingside) is completely undeveloped.  Now he has an edge because he has the opportunity to castle but I do not yet.  However this move will delay some of his development.

What am I talking about?  I decide to take back his pawn.  Now I am very lucky that he did not see mistake.  Why?  In this position he could have played 6.cxd6 and then I am down a pawn.  Instead he makes a bigger mistake by cramming his b1 Knight as I had mentioned earlier.

This is very similar to and reminds me of SM (Scholars Mate).  Now I am not going to be intimated.  Like my second game against blitzkov I am going to kick his Queen with my Knight.  This move however is a mistake that I am not going to make.  Therefore what am I going to do?  That will be explained in a little while.

With a B&Q mate and it is the most common type of mate in chess.  In fact these are the most dangerous pieces when combined.  BTW my last two sentences are based on what Jack Stockel has taught me.  Because of this move I will mate him with 9...Qd1# and I was not planning on this mate in one.  That is why this annotation is called an Unplanned Mate in One.

That is because you usually loose when you plan to mate in one because it often comes in the form of unsound aggression or cheap tricks.  Or you are forced to work to win a game that you should really loose.  However the other way does not force you to struggle.  For example I mated my opponent very easily this time.
963,36,0,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Hi all! This was a casual game played here on GK recently. Mistakes are made on both sides but I'm annotating it to showcase more than anything else the importance of playing calmly and accurately developing pieces to good positions before attempting to orchestrate any sort of attack. Enjoy!
964,36,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White is playing Benko's opening a reasonably popular reserved opening that focuses on quick kingside development. It generally transposes into some form of King's Indian attack (with e4 and d3) Catalan opening (with d4 and c4) or English (with c4 and usually d3). In this case however Black chooses to immediately contest White's control of the h1-a8 diagonal. This is an uncommon line but absolutely playable.
965,36,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pppppp/1pn5/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is basically forced though 2...d5 is also possible if fairly awkward.
966,36,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pppppp/1pn5/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"At all times but especially obvious in the opening move efficiency is critical. Every move you make should have a clear purpose. Time wasted in the opening can lead quickly to disaster if your opponent is making purposeful efficient moves--thus the oft-quoted saying ""don't move a piece twice in the opening""."
967,36,4,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Delaying the development of the Bishop to b7 but this is fine. Black's KB will probably land at e7 to stay out of harm's way while he prepares to castle.
968,36,5,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So far a very reserved game. White's King is safely tucked away already and nothing has moved into the center ranks yet for either player.
969,36,6,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1pn1p1p1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',If Black intended to put his Bishop on g7 why play 3...e6? Most of his pieces are free to develop at this point; he should be doing so with 4...Bb7 or 4...Be7 or 4...Nf6 etc. This move is our first example of a simple waste of time--not to mention that it creates a big weakness at f6.
970,36,7,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1pn1p1p1/8/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',White needs to develop his queenside now; this is the most direct way to do so.
971,36,8,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p2p1p/1pn1p1p1/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',This blocks off the h1-a8 diagonal for White's Bishop; perhaps now Black intends to play his own Bishops to d7 and g7 Ne7 and push c7-c5? That's fine but it's not as though White is putting on pressure that Black would need such a plan to free himself from. This move doesn't allow any new developmental opportunities for Black and it doesn't have a clear purpose. Therefore it is a waste of a move.
972,36,9,Bg5,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p2p1p/1pn1p1p1/3p2B1/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',With Black's kingside pawns all on light squares White invites a trade of dark-square Bishops to badly weaken the Black defensive position.

974,36,11,Be3,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p4p/1pn1ppp1/3p4/3P4/4BNP1/PPP1PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',This particular retreat serves two purposes: first it reinforces d4 to allow White to develop Nbd2 in preparation for c4. Second it also leaves the opportunity open for Qd2 with an eye to penetrating on h6.
975,36,12,h5,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p5/1pn1ppp1/3p3p/3P4/4BNP1/PPP1PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq h6',Black leaves uncertainty behind and announces his plans to storm the White kingside. But how can he be successful with only one piece off its home square and his King still sitting in the center of the board?
976,36,13,g5,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p2pp/3P4/4BNP1/PPPNPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Again developing moves like ...Bd6 or ...Ne7 would be better preparation for an attack than just pushing up all the pawns. Even ...Ba6 putting pressure on e2 would be stronger. Now Black's moves have a purpose (attacking the White King) but we must ask--is it even possible for these moves to accomplish that purpose?
977,36,14,h4,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p2pp/3P3P/4BNP1/PPPNPPB1/R2Q1RK1 b kq h3',This is why the army is not comprised just of pawns. This one move puts an immediate end to Black's kingside assault as now 9...gxh4 is met by 10.Nxh4 and there's no way for Black to get the Knight out of the way to put either the g- or h-file to any use.
978,36,15,g4,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p3p/3P2pP/4BNP1/PPPNPPB1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Maintaining the tension would at least have made White have to think about defending his King as the game progressed. The text simply closes off all avenues of attack.
979,36,16,1Ne1,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p3p/3P2pP/4B1P1/PPPNPPB1/R2QNRK1 b kq -',Heading for d3 and eventually f4. Of course 10.Nh2 was an option with intentions of playing 11.f3 and breaking up the Black pawn storm but why go that route when the Black pawns are doing such an admirable job of shielding the White King from all harm?
980,36,17,1Nh6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p5/1pn1pp1n/3p3p/3P2pP/4B1P1/PPPNPPB1/R2QNRK1 w kq -',All right the first ten moves are done and we're leaving the opening. Let's analyze the situation. White is mostly developed. His pieces are looking a bit awkwardly-placed (mostly that Ne1) but he can actually move around pretty much as he pleases and has lots of queenside potential as well as a good central presence. Black on the other hand has just now touched his second piece in ten moves! He has lots of kingside space but his pieces pose no threats and his King is looking rather exposed behind his advanced wall of pawns. 
981,36,18,Nf5,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p1n1p/3P2pP/3NB1P1/PPPNPPB1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',This is a good place for this Knight though Black is still badly behind in development.
982,36,19,1Bf4,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p1n1p/3P1BpP/3N2P1/PPPNPPB1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',??! This is a very speculative sacrifice. The alternative of 12.c3 Nxe3 13.fxe3 was perfectly fine opening the f-file for White's Rook against the weak f6 pawn. With this move White invites Black to take the d4 pawn in exchange for allowing White to open the center with initiative likely continuing with 12...Ncxd4 13.c4 Bb7 14.e4 where Black will struggle to hold off White's attack but with careful play will probably be all right if he can get his King into the relative safety of the queenside fast enough. That all said... it would certainly liven up an otherwise quiet game.
983,36,20,1Bh6,b'r1bqk2r/p1p5/1pn1pp1b/3p1n1p/3P1BpP/3N2P1/PPPNPPB1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black declines the proffered pawn instead making a counter-offer of a Bishop trade.
984,36,21,1c3,b'r1bqk2r/p1p5/1pn1pp1b/3p1n1p/3P1BpP/2PN2P1/PP1NPPB1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',With trades on the table White chooses to reinforce d4 and allow his Queen a diagonal to develop on rather than move his Bishop yet again.
985,36,22,1Nxf4,b'r1bqk2r/p1p5/1pn1pp2/3p1n1p/3P1NpP/2P3P1/PP1NPPB1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This Knight has been looking at f4 as an outpost ever since Black played ...g4.

987,36,24,Rb8,b'1rbqk2r/p1p5/1pn2p2/3Npn1p/3P2pP/2P3P1/PP1NPPB1/R2Q1RK1 w k -',Getting off the h1-a8 diagonal that is about to open up though better would probably have been 15...Bb7 with an eye for ...Qd7 and ...O-O-O.
988,36,25,a6,b'1rbqk2r/2p5/ppn2p2/3Npn1p/3P2pP/2P3P1/PPQNPPB1/R4RK1 w k -',Black continues pushing pawns even with nothing to gain! This is simply another wasted move.
989,36,26,1Rad1,b'1rbqk2r/2p5/ppn2p2/3Npn1p/3P2pP/2P3P1/PPQNPPB1/3R1RK1 b k -',White is now completely prepared to tear open the center with devastating effect.
990,36,27,1b5,b'1rbqk2r/2p5/p1n2p2/1p1Npn1p/3P2pP/2P3P1/PPQNPPB1/3R1RK1 w k -',Counterplay generally defined is making threats to offset a weakness elsewhere on the board. With Black's weak kingside trying to make play on the queenside is reasonable--but we've already seen just how bad pawns are at carrying out an offensive all by themselves while there are still lots of pieces on the board.
991,36,28,1b4,b'1rbqk2r/2p5/p1n2p2/1p1Npn1p/1P1P2pP/2P3P1/P1QNPPB1/3R1RK1 b k b3',White shuts down the queenside push just as easily as he did the kingside. Black has made eleven pawn moves despite having only one pawn past the center line. White has made five--each White pawn that has moved has only been touched once.
992,36,29,1Qd6,b'1rb1k2r/2p5/p1nq1p2/1p1Npn1p/1P1P2pP/2P3P1/P1QNPPB1/3R1RK1 w k -',Flip the board a couple times and view this position from both sides. Get a feeling for how stringy and precarious Black's position feels in comparison with White's.

If Black's position didn't feel dangerous before the next several moves demonstrate exactly how loose it was as White takes it apart in seconds. Also possible was the immediate 19.Ne4 Qf8 20.Nxf6.
994,36,31,2Ne4,b'1rb1k2r/2p5/p1n2p2/1p1Nqn1p/1P2N1pP/2P3P1/P1Q1PPB1/3R1RK1 b k -',Every single White piece is participating in the attack. The center is about to break wide open; Black can maintain something close to material equality with 20...Rh6 or 20...Rf8 but White may simply choose not to crush down on f6 until his Rooks both occupy the d-file and his Queen is on b3. There is no adequate defense and no time to rush to the queenside. Material is still nearly equal but there is no hope left for Black with three critical pieces sitting useless on his back rank.
995,36,32,2Rh7,b'1rb1k3/2p4r/p1n2p2/1p1Nqn1p/1P2N1pP/2P3P1/P1Q1PPB1/3R1RK1 w - -',? This oversight allows White's victory to come more easily but it is a technicality. As I said above Black was already lost.
