I have to admit I'm not too much of a gambit player with the exception of my favorite opening - the Queen's gambit. Indeed 1.d4 d5 2. c4 is not even considered much of a true gambit as there are extremely few lines where white does not regain the pawn. So I deemed this tournament good experience playing with both sides of a ""true"" gambit. Not being too experienced with gambits I predictably got blown away in several games quite quickly while managing to swipe a few draws from some tough competition. In this game I've got the white army and when my opponent delays development with pawn moves I decide to offer up another pawn for some open lines against his king. Let's see how it works out..."

86,4,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the Smith-Morra gambit offering a pawn to black in order to open up lines for both bishops and the queen.
87,4,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',According to the Masters database this is black's response 96% of the time - no real reason for black to decline here.
88,4,4,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Here is the main line and true gambit as white could immediately recover the pawn by playing 3.Nf3 Nc6 4. Nxd4 and after black takes the knight white can take with the queen without getting as easily pestered and chased by the minor pieces of the black army.
89,4,5,dxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is again the main line - taking the gambit pawn. Another main line is 3...g6 declining the gambit and allowing white a strong center after 4. cxd4 but black can hit back immediately with 4...d5! challenging the center with support from the black bishop coming.
90,4,6,Nxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Natural and the only real possibility and the point of playing the gambit - a lead in development and open lines. This was the starting position of the game.
91,4,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops naturally keeping in check the e pawn which could cramp black's position if advanced (eventually).
92,4,8,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White continues developing bringing out the knights first to their most natural squares leaving possibilities open depending on how black proceeds with his defensive pawn structure.
93,4,9,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',One of the main two possibilities here with the other being e6 which has the advantage of blocking the path of the white bishop to f7 once it almost certainly deploys on c4. White can then create a battery with her queen on b3 or also attack the square via Ng5 and Qf3. The advantage of d6 (and disadvantage of e6) is that the e5 square becomes quite weak and with a white pawn established there black's position can become cramped. Perhaps this is why the most common is actually to play both e6 and d6 one after the other on moves 5 and 6. Of course this has the disadvantage of blocking the exit of BOTH of the black clergy beyond one square limiting their scope.
94,4,10,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White clears the way for castling and develops the next most logical piece as its presence here on this square is by far superior to any other.
95,4,11,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Again most common here would have been e6 which is played about 70% of the time with second being a6 and then Nf6. Yet the move has produced solid results and is logical enough creating a place for the black bishop now that it's been locked in by the d6 pawn. He could greatly influence crucial squares such as e5 and put pressure on the Nc3 especially if the white b pawn were to ever move.

My plan was to play Qb3 but after 7...e6 and then an eventual ...Na5 White will likely end up losing his powerful white king's bishop. So I wanted to stop Na5 and deploy the queen behind the b-pawn gaining space as well at the same time. I played this move quite quickly as I decided to be aggressive and give it a try.

I was hoping he would be greedy and take the pawn which he did. Some computer analysis gives black an edge if he simply ignores the pawn and plays Bg7 Nf6 or f5. I would be partial to Bg7 as the undefended white knight would be pinned to the rook. A sample line would be - 7...Bg7 8. Qb3 (defending the knight and attacking the f7 pawn)...e6 9. Be3 a6 10. Rd1 b5 11. Be2 Bb7 12. O-O Rc8 where black would still have the extra pawn but white enjoys more space and attacking possibilities still maintaining a lead in development.

It is immensely strong as the forking action of the queen threatens the Nb4 and the pawn on f7. Note that black does not simply give the pawn back if he saves his night with 8...Nc3 as after 9. Bxf3 Kd7 the knight on g7 is overpowered by queen and bishop but even stronger is 10. Nb5 (where mate is threatened with Qe6) Qa5+ (to create a square for the king) 11. Bd2 Qb6 12. Bc3 and black will lose his rook without compensation.
And 8...e6 of course hangs the black knight instantly (his only developed piece as well while white would still have 4!)"

In return white's attacking pieces would be exchanged and black would have an ok game. A blunder of course would be Bxd5 thinking that the attack can continue on f7 as of course 9...Nxd5 and white would have lost one of his best pieces and black would have just about equalized.
Perhaps black is also hoping for exd5 which gives black a fighting chance still. Ex. 9. exd5 Qa5 10. Bb5+ Bd7 11. Bxd7+ Kxd7 12. Ne5+ Ke8 13. O-O Bg7 and black's position is not enviable but not yet totally lost."

Black is saying to white - fine take my knight with your flimsy pawn but then I'll take your annoying bishop that you keep preserving! Black is hoping for either 11. Ba4? whereby 11...b5! would keep black in the game or Bxc6 which would allow black to almost equalize.

Having said that the longer it analyzes this move the more it likes it. What I particularly like about it is the fact that the e-pawn has ""become"" all the gambited pawns having traversed the d c and b files. He is now just one square from promotion having devoured three members of the black army successively. At this point I knew this must be the right move but hadn't actually worked out the conclusion.

This is where I wondered whether I had a forced win as I was stuck for a while on the idea of equalizing material with Qxb5+ but this would have left me with only a very small advantage because after 13...Qd7 14. Qxd7+ Kxd7 15. Ne5+ (to avoid doubled pawns in the end game) Ke6 and white doesn't really have any advantage as black will soon develop his king-side pieces and should comfortably draw.

Looking at that 15th move of Ne5+ I realized that if I simply leave the pawn on b5 black is going to have a very uncomfortable time defending the renewed threat on black's weakest square f7. This was the move the computer prefers on move 12 but it seems to work out about the same..."
108,4,24,1Ne5,b'r2qkbnr/1b2pp1p/6p1/1p2N3/8/1QN5/P4PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',"!! A right combination of patience and bravery is required when attacking. Weaker players (myself included) often look for ""checking"" moves to continue attacks but often it is far stronger to cut off an escape square for the king. This move cuts off d7 and threatens immediate mate by Qxf7. Black has a few ways to stop immediate mate but none of them are any good and lead to horrible positions thus my opponent honorably resigned. Here are a few of the variations:

13...e6?? 14. Qxb5+ Bc6 15. Qxc6+ Ke7 16. Qb7+ Kc5 17. Qb5+ Kd4 18. Be3+ Kxc3 19. Qb3++
13...Nh6?? or 13...Bd5?? both lead to 14. Qxb5 Bc6 15. Qxc6 Qd7 16. Qxd7++
The only non-forced mates involve moves by the black queen the best of which being 13...Qa5 which could lead to 14.Qxf7 Kd8 15. O-O Qxc3 16. Bf4 Bh6 17. Rhd1 Kc7 18. Rac1 Qxc1 Rxc1 and mate to follow with the coordinated white pieces bearing down on the helpless black king undefended by his castles still on their starting squares.

Thanks to my opponent for a fun game. Please rate and comment feedback is much appreciated.

288,9,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I know this is the Scandinavian Defense. It has been played at the highest levels with some success. I don't know if it's in favor now but this much I do know: I've never respected black's first move. Because to me he invariably has to waste a tempo in repositioning the black queen. Now the flexibility in the opening with opportunites for transitions to me has never been worth the tempo. Since I pay little attention to variations of basic openings I just develop normally and play the board. That's probably why I'll never be a really really good chess player. But I have beaten some really good chess players! Go figure. Anyways I just distrust anything that to me seems not so efficient. There diatribe all done. ;)
289,9,2,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',As white my play is likely too passive but I'll explain my reasons for the moves I choose.
290,9,3,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This I have seen countless times as white so I assume this is all book. But from this point I have no idea what is or is not book. I've seen enough to know that black can get a kingside attack that I don't like as white so I do something a little odd. Here is the thing for me: It's a given that black is going to reposition the queen. SO why chase it? It's going to move anyways so I'd rather spend the extra move to do something a little odd with one of my own pieces...
291,9,4,Be2,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Perhaps it's passive but I'm going to take two moves to do something with my bishop here.
292,9,5,Bf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Not exactly the safest place for the bishop but it does a few things I want it to do.
293,9,6,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I think Black must be following book moves here because he's created as usual a place for his Queen to escape to. But from this point on I am simply going to develop and invite black to attack my kingside. Now with this pawn structure I would think black would wish to castle kingside. As I said I don't know the book lines. But in the game that's not what black ultimately does.
294,9,7,Nge2,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Just developing. Not the best place for the knight I know but you'll understand what I will do in a bit.
295,9,8,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2N2B2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Looks like good developing move for black.
296,9,9,d3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Freeing up the dark-squared bishop and controlling c4 and e4 for the moment. I have no plan yet just developing and castling soon. 
297,9,10,e6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I kind of expected that. I've seen that and ...Nd7 a number of times in this position.

299,9,12,Nbd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Yeah yeah. What is black's plan now? I am still not sure. So let's make a few moves to find out.
300,9,13,Nd4,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/3N4/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',This is a probe. The knight is heading to b3 but I want to see if black wishes to hang onto his white bishop. It's an empty threat really. But it will tell me something. Also  black could play an immediate Ne5 which would result in the loss of the white bishop. He probably should have done that.
301,9,14,Bd6,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/3N4/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Wow. He's really ready to give up the white bishop. Is that in the book moves? Problem is I don't want to take it with this knight even though it would remove some of the current pressure on white's king. Because I played passively my pawn structure is more cramped and for the early midgame I want to hold onto my knights longer especially since I've invited black to attack on the kingside. I don't need another pawn over there coming down. (Nxf5 pxf5) If black wishes to crash down on my kingside he's going to need a bit more umphh and I'm not going to help him do it.
302,9,15,1Nb3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/8/1NNP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Well other than taking the bishop which some of you will say I should have (fine I know I know) I instead put it here because I am going to want to control d4.
303,9,16,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now I recently played a game where my opponent ignored such a threat and he paid for it. I won't do the same thing. 
304,9,17,1h3,b'r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Black should consider a sacrifice now to open the King side up and pressure my King. Despite my knights way on the other side of the board I wonder if such an attack right now which was not made whether it would have had me scrambling the rest of the game. I'll never know now unless one of you choose to analyze this position for black.
305,9,18,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Looks like black will attack on the Kingside. Wow look at all those pieces bearing down on my kingside or about to. And the pawns will join in with rooks behind them. RIGHT now black needs to aggressively go for it. But he does not.
306,9,19,1Be3,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Ha I don't want a7. That will just lose the bishop and I'd say despite my knights black could defend the loss of the pawns. But in a while I'll sacrifice a knight against those black queenside pawns. A little analysis here would have been interesting to see if after Bxa7 b6 Bxb6 and black recaptures with the knight if there would be anything white could do to take advantage of the lack of pawns there. Instinctively I think not; but again I don't have a computer to do any analysis with. Anyone out there that wishes to do that you're welcome to.
307,9,20,1Kb8,b'1k1r3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I don't have a computer chess program to tell me if black could have just left his King safely where it was and used this tempo to get his own attack rolling. He's been reacting and perhaps he just doesn't have a plan. Someone said on one of their games that a bad plan is better than no plan and that's right especially for amateurs because it's how we get better at it.
308,9,21,1Qe2,b'1k1r3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Partially prophylactic. That rook on d8 is no longer targetting my queen indirectly after this. Remember that's a half open file for black. Later on tactics could have been unpleasant with my queen on d2 hence my move. Also this allows my queen to be on a more useful diagonal and connects the rooks. I need to keep supporting the bishop too. For all of those reasons that is why I made this move. Now perhaps the better players would have already had a plan moves ago but I waited to make a plan until black castled. If I learned the openings better I'd be able to make my plans sooner. Do I really think of all this stuff while I play? Most times yes. I seldom calculate. Yeah. I'm lazy. ;)
309,9,22,1Bh2+,b'1k1r3r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP1QPPb/R4RK1 w - -',Okay I don't understand black's thinking here. Why does he want my King on h1? I don't see any obvious threats right now. It's like giving me a free move after he retreats his bishop. At this point I don't fear his knights and now the black bishop can't check me again. The only thing I would not like right now is is if black could crash his pawns down on the kingside with his rooks beind them. It's worth noting that black could have played Ne5 for several moves now getting rid of my white bishop. Because he didn't it comes back to haunt him.
310,9,23,Bd6,b'1k1r3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP1QPP1/R4R1K w - -',That made no sense to me. Instead of it being black's turn now it's my turn again in this same position save the white king is on h1 instead of g1. I think this was a wasted move especially since those kingside black pawns have a long way to go before they contribute to pressuring my kingside.
311,9,24,1a4,b'1k1r3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/P7/1NNPBB1P/1PP1QPP1/R4R1K b - a3',Now at this point my plan was to get the b pawn rolling too. And perhaps use one of those two knights to open up black's queenside. Here is a basic lesson: most chess books advocate countering in the middle or other wing when one's opponent launches an attack on one side of the board. The reason for this is because one's counter play and own attacking chances can cause your opponent to leave off from his attack to defend. But in this position black doesn't do this. Instead he tries to oppose what I will do.
312,9,25,1a5,b'1k1r3r/1pqn1ppp/2pbpn2/p4b2/P7/1NNPBB1P/1PP1QPP1/R4R1K w - a6',I am suspicious of this move. Perhaps black doesn't like all my pieces pointing his way; but if so why didn't he try to trade some off earlier? You know what and I bet you'll say the same thing: when we lose games it's often because our opponent beats us to the punch. Now in order for me to achieve my goal what square do you think it is that I want to control? If you guessed b4 you're right. Because if I have b4 then further pushes will become very possible and very uncomfortable for black.

It loosens up black's king's safety and black has not forseen yet that I'll let a knight jump up there regardless of the extra protection for a5.... Black ought to get rid of that white bishop in this position but instead...

316,9,29,1h5,b'1k1r3r/2qn1pp1/1ppbpn2/p4b1p/P7/1N1P1B1P/NPPBQPP1/R4R1K w - h6',Black finally begins to assault the white king but...

319,9,32,1b4,b'1k1r3r/2qn1pp1/2pbpn2/p4b1p/PP6/3P1B1P/N1PBQPP1/R4R1K b - b3',This position is looking bad for black now; white has torn open black's king pawn with his help. I think accurate defense can still save black but it wasn't to be.

I wanted to keep the knight because of the forks; but at this point I thought well the knight will pry the position open because of the threats and the bishop won't necessarily. Surely black would take the white knight with his black bishop because of the danger. And I wanted that so my rooks could harass that king sooner rather than later. But black had other ideas.
321,9,34,2Nxb4,b'1k1r3r/2qn1pp1/2pbpn2/5b1p/PN6/3P1B1P/2PBQPP1/R4R1K b - -',Black MUST take with the black bishop because of the dual threat here; Nb6+ forking the queen and Nxc6 forking the rook. Ne5 fails now due to the first fork; black can only stop both by taking with the bishop. But by this point I had over five minutes and black was under a minute on his time. He got confused trying to keep all the lines straight and sadly made this unfortunate move:
322,9,35,2Qa7,b'1k1r3r/q2n1pp1/2pbpn2/5b1p/PN6/3P1B1P/2PBQPP1/R4R1K w - -',Well he resigned after white's next move.
323,9,36,2Nxc6+,b'1k1r3r/q2n1pp1/2Nbpn2/5b1p/P7/3P1B1P/2PBQPP1/R4R1K b - -',And he wasn't rated that low. This is why I don't mention his name. We all blunder it's part of the game. I blunder. More important to me here is I really wish I could have seen the bishop take my bishop take and then the scramble by black to defend the King as I brought my rooks into play. Would I be able to get enough material back after the knight sacrifice? Because it looks like black's king will escape to safety. I wish I had a chess computer so I could look more closely at 20. ...Bxb4. But except for the last blunder and a few miscues black played well. I could have made better moves too. But that's what makes chess FUN! ;) Hope you enjoyed this one.
324,10,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',White begins with the non-committal King's Knight controlling e5 but otherwise allowing Black to occupy the center. Most often (in my experience anyway) Black will reply with 1…Nf6 – a solid developing move waiting for White to show his hand first (and typically following a KID setup).  Black however responds in classical fashion with the confident advance of the Queen’s Pawn to occupy the center thereby controlling e4 and freeing the Queen’s Bishop for development.  
325,10,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',With the immediate advance of the c-pawn White opens with the Reti proper – threatening Black’s d-pawn and offering the gambit to either displace Black’s central pawn or cause him to lose time in defending it.

At this point I decided to move forward with the more dashing and perhaps questionable d4 for the large center effectively transitioning from what began as a flank opening to a more classic approach. In the event that Black pushes Queenside with b5 White now has extra options for redeploying the bishop.

However I decided upon the “throw all you got at the King and hope something sticks” approach with 8.f4 – defending our intrepid Knight while gaining the broad center with nice open lines.

Again I debated with which approach I should take – should I play e5 and go with the slow but more solid approach or should I try to develop quickly and hope to overwhelm my opponent?
I decided to move forward with Nc3 – grasping more control over the center with a simple developing move. Although the e-pawn is defended by both knights if one can be immediately displaced then the central pawn could fall. However as we will see White has an interesting option available to create a strong imbalance while his pieces are mobile and his King relatively safe. Instead of 9…h6 I believe Black would have been safer with 9…O-O to be followed up with 10.e5 Nd5 11.O-O.

(11.Bxe4 12.Nxe4 also looks weak for Black even if not immediately losing the game). Stronger would have been either 11…Bd7 or 11…Nbd7 to develop the Queen’s pieces while still keeping control of h5. Although Black would have been up a Knight for two Pawns White still would have retained a strong initiative with mobility space and control with a complex and interesting game ahead.
337,10,13,1Qh5+,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1b1p1/2b1B2p/7Q/3PnP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',
338,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I open with the King's Pawn Opening and this is going to become a Ruy Lopez.
339,11,1,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now he responds in a very interesting way that I have not seen before.  I am used to something like 3...a6 after the Ruy Lopez but not this move.
340,11,2,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',In this position I have a choice between exchanging his Knight for mine or nabbing his e pawn.  However I think this is best.  Why?  If 4.Nxe5 4...Qg5 so he eventually exposes my King or makes it unsafe to castle Kingside because if 5.c3 5...Qg2.  It would force me to play 5.g3 and that is something I will not allow.
341,11,3,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I also could have castled at this point.  However I like this move better at the moment.  Why?  If 5.0-0 5...Qe7 is a feasibility.  If that happens my e pawn is left hanging.  In addition I have to play this move sooner or later so why not now?
342,11,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B6/3pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In the meantime he starts developing.  My goal however is to delay his development by forcing him to cram his own pieces and keep some of them stuck on the 8th rank.  So I start by pinning his Knight.  After he breaks the pin I castle Kingside.
343,11,5,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p4n2/1B4B1/3pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',After I castle he decides to kick my LSB.  Then he will chase it again forcing me to make another run just before he castles Kingside.  However I will pin his e7 pawn.  I intend to keep it that way because I believe that it will give me a longlasting strategical advantage.
344,11,6,1Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p4n2/1p4B1/3pP3/1B1P4/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',After he castles I decide to continue with development.  However he is going to attack my LSB twice.  I understand that he wants to gain tempii but there is one thing that I don't understand.  What is it?  Why does he want to open up his King in order to do this?  In my view 11.Bh4!? and 12.Bg3!?  Note: I have lost a couple of games by leaving my King open.
345,11,7,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1bppbp2/p4n1p/1p4p1/3pP3/1B1P2B1/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',After I retreat he decides to fianchetto his LSB.  In this position that move is very effective for two reasons.  First nothing is blocking his diagonal like his Knight.  Second this is the only way for him to develop his LSB as there is still a pawn on c7.
346,11,8,1Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/1bppbp2/p4n1p/1p4p1/3pP3/1B1P1QB1/PPPN1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Because I am completely developed I decide to go ahead and bring my Queen out.  I am attempting long term tactics (not immediate mating threats).  The only question then is at what point is it a good time to bring the Queen?
347,11,9,1Bb4,b'r2q1rk1/1bpp1p2/p4n1p/1p4p1/1b1pP3/1B1P1QB1/PPPN1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"As a result of my last move he decides to attack my Knight but that does not bother me.  However I am going to make one mistake that will blunder away a free pawn and still leave my Knight hanging.  I thought that I could just end the attack with that one move but as he would say ""It's not so easy""."
348,11,10,1c3,b'r2q1rk1/1bpp1p2/p4n1p/1p4p1/1b1pP3/1BPP1QB1/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"? This is the mistake.  In fact he said that ""this move benefits me as I now get rid of my weak pawns"".  I think that I should just protect with my a1 Rook at once not later."
349,11,11,1Rad1,b'r2q1rk1/1bpp1p2/p4n1p/1p4p1/4P3/1BbP1QB1/P2N1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',After which my Knight is still under attack but my Rook is now attacked by the exact same piece.  However this fork is just a nuisance as I now defend both with this move.  The problem however is that I gave something away due to miscalculation.
350,11,12,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2p2/p4n1p/1p1p2p1/4P3/1BbP1QB1/P2N1PPP/3R1RK1 w - d6',And he takes advantage by attacking my e pawn.  Of course I do not mind so I accept the exchange.  The only problem is that I am still behind so I need a little more then just an even exchange.
351,11,13,1Qh5,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2p2/p6p/1p1n2pQ/8/1BbP2B1/P2N1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',But this is why I wanted the exchange.  Of course he could have played 17...Bxd5 as opposed to ...Nxd5.  I mean this was another possible response in which case this move would not be feasible.  In this position I am actually trying to get something back a pawn.  But with this choice my Q LSB and DSB will eventually become a mating threat as we will see later on.
352,11,14,1Kh7,b'r2q1r2/1bp2p1k/p6p/1p1n2pQ/8/1BbP2B1/P2N1PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',So he has to defend that pawn in some way.  However I will win it back pretty soon with my d Knight.
353,11,15,1Ne4,b'r2q1r2/1bp2p1k/p6p/1p1n2pQ/4N3/1BbP2B1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',And here we go.  It starts off with a Knight fork so he can no longer defend g5 without giving away his DSB.  
354,11,16,2Nxg5+,b'r2q1r2/1bp2p1k/p6p/1p1n2NQ/3b4/1B1P2B1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Although it looks like an even exchange.  He cannot get out of check by retaking.  Why?  Because 20...hxg5 is an illegal move and I kept that in mind when I played 19.Ne4.
355,11,17,2Kg7,b'r2q1r2/1bp2pk1/p6p/1p1n2NQ/3b4/1B1P2B1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',So this is how he gets out of check.
356,11,18,2Nf3,b'r2q1r2/1bp2pk1/p6p/1p1n3Q/3b4/1B1P1NB1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',After seeing the damage that I caused I decide to take advantage by kicking his DSB since it gives me tempii.  As Master elyhim told me gaining tempii is like taking money from your opponent and depositing it into your own bank.
357,11,19,2d4,b'r2q1r2/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p1n3Q/3P4/1B3NB1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',So I kick it up a knotch because I know that I can get very tough and threaten mate.  This way I feel that I am correcting some of my own mistakes given that I previously blundered a pawn.
358,11,20,2Nc3,b'r2q1r2/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p5Q/3P4/1Bn2NB1/P4PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',And he decides to attack my Rook but that does not bother me.  Instead I will make a move that prevents him from taking my Knight.
359,11,21,2Bf4,b'r2q1r2/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p5Q/3P1B2/1Bn2N2/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',"This is the move that I am alluding to.  That's right if 23...Nxd1?? 24.Qxh5+ and mate is inevitable.  Why?  After 24.Qxh5+ 24...Qg8 (forced) 25.Qh7#.  BTW my goal was not to immediately mate or trick him.  I am just trying to keep my Knight protected without immediately losing tempii.  In addition I am trying to prove to Mr. Stockel that I am really thinking and I am succeeding in doing so.  After this move my opponent said ""You are getting really nasty"" and he was trying to prevent the mate.  BTW when I played this I looked at other feasiblilties as previous commentator mentioned in a different annotation.  How?  He cannot take my Rook in this position.  And I kept that in mind when I lost against the Master Mater by grabbing one of his Rooks."
360,11,22,2Rh8,b'r2q3r/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p5Q/3P1B2/1Bn2N2/P4PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',! With that in mind this is best because he is still going to gain tempii given that my Rook remains attacked.
361,11,23,2Rde1,b'r2q3r/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p5Q/3P1B2/1Bn2N2/P4PPP/4RRK1 b - -',So this is where I lose tempii as I now have to keep my R protected.
362,11,24,2Nd5,b'r2q3r/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p1n3Q/3P1B2/1B3N2/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',And he moves back in order to attack my DSB but that does not bother me.  In addition I am not going to lose tempo this time.
363,11,25,2Be5,b'r2q3r/1bp2pk1/p4b1p/1p1nB2Q/3P4/1B3N2/P4PPP/4RRK1 b - -',This is why.  Instead of retreating I decide to force an exchange and it does not affect my position since everything is even.  Therefore I have nothing to lose with this exchange. 
364,11,26,Qe7,b'r6r/1bp1qpk1/p6p/1p1nN2Q/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',In this position I do not know what he is trying accomplish unless he wants to test me.  If he does however I am about to pass it with flying color.  This move will enable me to threaten his Queen with a discover attack.
365,11,27,2Nc6,b'r6r/1bp1qpk1/p1N4p/1p1n3Q/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Now some people might think that black can just take the Knight but that is not feasible.  Why?  As I mentioned on move 26 his Queen is attacked so if 27...Bxc6 28.Rxc7.  When you think about it this is actually a double attack as my c6 Knight and e1 Rook are attacking his Queen.  
366,11,28,2Qd6,b'r6r/1bp2pk1/p1Nq3p/1p1n3Q/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',So he responds with a double attack against my Knight.
367,11,29,2Re7,b'r6r/1bp1Rpk1/p1Nq3p/1p1n3Q/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',"Ok why did I move here?  It looks like I am just giving something away but that is not the case in this position.  The thing is that he cannot play 28...Qxe7 due to my Knight.  And he cannot capture my Knight because if 28...Qxc6?? 29.Qxf7# which is mate.  I kept that in mind before making this move.  BTW I am not attempting mate or cheapo tactics.  So what am I trying to do in this position?  Well I want to keep my Knight protected since it still remains attacked.  At first I thought that my Knight was inevitably lost but Jack Stockel would say ""Think about things"".  And l-d-j told me to look at other feasiblities in a previous annotation.  This move prevents the ""Fight or Flight"" response while protecting my Knight.  That is because ""To take is a mistake"" at the moment.  In fact Jack was quite amazed that I found this move.  ""Can you believe it?  He is actually threatening mate"" is what Mr. Stockel said."
368,11,30,2Kf6,b'r6r/1bp1Rp2/p1Nq1k1p/1p1n3Q/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',So this move is his only option to prevent a mate in one.  Because he is out of danger my Rook is back in harms way.  However this will not last long as I am going to win a free pawn and place him in check.  With that in mind I go from a pawn behind to a pawn ahead.
369,11,31,Kg5,b'r6r/1bp1RQ2/p1Nq3p/1p1n2k1/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',Forced.
370,11,32,3Re5+,b'r6r/1bp2Q2/p1Nq3p/1p1nR1k1/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',"Now here comes real trouble.  Although it might not seem forced Mr. Stockel's only option is to give up his Queen for one of my Rooks.  Because if 30...Kh4 31.Qh5#.  And if 30...Kg4 31.Qf5+ 31...Kh4 (forced) 32...g3# so mate is still inevitable.  This particular position is a little different then the actual game.  Whereas in the actual game we arrived at a position that I thought was mate and had announced checkmate.  However ""It's almost mate"" is what he said.  My opponent told me that there was only one other option and the check had occurred on the eighth rank.  In that case he only had one move.  What was it?  Bringing the Queen on the seventh rank.  In any case he was still forced to give up his Queen for one of my Rooks.  BTW your chances of winning Jack's Queen is like getting a Royal Straight Flush in a poker game.  I only won his Queen one time before this game.  And it happened about 2 years ago.  After the game was over he told me that I easily should have won that game with the played move.  As we will see later on however I will make one mistake that turns a win into a loss in the game itself."
371,11,33,h5,b'r6r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1nN1kp/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',I do not know what he wants in this position.
372,11,34,3Ng6,b'r6r/1bp2Q2/p5N1/1p1n2kp/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',So although it appears that best was 32.Qg6+ that was not an option in the actual game.
373,11,35,3Rh6,b'r7/1bp2Q2/p5Nr/1p1n2kp/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',"?? This time however my Knight is actually attacked so I have to find a way to protect it.  I cannot let him take because if 33.Rxg6 33...Qxg6 is not an option due to his King.  Therefore I thought that 33.Ne7 was the only move.  Although it is not the case with this position in the actual game this was the losing move which is why I marked this with two question marks.  When the game was finished Jack and I went over the game.  This was the opportunity to exchange material.  In my game however it was the Rook that could be exchanged for my LSB as it was pinned.  That happened several moves after I exchanged his Queen for my Rook the position looked something like Ke8 ...Rf7 and Bg6 without anything to break the pin easily.  However my only focus was on promoting the pawn and that is what sealed my fate.  It is simply due to the fact that I was only concentrating on a pawn promotion as opposed to the position.  As a result I was not thinking hard enough.  When everything was said and done he was actually testing me to see if I was thinking but this time I failed the test.  ""This is what I mean when I tell you to start thinking"" is what he said.  If I was thinking a little more outside of the box I would have seen the pin and taken action.  And that would have been enough to win. "
374,11,36,3Ne7,b'r7/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1n2kp/3P4/1B6/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',Since this position differs from the actual game I recorded moves as just other careless mistakes that just lose the game not the true blunder.  
375,11,37,3Nc3,b'r7/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p4kp/3P4/1Bn5/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',Until now I did not see this but after 33.Ne7 his Knight was attacked by my LSB so he had to protect it in someway.  Why?  Exchanging would only harm his position given that he is still behind.
376,11,38,3d5,b'r7/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P2kp/8/1Bn5/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',You might have thought that I was trying to mate but that is not the case here.  In this position my only goal is to promote one of my pawns but he is not going to allow that.
377,11,39,3f4+,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P2kp/5P2/1Bn5/P5PP/5RK1 b - f3',Now I am trying to bring my King out so that he can become active.  Note: In the endgame your King is a powerful weapon.
378,11,40,3g3+,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P3p/5P1k/1Bn3P1/P6P/5RK1 b - -',And I am still trying to activate my King.
379,11,41,3Kf2,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P3p/5P2/1Bn3Pk/P4K1P/5R2 b - -',"? Because he just got out of check I am trying to establish the ""opposition"" with our King's.  But this is a mistake as it gives away a free pawn."
380,11,42,3Kf3,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P3p/5P2/1Bn2KP1/P6k/5R2 b - -',Now that we were opposition I am trying to promote a pawn by placing my King in between one of them.  BTW this is a little similar to how the position looked in the very end of our game.  That will be explained later on.
381,11,43,3h4,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p6r/1p1P4/5P1p/1Bn2KP1/P6k/5R2 w - -',Of course he is trying to prevent my pawns from promoting and he will be successful as we exchange material.  This time exchanging material will benefit his position even though he's still behind.  Otherwise white gets an inevitable pawn promotion.
382,11,44,4Rc1,b'3r4/1bp1NQ2/p7/1p1P4/5P1r/1Bn2K2/P6k/2R5 b - -',? So I decide to attack his Knight but this is a mistake as it enables him to connect his Rooks.  Note: This did not happen in the actual game.  However as I mentioned earlier I was recording position as though white I was trying to lose.  That is because I lost the actual game as soon as I missed the opportunity to exchange material. 
383,11,45,4Nf5,b'7r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1P1N2/5P1r/1Bn2K2/P6k/2R5 b - -',I figure that I would take advantage by attacking his Rook.  He responds however by placing me in check.  
384,11,46,4Rh4h3+,b'7r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1P1N2/5P2/1Bn2K1r/P6k/2R5 w - -',Now 42.Kg4 is my only move in this position.
385,11,47,Ne2,b'7r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1P1N2/5PK1/1B5r/P3n2k/2R5 w - -',Then he decides to attack my Rook.
386,11,48,4Re1,b'7r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1P1N2/5PK1/1B5r/P3n2k/4R3 b - -',I however reattack.
387,11,49,4a3,b'7r/1bp2Q2/p7/1p1P1N2/5PK1/PBn4r/7k/4R3 b - -',After his retreat I am still determined to promote but he will do anything to prevent that.
388,11,50,4d6,b'7r/1bp2Q2/3P4/pp3N2/5PK1/PBn4r/7k/4R3 b - -',In this position I am attempting to exchange material since I am ahead but he has a way to prevent that.
389,11,51,4c5,b'7r/1b3Q2/3P4/ppp2N2/5PK1/PBn4r/7k/4R3 w - c6',Now he is one step closer to promoting then me.  However let's see if I can something about that.
390,11,52,4a4,b'7r/1b3Q2/3P4/ppp2N2/P4PK1/1Bn4r/7k/4R3 b - -',In this position I am not just going to pull my LSB back.  If I do I do not think that I would be able to prevent him from promoting because he can connect his pawn.  Most importantly his pawns are protected by his Knight and h Rook on the third rank.
391,11,53,4c4,b'7r/1b3Q2/3P4/pp3N2/P1p2PK1/1Bn4r/7k/4R3 w - -',"?? However he still decides to attack my bishop and I am not surprised.  I knew that he would do this but I thought that what I did was worth a try.  I realized that I was in trouble and do not think that I caused any more damage by trying to get out of a bad situation.  As my coach would say ""When you are in trouble concentrate.  Try to find a way out of trouble.""  However this is terrible blunder as we will see later on."
392,11,54,Bd5,b'7r/5Q2/3P4/pp1b1N2/P1p2PK1/2n4r/2B4k/4R3 w - -',After I retreat my LSB he decides to attack my Queen.  In the actual game he did this and won my Q back earlier.  That will be explained later on.
393,11,55,Rg8,b'6r1/8/3P2Q1/pp1b1N2/P1p2PK1/2n4r/2B4k/4R3 w - -',Now the game is officially lost for white as he is going to win my Queen.  As we all know in this position my Queen is pinned by his Rook so it looks like he will retake with the Rook.  In the actual game however this is not how it happens.  Instead he won it with a fork between my King and Queen.  He did so with his LSB and it was very similar to a family fork.  However my R was not attacked.  The actual position looked something like Kh1 Qd5 ...Bf3+ without any material to protect the Q and K.  That way I would have to lose my Queen.  From then on I sort of knew that black was going to win even with best play.  But I did not want to resign until I knew that the game was actually lost for white.    
394,11,56,4Ne7,b'6r1/4N3/3P2Q1/pp1b4/P1p2PK1/2n4r/2B4k/4R3 b - -',So I decide to attack his Rook.  I knew that I would lose my Queen as mentioned on move 48.  But I did not want to give him a free Queen so I made a decision to exchange it for one of his Rook.  In the actual game this did not happen.  There were no exchanges and he only had one rook.  As noted earlier he won my Q with a Bishop fork.
395,11,57,bxa4,b'8/8/3P2N1/p2b4/p1p2PK1/2n4r/2B4k/4R3 w - -',"After this however he gets a free pawn.  And a pawn promotion is officially inevitable.  Normally I would just be able to recapture with my Bishop.  But if 51.Bxa4 51...Nxa4 so he would win a piece for my pawn.  The rule is ""exchange pawns not pieces"" as master elyhim would say.  At this point I realize that I do not stand a chance against him so I resign.  In the actual game however I did not resign right after an exchange and the position was completely different.  So what happened?  Well I was left with two connected pawns and my King in between those pawns.  However he was left with a P+K+LSB.  Therefore if I were to promote he would have taken one of my pawns with his LSB.  So it looked like whites pawns were on something like f3 and g2 with white's King on f2.  And blacks bishop looked like it was something like b3 so that he would take if you were to promote.  But it also appeared that black's remaining pawn was on something like d4 so that you could not stop it.  With that in mind his remaining pawn was becoming more powerful and I did not have anything to stop his promotion.  Consequently I resigned.  Remember: What happened in the game is more important then any of the positions that I recorded.  Believe it or not my description of the actual game is the analysis.  The most important moral of this game is to think about all of the positions.  If I had analyzed this game and strategized a little more I definitely would have won.  "

584,18,16,d6,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bpp1/p2ppn1p/8/N1PBPP2/1P4P1/P5BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Finally releasing the LSB fourteen moves into the game. By playing this move rather than ...b5 Black also signals a change in direction: he will now break on e5 rather than d5 giving him some much-needed space.
585,18,17,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bpp1/p2ppn1p/8/N1PBPP2/1P4P1/P5BP/R2Q1R1K b - -',I strongly considered 15.e5! here and I think it may well be stronger than the text. It creates a weakness on f5 and a potential one on d5 but it also further compresses the Black forces especially the LSB. The main reasons I decided against it were the light-squared weaknesses it creates and the fact that it drives the Black Knight to d7 from which it can defend b6 (and indeed has little else to do). The text move has the advantage of completely forestalling any aggression against the White King for the foreseeable future.
586,18,18,1e5,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bpp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/N1PBPP2/1P4P1/P5BP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Black finally breaks but I don't know that this is the right time. His d-pawn is now horribly backwards and an easy target for the White forces. Perhaps 15...Rb8 followed by ...b5 would have been stronger.
587,18,19,1Bb6,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bpp1/pB1p1n1p/4p3/N1P1PP2/1P4P1/P5BP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Blocking the b7 pawn getting the Bishop out of harm's way and harassing the BQ. Any time you can respond to a threat at the same time as you create one of your own it's a gain of tempo.
588,18,20,1Qc6,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bpp1/pBqp1n1p/4p3/N1P1PP2/1P4P1/P5BP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Here Black does the same thing: the BQ is no longer threatened and White's e-pawn is now hanging.
589,18,21,1Qe2,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bpp1/pBqp1n1p/4p3/N1P1PP2/1P4P1/P3Q1BP/R4R1K b - -',Probably 17.Qc2 was better but the text shows that the WQ is headed for e3 to provide support for the f-pawn.
590,18,22,1Bg4,b'r4rk1/1p2bpp1/pBqp1n1p/4p3/N1P1PPb1/1P4P1/P3Q1BP/R4R1K w - -',Of course.

592,18,24,1Rac1,b'r4rk1/1p1nbpp1/pBqp3p/4p3/N1P1PPb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R2R1K b - -',White lines up on the c-file with the BQ getting his Rook out of the corner and inviting Black's next move for better or for worse...
593,18,25,1exf4,b'r4rk1/1p1nbpp1/pBqp3p/8/N1P1Ppb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R2R1K w - -',Black tears the game wide open. Now White either sacrifices the integrity of his kingside even further with 20.gxf4 or accepts an isolated d-pawn and the loss of an exchange by retaking some other way. Take a broad look at the position here: White has a definite spatial advantage but Black should have decent counterplay against the White King. Remember this feeling for a few moves.
594,18,26,2Rxf4,b'r4rk1/1p1nbpp1/pBqp3p/8/N1P1PRb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K b - -',??! I looked at this move for a long time trying to work out all the variations and then decided to simply go for it. Take a few minutes reviewing this position: White is sacrificing material for positional gains in theory but the situation is very complex. The main things to notice are: Black has a three-piece shishkabob lined up for him along the c1-g5 diagonal; White has a discovered attack ready to go against the Black Queen and Black's LSB is unguarded. What happens now?
595,18,27,2Bg5,b'r4rk1/1p1n1pp1/pBqp3p/6b1/N1P1PRb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K w - -',I actually think 20...Bh5 was better. Since White has three major pieces on the vulnerable diagonal Black can win an exchange even if he plays ...Bg5 a move later. So he might as well get his LSB to safety.
596,18,28,2e5,b'r4rk1/1p1n1pp1/pBqp3p/4P1b1/N1P2Rb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K b - -',White unleashes an attack on the BQ. Note that Black could delay his response to it with 21...Bxf4 22.Qxf4 Qc8 since White would be unwise to attempt to double-down: 21...Bxf4 22.Bxc6?? Bxe3 23.Bxb7 Bxc1 24.Bxa8 Rxa8 25.exd6 leaves White with far too little for his material.
597,18,29,2Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/1p1n1pp1/pB1p3p/4P1b1/N1P2Rb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K w - -',The only safe square! Suddenly b7 looks vulnerable and d6 is undefended.
598,18,30,2exd6,b'r1q2rk1/1p1n1pp1/pB1P3p/6b1/N1P2Rb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K b - -',White ties up a loose end and gives himself a powerful pawn spike in Black's territory.
599,18,31,2Re8,b'r1q1r1k1/1p1n1pp1/pB1P3p/6b1/N1P2Rb1/1P2Q1P1/P5BP/2R4K w - -',! Gaining a tempo to reposition the Rook.
600,18,32,2Qd4,b'r1q1r1k1/1p1n1pp1/pB1P3p/6b1/N1PQ1Rb1/1P4P1/P5BP/2R4K b - -',White's Queen must not stop defending f4.
601,18,33,2Qxf4,b'r1q1r1k1/1p1n1pp1/pB1P3p/8/N1P2Qb1/1P4P1/P5BP/2R4K b - -',Remember how you felt a few moves ago that White had a small spatial advantage but Black should have counterplay? Compare that with the position now. White has only a Bishop and a pawn for his Rook but his positional advantages are now huge.
602,18,34,2Ne5,b'r1q1r1k1/1p3pp1/pB1P3p/4n3/N1P2Qb1/1P4P1/P5BP/2R4K w - -',Black brings his Knight up to a more useful position and defends his LSB--guarding the critical d1 square. Of course ...Nxb6 wouldn't get anything useful done since it just invites White to fork the Black Queen and Rook.
603,18,35,2Bd5,b'r1q1r1k1/1p3pp1/pB1P3p/3Bn3/N1P2Qb1/1P4P1/P6P/2R4K b - -',White can't get his Rook on the d-file easily so he picks an easier target: f7. First he pins the pawn so it can't escape.
604,18,36,2Rf1,b'r1q1r1k1/1p3pp1/pB1P3p/3Bn2b/N1P2Q2/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',Not yet an overwhelming attack but White is keeping the initiative by forcing Black to defend himself.
605,18,37,2Qg4,b'r3r1k1/1p3pp1/pB1P3p/3Bn2b/N1P2Qq1/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K w - -',!? I think this might be Black's best shot in the position. White has a massive attack rolling down the board spearheaded by the passed d-pawn. A Queen exchange could lessen Black's defensive burdens. However he does give up another pawn making White's center that much stronger...
606,18,38,2Bxb7,b'r3r1k1/1B3pp1/pB1P3p/4n2b/N1P2Qq1/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',! Of course there's no reason to take the Queen right away.
607,18,39,2Rab8,b'1r2r1k1/1B3pp1/pB1P3p/4n2b/N1P2Qq1/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K w - -',The only safe square!

609,18,41,2Qxf4,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/pB1P3p/3Bn2b/N1P2q2/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K w - -',Black takes the initiative while he has a chance.
610,18,42,Nd3,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/pB1P3p/3B3b/N1P2R2/1P1n2P1/P6P/7K w - -',This is a great spot: White's Knight is largely cut off from the world and cannot jump to c5 to support a d6-d7 advance. Black's problem is that he has only Rooks to defend the storm of pawns and minor pieces pressing down on him.
611,18,43,3Rf1,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/pB1P3p/3B3b/N1P5/1P1n2P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',This seems best to prevent checking tactics on the back rank with which Black could equalize.
612,18,44,3Ne5,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/pB1P3p/3Bn2b/N1P5/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K w - -',Unfortunately for Black this is probably his only good move. He cannot stay on d3 much as he might like to because he has no way at all to defend d7 thanks to White's powerful Bishops. 
613,18,45,3Bc7,b'1r2r1k1/2B2pp1/p2P3p/3Bn2b/N1P5/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',The beginning of the end. Of course Black's Rook can't flee to c8 because then Bb7 wins it.
614,18,46,3Nc5,b'4r1k1/2B2pp1/p2P3p/2NBn2b/1rP5/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',! The White Knight makes his triumphant return and what a return it is. Not only does he now threaten to win the Black Rb4 (and Black is powerless to stop it without losing *some* material) but he also threatens to simply push through with his passed d-pawn. Black cannot meet all the threats posed by the swarm of White minor pieces and the pawn they escort.
615,18,47,3Ng4,b'4r1k1/2B2pp1/p2P3p/2NB3b/1rP3n1/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K w - -',This is a last-ditch effort to distract White from his goals: Black threatend ...Ne3 with a fork but White has other plans.
616,18,48,3d7,b'4r1k1/2BP1pp1/p6p/2NB3b/1rP3n1/1P4P1/P6P/5R1K b - -',1-0. Black's threats hold no weight; his pieces are uncoordinated and he's about to lose at least a Rook so he resigns and rightly so. Many thanks to mgwili for a fantastic game! Any comments anyone has on this game or on my analysis would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure I've missed things in my analysis and I'd very much like to know what those things are.

664,20,25,1Qxf4,b'3r1rk1/pBp2ppp/1b3n2/4R3/5q2/2NP3P/PPP3P1/R2Q3K w - -',bye bye DS bishop and one point in material and weakened castled position. No way to sort it out just a really bad move on my part and there were better options. Gotta live with it.
665,20,26,2Ba6,b'3r1rk1/p4ppp/Bb3n2/2p5/5q2/2NP3P/PPP1R1P1/R2Q3K b - -',Suddenly not confident or happy with the game. Just want my LS bishop back in the action though it wastes time and tempo to do so and to what ends will it even serve me I know not. 
666,20,27,2Kg1,b'3r1rk1/p1b2ppp/B4n2/2p5/5q2/2NP3P/PPP1R1P1/R2Q2K1 b - -',I regret so much not getting rid of that DS bishop. 
667,20,28,Ng3+,b'3r1rk1/p1b2ppp/B7/2p5/8/2NP2nP/PPP2RPq/R2Q1K2 w - -',I kind of think moving one of his rooks to E8 then doing something like this would have been been better but this is bad enough for me. 
668,20,29,2Qf3,b'3r1rk1/p1b2ppp/B7/2p5/8/2NP1Q1P/PPP2RPq/R3K2n b - -',Oh God how I hate this type of situation. A feeling of regret constantly on the defense. 
669,20,30,2Kxf2,b'3r1rk1/p1b2ppp/B7/2p5/8/2NP1Q1P/PPP2KPq/R7 b - -',Finally down in material. At the beginning of the game being down a point or two is not so much an issue as it now as the game goes into the end. To me anyway. In some gambit it is common to be down in material and either get it back or have some positional advantage. Here is lost my lead and in a positional quagmire. 
670,20,31,Ra4,b'5rk1/p1b2ppp/B7/2p5/r7/3P1Q1P/PPP1NKPq/R7 w - -',Now he just moves moves around and attacks unguarded pieces. it is an annoying way to be played against -as if I will just leave the piece there for him to take- but it has a negative psychological effect on the person on the defense. Getting tired and bored and frustrated. Losing the fighting spirit and need to do something. 
671,20,32,a5,b'5rk1/2b2ppp/8/p1p5/r1B5/3P1Q1P/PPP1NKPq/R7 w - a6',A blunder for black here. But I have to wait. 
672,20,33,Be5,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p1p1b3/r1B5/P2P1Q1P/1PP1NKPq/R7 w - -',Again that attacking of an unguarded piece. It is okay I guess but better had the piece been totally unguarded or there been a pin involved from which there was no escape. By forcing me to move my pawn to C3 he helps me to insure the eventual death of his rook. 
673,20,34,Bd4+,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p1p5/r1Bb4/P2P1Q1P/RPP1NKPq/8 w - -',The check. I really feel he could have set things up to be more devastating against me. Some guys can't resist that check. Of course I acknowledge my weaker position based on my blunder earlier. Like so many of my lost games it is not that my opponent seems to play so much better as it is that I have moments where I play inexcusably bad and deserve what I get. Bad bad boy!
674,20,35,cxd4,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p7/r1Bp4/P2P1Q1P/RPP2KPq/8 w - -',Didn't want to trade the knight. Now in positions and situations where I have to do things I do not want to do. Hate that.
675,20,36,3b3,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p7/r1Bp4/PP1P1Q1P/R1P2KPq/8 b - -',But here here is a break. I saw this earlier but had no time to work on it. He actually blocked his rook in a few moves ago by advancing his A-file pawn. He probably saw it and was trying to figure out how to get out of the problem thought there is really no escape. I have my doubts now that he is a Romulan. Maybe a Klingon. 
676,20,37,3Rxc4,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p7/2rp4/PP1P1Q1P/R1P2KPq/8 w - -',Sure best move in this situation.
677,20,38,3dxc4,b'5rk1/5ppp/8/p7/2Pp4/PP3Q1P/R1P2KPq/8 b - -',Now I am back in material lead with a passed pawn. He no doubt feels bad over the rook loss and I get a second wind a sense that my opponent is not beyond making the same type of blunders I am. Yes he is castled but he cannot stay that way in this situation. He has to move his pawns down to go for a promotion. Which he does effectively as we shall see soon enough. 
678,20,39,Qe3+,b'4r1k1/5ppp/8/p7/2Pp4/PP2qQ1P/2P2KP1/3R4 w - -',"I think a mistake on his part (though we know the end of the story already don't we) since he is one point down and in a better position to tie me up and keep me from getting my pawns up. See this type of move a lot. Trying to hurry things along or the idea of ""getting in the other guy's face"" sort of approach. Of course it does advance his pawn and it is protected by the rook so hard to say it is totally bad in any sense. Damned Klingons!"
679,20,40,3Ke2,b'4r1k1/5ppp/8/p7/2P5/PP2p2P/2P1K1P1/3R4 b - -',Here I feel I am in a good position to promote a pawn before he can but I somehow blow it. Well somehow like by being a human being with a translated toad's brain in his head.  I end up like him getting impatient maybe. But I just make a series of weak and bad moves now from which I can't recover later. 
680,20,41,g5,b'4r1k1/7p/8/p4pp1/2P5/PP2pK1P/2P3P1/3R4 w - g6',Here I think I should have laid back for a couple moves and started advancing my pawns and dealt with his pawns in a few more moves but I start moving my king around and in the end I lost the advanced squares I needed. 
681,20,42,4Ke2,b'4r1k1/7p/8/p4pp1/2P5/PP2p2P/2P1K1P1/3R4 b - -',See I wind up having to go back to E2 anyway to keep his pawn from advancing. I waste  moves I didn't have. 
682,20,43,4Rd5,b'4r1k1/7p/8/p2R2p1/2P2p2/PP2p2P/2P1K1P1/8 b - -',This is a good move but a little too late I think. 
683,20,44,Kg7,b'4r3/6k1/7p/R5p1/2P2p2/PP2p2P/2P1K1P1/8 w - -',I needed my pawns up a few more squares. I needed to sit back and think earlier. Look at the bigger pictures rather than having gotten blinded by looking at pieces only. I needed to ponder the board and all the places where there were no pieces but territory that needed to be crossed quickly. 
684,20,45,Kh4,b'2r5/8/2P4p/RP4p1/5p1k/P3p2P/2P1K1P1/8 w - -',I am back up 2 points but I obviously have a breechable defense with my weak pawn on G2. I cannot guard with my king and prevent promotion at the same time. 
685,20,46,4Rb7,b'1r6/1R6/2P4p/1P4p1/5p1k/P3p2P/2P1K1P1/8 b - -',My thinking is not bad here but it is again a bit too late. He is a couple moves ahead of me. 
686,20,47,Kxg2,b'2r5/1RP5/1P5p/6p1/5p2/P3p2P/2P1K1k1/8 w - -',There is something wrong here. This move works better with the king on the 8 rank of course. I could move my rook to A7 and then my pawn to B2 guaranteeing a queen but again I do not have time. 
687,20,48,f3+,b'1Rr5/2P5/1P5p/6p1/8/P3pp1P/2P1K1k1/8 w - -',I was hoping of course he would take the rook. But he does not have to. 
688,20,49,5Rxc8,b'2R5/2P5/1P5p/6p1/8/P3K2P/2P2pk1/8 b - -',I still hope for a queen to work with my rook. I fail to see a fatal weakness here and needed to move my king towards someplace like B2. But I am desperate and...
689,20,50,5b7,b'2R5/1PP5/7p/6p1/8/P3K2P/2P3k1/5q2 b - -',Move my B-file pawn up. End of the world move. 
690,20,51,5Qf3+,b'2R5/1PP5/7p/6p1/8/P3Kq1P/2P3k1/8 w - -',I lose my B7 pawn on the next move and resign in frustration. Not a game without lessons however. So that is why it is the first of my THE LOST GAMES SERIES. Believe me many more coming.

I've heard queen pawn games are good when your opponent is better than you because it's less easy to attain a distinct advantage right away."

832,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! This is a game from the Walking the Walk Mini-Tournament Group 4 that I'm annotating on chicoboy's request. Enjoy!
833,27,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White avoids the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5) and chooses the Scotch Game instead. This opening is characterized by the open center and usually White's strong central presence.
834,27,2,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is best. There's no good way for Black to maintain his pawn on e5 and taking with the Knight (3...Nxd4 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4) leaves White's Queen on a very strong central square without an easy way to drive her away.
835,27,3,Qf6,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 are far and away more popular and safer. This is too early to bring out the BQ and furthermore she's blocking the King Knight's best square.
836,27,4,Be3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',A good developing move defending both the Knight and the f2 pawn.
837,27,5,Bc5,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black piles up on the Knight.
838,27,6,c3,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White still has adequate defenses though he's forced to take the c3 square away from his QN.
839,27,7,Nxd4,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/3nP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',? Black has nothing to gain from this exchange. At best he'll give White a formidable center and a developmental edge (7.Bxd4 Bxd4 8.Qxd4 Qxd4 9.cxd4). Better choices would have been 6...d6 or 6...Ne7 to simply continue development.
840,27,8,Bxd4,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/3BP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White recaptures.
841,27,9,Bb6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/1b3q2/8/3BP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',?? Hugely Black overlooks the threat to his Queen.
842,27,10,Bxf6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/1b3B2/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White wastes no time.
843,27,11,Bd3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Black could resign with a mere Bishop for his Queen but chooses to fight on--it's still early in the game and there's plenty of time for White to make mistakes.
844,27,12,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Both players get their Kings to safety.
845,27,13,g6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? I simply don't see a purpose to this move. It needlessly weakens the Black King's position when Black *should* be focusing on getting all his pieces out. When you're behind in material it is absolutely critical to make every move count and make more use of the pieces you *do* have.
846,27,14,1Re1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',White is playing soundly just developing and solidifying his advantage.
847,27,15,1Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',? Again there's no reason for this move. All the King-related movement suggests that Black is feeling how far behind he is and panicking as a result.
848,27,16,1Nf3,b'r1b2r1k/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',White prepares e4-e5.
849,27,17,1Rg8,b'r1b3rk/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I guess this is the point of Black's last move--but what is he going to do with his Rook over here? He should be developing and making active counterplay not this passive repositioning with no apparent purpose. This Rook belongs on e8 anyway to contest White's pawn advance.
850,27,18,Be6,b'r5rk/ppp2p1p/1b2bnp1/4N3/8/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Finally Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces.
851,27,19,1Qf3,b'r5rk/ppp2p1p/1b2bnp1/4N3/8/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White forks the Knight and b7 pawn.
852,27,20,1Kg7,b'r5r1/ppp2pkp/1b2bnp1/4N3/8/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',This is probably the best response Black has to offer. 16...Nd5 would defend b7 momentarily but loses to a tactical shot because weak Black castle is so vulnerable. (e.g. 16...Nd5? 17.Nxf7+ Bxf7 18.Qxf7 c6 19.c4 and now the Black Knight falls since moving would allow 20.Re7 and mate soon to follow.
853,27,21,1Bc4,b'r5r1/ppp2pkp/1b2bnp1/4N3/2B5/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',! White stays the course continuing to hammer at Black's weak King by pointing more pieces at f7.
854,27,22,1h5,b'r5r1/ppp2pk1/1b2bnp1/4N2p/2B5/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - h6',"? It's not clear what Black is planning but it sure isn't ""keeping his King safe"". This lets White force the exchange on e6 and further grow his advantage."
855,27,23,1Qg3,b'r5r1/ppp3k1/1b2pnp1/4N2p/8/2P3Q1/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Threatening a mate in two (20.Qxg6+ Kh8 21.Nf7#). But it's easily defended.
856,27,24,1Kh7,b'r5r1/ppp4k/1b2pnp1/4N2p/8/2P3Q1/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black gets his King out of the way letting the Rook defend the g-pawn. Bear in mind that it only needs defending because of all the weakening moves Black made in the first place!
857,27,25,2Qf3,b'r5r1/ppp4k/1b2pnp1/4N2p/8/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Back to the fork.
858,27,26,2Raf8,b'5rr1/ppp4k/1b2pnp1/4N2p/8/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black defends his Knight and begins to put some indirect pressure on f2.
859,27,27,2Qd3,b'5rr1/ppp4k/1b2pnp1/4N2p/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Now it looks like it's White who can't decide what he wants to do!
860,27,28,2Ng4,b'5rr1/ppp4k/1b2p1p1/4N2p/6n1/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Not great. You should try to avoid piece trades when so far behind since they just give the other player (White) a bigger advantage.
861,27,29,2Ref1,b'5rr1/ppp4k/1b2p1p1/8/6p1/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Defending f2.
862,27,30,2Rg7,b'5r2/ppp3rk/1b2p1p1/8/6p1/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black prepares to double.
863,27,31,2h3,b'5r2/ppp3rk/1b2p1p1/8/6p1/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',This may not be ideal but I like it--White gives his King an escape square and threatens to open the h-file for use against the Black King.
864,27,32,2gxh3,b'5r2/ppp3rk/1b2p1p1/8/8/2PQ3p/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Ooh not good. This loses a pawn to 24.Qxh3+ Kg8 25.Qxe6+. Not to mention it opens the h-file.
865,27,33,Rgf7,b'5rk1/ppp2r2/1b2Q1p1/8/8/2P5/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',The Rooks are doubled now... but pinned.
866,27,34,2Kh1,b'5rk1/ppp2r2/1b2Q1p1/8/8/2P5/PP3PP1/R4R1K b - -',? There was no need for this. Now the WK is on the open file. White ought to have simply picked up another free pawn while maintaining his checks: 27.Qxg6+ Rg7 28.Qe6+
867,27,35,2Kh8,b'5r1k/ppp2r2/1b2Q1p1/8/8/2P5/PP3PP1/R4R1K w - -',Unpinning the Rf7...
868,27,36,2f3,b'5r1k/ppp2r2/1b2Q1p1/8/8/2P2P2/PP4P1/R4R1K b - -',?? White wants to release his Rook from guard duty but it would have been easier to simply give up the pawn. This allows the Bishop to cut off the King's only escape route...
869,27,37,2Rh7+,b'5r1k/ppp4r/1b2Q1p1/8/8/2P2P2/PP4P1/R4R1K w - -',! Black finds his opening. White has only one response.
870,27,38,3gxh3,b'5r1k/ppp5/1b4p1/8/8/2P2P1P/PP6/R4R1K b - -',White still has the advantage but obviously it is much less pronounced.
871,27,39,3Rae1,b'5r2/ppp3k1/1b4p1/8/8/2P2P1P/PP6/4RR1K b - -',This Rook should have been developed fifteen moves ago.
872,27,40,c5,b'7r/pp4k1/1b4p1/2p5/8/2P2P1P/PP4K1/4RR2 w - c6',? Loses a pawn to 33.Re7+. Black should be trying to get his King into the game with ...Kf6-f5.
873,27,41,3c4,b'7r/pp4k1/1b4p1/2p5/2P5/5P1P/PP4K1/4RR2 b - -',White locks up the Bishop instead of grabbing the free pawn.
874,27,42,3Kg3,b'7r/pp2R3/6pk/b1p5/2P5/5PKP/PP6/5R2 b - -',Fine though I would have played 35.Rxb7.
875,27,43,3Kh5,b'7r/pp2R3/6p1/b1p4k/2P5/5PKP/PP6/5R2 w - -',Black is apparently unconcerned about his queenside pawns. To be fair White doesn't seem to care about them either.
876,27,44,3Kg2,b'7r/ppb5/8/5Rpk/2P5/5P1P/PP4K1/5R2 b - -',Better was 39.f4 (Black can't capture it since his g-pawn is pinned).
877,27,45,4Rf2,b'4r3/ppb5/8/5Rpk/2P5/5P1P/PP3RK1/8 b - -',40.f4 was still better. White should be pressuring (and therefore winning) the g-pawn.
878,27,46,4Kh4,b'4r3/ppb5/8/5Rp1/2P4k/5P1P/PP3RK1/8 w - -',?? For some reason Black is intent on putting his King in the most dangerous corner he can find. It looks like he wants to play ...Bg3 to threaten White's Rook... but why? That doesn't actually accomplish anything. Black should be focused on getting his King to an active square not back here where it can't escape from anything. 40...Kg6 was far better.
879,27,47,4Rf7,b'4r3/ppb2R2/8/6p1/2P4k/5P1P/PP3RK1/8 b - -',Threatening mate thanks to the BK's ugly location.
880,27,48,4Bg3,b'4r3/pp3R2/8/6p1/2P4k/5PbP/PP3RK1/8 w - -',?? Black overlooks the mate threat. 41...g4 was called for.
881,27,49,4Rh7#,b'4r3/pp5R/8/6p1/2P4k/5PbP/PP3RK1/8 b - -',Well-spotted by White. This was a game I think about dealing with mistakes. Black gave up his Queen early and seemed to panic as a result making a lot of useless moves and unable to come up with a plan. White gave his Queen up to a nice tactic later but didn't get nearly so flustered and continued to simply look for a victory with his other pieces. It's a good lesson to learn.
882,28,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Icelandic gambit. Inferior but against a well prepared player.

Someday I'll learn to use computer programs to analyze these positions and learn from them rather than simply playing them and not studying them. So before thinking of grabbing the rook black made a quality move that totally gave me pause:
1010,33,11,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/1p1qppb1/1n1p2p1/p2P1b1p/2P4P/1PN2Q2/PB2BPP1/1R3RK1 w - -',This move changed my mind about the rook sacrifice because now black will be able to control e6 too and if the center opens up were I down an exchange the mobility on the board would wipe out any potential positional benefit... and black's king could also be protected better without black being cramped. So without calculating... well heck; I did not calculate ANY  moves this game until the end and even then needed help for it to work; so I played simply for opportunities to control squares and create weaknesses. But this opponent was no slouch and inevitably began about now to do that to me!
1011,33,12,1Rbd1,b'r4rk1/1p1qppb1/1n1p2p1/p2P1b1p/2P4P/1PN2Q2/PB2BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',Anyone who looks at this annotation... where would you have played the rook on b1? e1 may have been better or perhaps even a1; but I did not want my rook on the f file to be completely hemmed in and I was at this point still making plans on the Kingside...
1012,33,13,1Qg3,b'r4rk1/1p1qppb1/1n1p2p1/3P1b1p/p1P4P/1PN3Q1/PB2BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',I decided I'd do the exchange sacrifice anyways and see what came of it.
1013,33,14,2Nxd1,b'r4rk1/1p1qppb1/1n1p2p1/3P3B/2P4P/1P4Q1/1B3PP1/3N1RK1 b - -',Black kept trading a bit more; why not since he's up the exchange...
1014,33,15,Qf5,b'r4rk1/1p2pp2/1n1p2p1/3P1q1B/2P4P/1P4Q1/1N3PP1/5RK1 w - -',Looks very bad for white now. Of course I should avoid trading pieces. One thing of note however is the loss of the exchange is not hurting yet. The black bishop was a great defender and attacker and now it's gone while the black rooks are not yet busy. What to do now...
1015,33,16,Qf6,b'r4rk1/1p2pp2/1n1p1qp1/3P4/2P3BP/1P4Q1/1N3PP1/5RK1 w - -',At this point I pondered moving the Knight to d3 but worried that any thing I did against the black kingside would be way too slow. So I pushed the pawn.
1016,33,17,Qxb2,b'r4rk1/1p2pp2/1n1p2p1/3P3P/2P3B1/1P4Q1/1q3PP1/5RK1 w - -',Bye bye Knight. Black is winning overwhelmingly in material at this point and he's rated nearly 2000. Black's King is under some pressure however. The compensation is not enough for white but at least the game's not boring! Play continued and black really doesn't have time to snatch all the white pawns now which he could have had I moved my knight. For now black's counterplay is not yet fully begun... hah. As if he needs it... or does he?
1017,33,18,2Be6+,b'r4rk1/1p2p3/1n1pB1p1/3P4/2P5/1P4Q1/1q3PP1/5RK1 b - -',Well this I did without thinking. I don't know if there was anything better to be honest. White just doesn't have an attack that can break through easily with black controlling the a1-h8 diagonal. The white rook needs to be part of this and it will take too long... shouldn't it?? To reply to the comment you're right it's not enough because now the pressure on black's king has weakened to the point that it appears white's attack fizzles and black simply can begin munching pawns or working up his own attack. Accurate play by black is simply a won game. That's the problem with Blitz play isn't it. ;)
1018,33,19,Qf6,b'r4r2/1p2p1k1/1n1pBqp1/3P2Q1/2P5/1P6/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',Trading now would be as good as resigning for white.
1019,33,20,Ra6,b'5r2/1p2p1k1/rn1pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q3/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',This is not bad. Yes the rook is at the moment only defending but the Knight will go to a8 and then to c7. And in this position that knight will be very strong because if black succeeds in trading his knight white's attacking chances will evaporate AND that black rook will then move to an immediately useful square. But there is a more interesting move: Ra1! If ...QxN then Rxf1+ Kxf1;  Qa1+  Ke2; Qb2+ and although I did not bother to think about what comes next it looks very bad for white. Just as bad for white is ...Rxa1 Qxa1+ Kh2 Rh8+ Kg3 and Qe5 forces a queen trade after which black wins with a rook and knight vs the bishop. Fortunately for me black missed Ra1+ intent on getting his Knight into the game. If Ra1 white's position is hopeless. But now white can play on a little longer...
1020,33,21,2g3,b'5r2/1p2p1k1/rn1pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5P2/5RK1 b - -',Necessary for any hope of activating the rook and black still doesn't see Ra1. I really should have resigned long ago but I wanted to see what would happen.
1021,33,22,2Na8,b'n4r2/1p2p1k1/r2pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5P2/5RK1 w - -',Here comes the knight. Now in chess it's important to have a plan. In a blitz game we can't always see everything on the board; and so black continued with his plan a good plan. He had many to choose from. At this point I had finally begun to calculate and had foreseen what I hoped would happen and what actually did happen.
1022,33,23,3Rh1,b'5r2/1pn1p1k1/r2pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5PK1/7R b - -',This is another fun position easily avoidable by black but his plan was to activate the knight by golly. Here is where black panicked a little and instead of calmly taking the bishop with the knight he moves Rh8!? Instead after Nxe6 Qe6+ Kf7 dxe6+ Ke8 white has to return to the defensive and again black easily wins.
1023,33,24,3Rh8,b'7r/1pn1p1k1/r2pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5PK1/7R w - -',So I of course knew that the white rook was untouchable and after I took the black rook he quickly realized this and quit in disgust at himself. (Rxh8+ Kxh8 Qh6#) Play might have continued...
1024,33,25,3Rxh8,b'7R/1pn1p1k1/r2pBqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5PK1/8 b - -',At this point he had left the game. But playing a bit futher we find...
1025,33,26,3Nxe6,b'7R/1p2p1k1/r2pnqp1/3P4/2P5/1P2Q1P1/5PK1/8 w - -',Pg5 might actually turn out better for black.  We could have ...Pg5 Rg8+ Kh6 and it looks like black can play on only a pawn down. Qc1 threatening Qh1 of course fails to ...Ra1 still a useful rook move for black. Now if black takes the Bishop things get interesting...
1026,33,27,3dxe6+,b'7R/1p2pk2/r2pPqpQ/8/2P5/1P4P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Here black must take with the King; (Qxe6 Qf8#)
1027,33,28,3Rf8,b'5R2/1p2p3/r2pkqpQ/8/2P5/1P4P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Rf8! And with this move g6 will fall next and depending on where black moves mate follows or black loses too many of his pawns and white wins.
1028,33,29,3Qc3,b'5R2/1p2p3/r2pk1pQ/8/2P5/1Pq3P1/5PK1/8 w - -',Qd4 is better because it puts pressure on f2 and protects the d pawn later on. Not sure if Qb2 was an option to keep pressure on f2 and attack b3. Still think Qd4 looked better. But I put it here where the queen is not doing anything useful for black and did not feel like redoing this annotation to show the better position. It's late and I'm tired. EDIT: And now if I fix the annotation comments at the end would be lost. Qd4 or Qb2 is much better for black and the endgame uncertain. But I'll leave this as it is now so no comments are lost. 
1029,33,30,3Qxg6+,b'5R2/1p2p3/r2pk1Q1/8/2P5/1Pq3P1/5PK1/8 b - -',...Ke5 leads to mate so...
1030,33,31,3Qe8+,b'4QR2/1p1kp3/r2p4/8/2P5/1Pq3P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Now Ke6 leads to mate via Qc8+ Ke5 Qf5+ etc.
1031,33,32,3Kc7,b'4QR2/1pk1p3/r2p4/8/2P5/1Pq3P1/5PK1/8 w - -',And at the least two more black pawns fall and with some care white has a won game. But this was more fun than looking at Pg5 wouldn't you say? ;)  A very fun blitz game. EDIT: Early I spoke about Qd4 for black as being better and perhaps it is. But it looks like black's chances for winning remain slim although a perpetual might be very possible. Anyone gets to this point still would like a comment as to where white's rook should go on move 16.
1032,34,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',The Latvian Gambit is of course my go-to opening in blitz.
1033,34,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Standard is 3...Qf6.

1035,34,3,Qd4,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The GK world database only includes one game with this line but I far prefer it to the alternatives. Black prevents White from freeing himself with d2-d4 at least for now.
1036,34,4,Be6,b'r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Blocking the advance of the pawn and preparing to castle.
1037,34,5,d4,b'r3kbnr/pppq2pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq d3',It could not be avoided forever.
1038,34,6,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/pppq2pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Black has a slight edge in development thanks to White's misplaced Queen.
1039,34,7,1Be3,b'2k1rbnr/pppq2p1/2p1b2p/4Pp2/3P4/2P1B3/PP1NQPPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',This is the only move that doesn't hang the Bishop.
1040,34,8,1g5,b'2k1rbnr/pppq4/2p1b2p/4Ppp1/3P4/2P1B3/PP1NQPPP/R3KB1R w KQ g6',Black is looking for space and a kingside attack.

1042,34,10,1Nf3,b'2k1r1nr/pppqb3/2p1b2p/4Pp2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2Q1PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',White continues to prevent Black's DSB from getting into the game. White is probably a bit better here though his piece placement is less than optimal.
1043,34,11,1Qc2,b'2k1r1nr/ppp1b3/2p1b2p/3qPp2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PPQ3PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Finally letting the LSB out--necessary if White ever wants to castle since his queenside would look pretty weak after trying to shore up a2 against the Black LSB.
1044,34,12,1c5,b'2k1r1nr/ppp1b3/4b2p/2pqPp2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PPQ3PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',In anticipation of Bd3: Black doesn't have many options for defending the f-pawn but if he can open a line for his dark-squared Bishop he could free e7 for his Knight.
1045,34,13,cxd4,b'2k1r1nr/ppp1b3/4b2p/3qPp2/3p1B2/2PB1N2/PPQ3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Blasting a hole in the pawn chain. An interesting continuation (that White doesn't choose) might go 17.Bxf5 dxc3 18.bxc3 (18.Qxc3?? hangs the Bishop) Bc5.
1046,34,14,1cxd4,b'2k1r1nr/ppp1b3/4b2p/3qPp2/3P1B2/3B1N2/PPQ3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Instead White opens the c-file against the BK and avoids isolating his e-pawn.

On the one hand White is anticipating the coming endgame by keeping his King centralized. It also is the least disruptive to White's current plans. On the other hand it's not the endgame *yet* by any means so Black might be able to make some tactical opportunities against the exposed centralized King. In the game I was expecting 18.Bd2.
1048,34,16,1Ne7,b'2k1r2r/ppp1n3/4b2p/3qPp2/1b1P1B2/3B1N2/PPQ2KPP/R6R w - -',This heroic Knight finally leaves his home square after being locked in by pawns all game.

1050,34,18,2Qc4,b'2k1r2r/ppp1n3/1b2b2p/3qPp2/2QP1B2/P2B1N2/1P3KPP/2R4R b - -',White defends his d-pawn and offers a trade--which Black must not take as it would reduce quickly to a winning endgame for White. So Black's next move is forced--there's only one way to avoid the trade without giving away the LSB.
1051,34,19,Bd5,b'2k1r2r/pppq4/1b4np/3bPp2/3P1B2/P1QB1NP1/1P3K1P/2R4R w - -',Black threatens 24...Bxf3 25.Kxf3 Bxd4.

1057,34,25,2Qg2+,b'2k1r2r/ppp5/1b4np/4P3/3P1P2/P1QBB3/1P2K1qP/2R4R w - -',Of course. White's response is equally obvious but what follows is more dangerous than it appears. Of course White can't move his King out of the way as that loses a Rook and pawn for free (28.Ke1 Qxh1+ etc).
1058,34,26,2Bf2,b'2k1r2r/ppp5/1b4np/4P3/3P1P2/P1QB4/1P2KBqP/2R4R b - -',Now the Knight can join the attack: what looks like Black simply winning back a pawn turns out to be much more...
1059,34,27,2Nxf4+,b'2k1r2r/ppp5/1b5p/4P3/3P1n2/P1QB4/1P2KBqP/2R4R w - -',0-1. Here White resigned which is surprising at first glance and truly may be a bit premature but a winning combination does exist if Black can find it. White has four possible moves--but it turns out that none of them help. If 29.Kd2 Black gains the Bishop with 29...Qxf2+. Any move to the back rank (Kd1 or Ke1) drops the Rh1; again with check. So what's wrong with Ke3? I've added a possible continuation for fun. Many thanks for an exciting game barner11!
1060,34,28,Rxe5+,b'2k4r/ppp5/1b5p/4r3/3P1n2/P1QBK3/1P3BqP/2R4R w - -',! Once again taking advantage of the pin on the d-pawn. Additionally this move *looks* like it sacrifices the valiant Knight but in reality the noble steed is as safe as can be: 30.Kxf4?? Qg5+ 31.Kf3 Rf8+ 32.Bf5 Rfxf5#. So retreat is the only option.
1061,34,29,Qxf2+,b'2k4r/ppp5/1b5p/4r3/3P1n2/P1QB4/1P1K1q1P/2R4R w - -',Now Black is a clear Knight to the good and still has the initiative and a strong attack...

Black is a Knight ahead and he'll soon win more material (e.g. 32.Bf5+ Kd8 33.Qd2 Qf3+ 34.Kc2 Re2; all other lines work out about the same). Thanks for reading!

This opponent has a nasty habit of being able to force the draw. Still at one point I'd have happily taken the draw!"
1167,39,1,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Seen this sequence from me before? Of course.....
1168,39,2,h6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p2q1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Two significant pawn moves blocking my development. Perhaps slightly negative from black but thats debatable.
1169,39,3,b3,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/2pb1q1p/4p3/N1B1P3/1P1P1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Bad move. And dumb of me.
1170,39,4,Bxb5,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1pp1/2pb1q1p/1B2p3/N3P3/1P1P1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I really should know better.
1171,39,5,1Qxd5,b'r1b1k2r/p2p1pp1/n2q3p/3Qp3/2P1P3/1P3N2/P4PPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',Optimism says he sees the queen attack and dodges and doesn't look at the rook.
1172,39,6,1Qxd5,b'r1b1k2r/p2p1pp1/n6p/3qp3/2P1P3/1P3N2/P4PPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',Realism says nice try but no cigar.
1173,39,7,2Nh4,b'r1b2r2/p2p1kp1/n4p1p/3Pp3/2P4N/1P6/P4PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',And yet another horrendous move. Instead of capitalising on his mistake I saw the knight under attack and retreated. Obviously KxR gives me material equality.
1174,39,8,2h3,b'r1b2r2/p4kp1/n2p1p1p/3Pp3/2P4N/1P5P/P4PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Another poor move couldn't think of what to do so did that.
1175,39,9,g4,b'r1b2r2/p4k2/n2p1p1p/3Pp3/2P3p1/1P3N1P/P4PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',That is what happens when you push pawns for the sake of not having to think.
1176,39,10,gxh3,b'r1b2r2/p4k2/n2p1p1p/3Pp3/2P5/1P5p/P2N1PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Now if I take it I see the bishop and rook combo breathing down my neck.
1177,39,11,2a3,b'r1b3r1/p4k2/n2p3p/3Ppp2/2P5/PP4Pp/3N1P1K/R2R4 b - -',But I still don't learn. And at this point I'm desperately hoping I can hold on for a draw.
1178,39,12,Nf3+,b'r1b3r1/p4k2/3p4/3P1p1p/1PPNp3/P4nPp/5P1K/2R2R2 w - -',Thats a mistake I think. Swapping material fine but my opponent loses a well placed central pawn and accepts the double. Which probably turns the game.
1179,39,13,3Rfc1,b'r1b5/p4k2/3p4/3P1p1p/1PP3r1/P1R2pPp/5P1K/2R5 b - -',Protecting c4 as he still can't defend f3 so the c3 rook is wandering over there.
1180,39,14,3Kxh3,b'r7/pb6/3p1k2/3P1p1p/1PP3r1/P4RPK/5P2/2R5 b - -',Just clearing up to make sure there aren't any nasty surprises.
1181,39,15,3Rc8,b'2r5/pb6/3p1k2/3P1p1p/1PP3r1/P4RPK/5P2/2R5 w - -',For some reason this move didn't register on me.
1182,39,16,3Re3,b'2r5/pb6/3p1k2/3P1p1p/1PP3r1/P3R1PK/5P2/2R5 b - -',Looking at R-e6
1183,39,17,4Rxd6,b'8/pb3k2/3R4/3P1p1p/1Pr5/P5PK/5P2/8 b - -',Really hoping to get the chance to play R-d7....
1184,39,18,4Rxh5,b'2b5/p4k2/8/3P3R/1Pr5/P5p1/5PK1/8 b - -',Can't rem why I grabbed that one I should have snaffled the g3.
1185,39,19,Rd4+,b'8/2R5/4k3/1P6/PK1r4/8/4b3/8 w - -',Nearly went to a5 but B-d1 response would be a problem.
1186,39,20,6Kb3,b'8/2R5/4k3/1P6/P2r4/1K6/4b3/8 b - -',So I do that instead. Genius huh.
1187,39,21,6Rc2,b'3r4/K7/1P1k4/8/8/8/2R1b3/8 b - -',Attacking the bishop but thats just a feint. The real purpose is to try and force the rook exchange by an exposed.
1188,39,22,7Rd2+,b'8/KP1r4/3k4/8/8/5b2/3R4/8 b - -',Got him. He can't move a piece in the way that rook is mine.
1189,39,23,7Bd5,b'8/KP1r4/3k4/3b4/8/8/3R4/8 w - -',Dammit. I forgot that bishop. That wasn't supposed to happen.
1190,39,24,7Rxd5+,b'8/KP1r4/3k4/3R4/8/8/8/8 b - -',So I got ambitious.
1191,39,25,Rxb7,b'K7/1r6/8/3k4/8/8/8/8 w - -',And rather than take a chance on me weaselling out my opponents kills it.
