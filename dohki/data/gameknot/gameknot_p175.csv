50,1,20,2Kh1,b'r5k1/pp2brpp/3q4/2p4n/2Pp4/6NP/PP3PP1/3RQRNK b - -',Black can win the pawn even with this maneuver; Rd3 is a reasonable response.

53,1,23,2Rf1,b'5r1k/pp4pp/3bQ3/2p5/2Pp4/5NqP/PP4P1/5R1K b - -',White has to be very careful here.  Black wants the knight gone.  Black forestalls because of two squares that the white queen guards: e1 and e8.  Black not preparing for the white initiative around e8:  29...Rxf3? 30.Qe8+! (30...Rf8 31.Rxf8+ Bxf8 32.Qxf8#) 30...Bf8 31.Rxf3 Qxf3 32.gxf3 Kg8 ends badly.  White abandoning the e1 and e8 squares: 30.Qd5 Rxf3 31.Rxf3? Qe1+ 32.Rf1 Qxf1#

Nothing of the Classical Four Pawns' Petrosian Fianchetto Saemisch or Panno variations.  This is a temporarily very closed variation called the East Indian.  Good name as it has a slightly mysterious almost mystical (call it a kind of quantum energy) field!  You won't see any of the conventional center pawn play here.  That means there can arise a very sudden flank attack at any moment for either side.  In this case Black starts it first.
58,2,1,Na4,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/N2P4/P2BPN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',8. Na4.  In this position I have seen no alternatives except for 8. b4 and 8. Ng5.  Na4 has the potential to kick up a lot of harassment by White on the Queen side.  But I was already beginning to think about a flank attack on the other side.
59,2,2,Bg4,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/1B1pp3/N2P2b1/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',9...Bg4.  The two flank attacks are already forming one on the Queen side for White and one on the King side for Black.

I had hoped for this move so I could initiate some serious pressure on White's King's Knight starting with a diversion of my Rook sacrifice.  It is true that I saw no immediate positional or material compensation for the Rook but more of that later.

Probably his best choice here is 10. Nc5.  I would then have to decide if I should deflect my Queen with 10...Qc8.  Then 11. dxe5 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Nxe5 13. Qf4 c6 14. Be2 would happen and the King side action has vanished before it even started.  "

Qd3  Qd7 13. c4 Bxf3 14. gxf3 Ng5 15. e4 Rxe5 and thought there might be a slight advantage to Black.  But nothing as forcing as what happens after 10...Nxe5.

63,2,6,1h3,b'r2qn1k1/ppp2pbp/6p1/3pn3/N5b1/P3PN1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',12. h3.  A fairly serious oversight I think.  This merely precipitates what was coming in any case.  So he probably needed to consider 12. Nc5 Nxf3+ 13. gxf3  Bh3 14. f4 Bxf1  15. Qxf1 b6 16. Nd3 Nd6  17. Qh3 Nc4 with a slight edge to Black.

The immediate threat now is 15...Bg4 16. f3 Qg3+ etc.   I think my choice to recapture the Bishop with my Knight (with 11...Nxe8) was the best choice now as my Queen could not post here on h4 if I had recaptured with the Queen.  A lot of threats are now available to Black to force mate depending upon where the Bishop and Queen end up.  

I did not bother with 14...Bxf1 as the Queen and Bishop are needed to do the job.  "

Qf3 to protect the f2 Pawn after my 16...Ne4 and I then planned 16...Ne4 and either: (i) 17. Nc3 Bg4 18. Qg2 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 skewering one of the two Rooks and hopefully the King's Rook so that ....Bxe1 puts more pressure on the f2 Pawn or (ii) 17. Rb1 Re8 18. Nc3 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 20. Rf1 b6 21.

Can you guess or already know why it is such a popular choice for GM's; and others too? I'll tell a few of the reasons: #1 It ""tests"" the opponent thru all phases of the Game. First is the Opening itself which has reams of theory written on every variation conceivable. The breadth and depth of this theory gives an opponent ample opportunity to err in the very opening and still can produce improvements aor TN's (Theoretical Novelties- Basically a substantially untried move which one hopes is no worse than present theory yet new and different. It might even be slightly inferior but produce such complexity that a well prepared player may feel it is worth playing). The Middle-Game: Here too there is plenty of room for Improvements and novelties and simply knowing or playing the variations better than the opponent. And finally the End Game comes if the opp has not yet succumbed. And it makes for a certain type of endgame as well. It will almost certainly have ""unbalanced pawn structure"" which is considered much less drawish than balanced wings. Also many Rook or Rook + Minor piece endings will occur giving a player of the Sicilian a chance to put extra study and experience in them to good use. "

inoltre poichè l'alfiere che puo' muoversi è quello in f1 e4 è anche un passo di avvicinamento all'arrocco corto.le partite che iniziano con e4 si chiamano in funzione della risposta del nero partite di Gioco Aperto (se il Nero risponde con e5) oppure partite di Gioco Semi-Aperto (se il Nero fa qualsiasi mossa diversa da e5).

Occupare/controllare il centro significa occupare/controllare le quattro case e4d4e5d5; nella battaglia per il centro per capire chi ha la meglio si valutano queste quattro caselle.
Osservando le 4 case centrali si puo' osservare che il pedone bianco minaccia qualsiasi pezzo del Nero che venisse a trovarsi in d5. quindi il Bianco occupa e4 e controlla d5.

essendo il cavallo uno di quei pezzi che ha minor gittata (rispetto all'alfiere e alla torre ad esempio) per esprimere il massimo potenziale (ovvero per minacciare più case possibili cioè 8) è sempre bene che il cavallo sia in una posizione centrale o vicina al centro.diciamo che il cavallo è in una buona posizione quando occupa una delle case comprese nel quadrato formato da c3f3c6f6. 
Inoltre il cavallo è il pezzo più adatto per bloccare l'avanzata di un pedone. Infatti pur avendo davanti a sè il pedone d4 il cavallo grazie al suo movimento ad L è l'unico pezzo che da quella posizione può minacciare le case di possibili difensori del pedone avversario (ovvero c3 e e3).

Oppure guardando attentamente la disposizione dei pezzi del Bianco (la donna bianca punta verso h7 il cavallo bianco da f3 può portarsi in g5 aggiungendo una minaccia ulteriore ad h7) era sicuramente importante prevenire un attacco con h6 (che rende impossibile la discesa del cavallo bianco in g5)."

Instead of attempting to blast the center with a 3 or 4 pawn attack White delays multiple pawn pushes and indirectly controls the center mostly with pieces (knights to c3 & f3 a fianchettoed LSB and later developing the DSB). Pawn to c4 is an exception as it is meant to be played early then later d4 or d3. White usually gains a slight positional advantage.
591,24,1,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Though I don't think this is a particularly bad move it does close off most avenues of escape for the bishop. I will talk more about some options later.

1. Knights are the stronger piece in cramped closed positions while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually but generally pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening become open positions in the middle game and end game. So although both pieces are technically the same value the bishops are my piece of choice.

2. Since the bishop had no place to escape to and no other pieces could defend the bishop you would have to take back with a pawn thus messing up your pawn structure."

That way when I play 10. NxB (and I would) you could respond with 10. ... hg. This would be better for 4 reasons: 1. You would have an open file to my king with a rook already positioned on the file.
2. The doubled pawns would be closer to the edge of the board therefore they are not as important as the center pawns.
3. The move you made prevents you from playing e5 without further damaging your pawn structure. If later you play e5 I will take with my d-pawn and you take back with a piece. That would leave you with 2 ""isolated"" doubled pawns. Isolated doubled pawns are even worse than doubled pawns because they can't protect each other at all. Before the pawn exchange you would have a pawn on f7 e6 and f5. So the f7 pawn protects the e6 pawn which protects the one on f5. 
4. The doubled pawn structure on f7 g7 and g8 would be harder for me to take advantage of."

Option 1: Don't let your bishop get trapped! Before blocking your bishop in with e6 (or d6; or if your playing white e3 or d3) move your rook pawn forward one square to enable the bishop a retreat square. If you are like me you prefer your bishops so this may be best.
Option 2: When the knight attacks the bishop move the bishop back to be defended by the rook-pawn. Then when your opponent takes it you take back with the rook-pawn opening a file to attack with. Then maybe queenside castle.
Option 3: Set up your position so that you have another piece ready and able to capture back. See our current game with you playing white for example. We have almost the same scenario except that you have the option to move your queen knight to e7 defending the bishop.
Option 4: Move the bishop! You had the g4 square available!"

709,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Black has the biggest challenge in this new opening. Its been discussed between Freddy and I if it isn't worth taking the perpetual from blacks point of view. Black has one critical line chance though it doesn't look all that appealing either. Lets start the game on move 6 where the conditional moves run out.
710,29,1,Nxg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Black has accepted the sacrifice and now must go on defense for the slight material gain. The king on b6 will be common place in this tournament.

712,29,3,Kb6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Getting away from the fork Ne6 and allowing white the chance to make an error.
713,29,4,1Ne6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The correct move as far as I'm concerned. Stops the development of the dsb and the h8 rook which will be locked in most of blacks games. 
714,29,5,1d3,b'rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',This is the critical test for black to overcome due to the destructive power of the c1 bishop and the b1 knight as soon will be seen.
715,29,6,1Qg6,b'rn3b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N1q1/8/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? this is the first error crazy how quickly the game slides into whites favor over a move that doesn't look or seem all that bad. The test to see if black can survive will be 11... c5 where white has some options: Na3 Be3 b4 and a4 all look okay my preference though I haven't looked at it too deeply yet would be Na3 then Be3. 11... c5 being the best chance doesn't give much hope to blacks game.
716,29,7,1Na3,b'rn3b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N1q1/8/4pPB1/N2P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',!!

The fact is they lead to the loss of queen or mate. 12... a5 13. Be3+ c5 (Ka6 Nc7#) 14. Nc4+ black now has four choices 1) 14... Kc6 Ne5+ winning the queen. 2) 14... Ka7 15. Bxc5 b6 (Ka7 Nc7#) 16. Bxb6+ Ka6 [Kb7 17. Nd8+ Ka6 18. Bc8+ Kb5 19. a4+ Kb4 20. c3+ Kb3 21. Ra3+ Kc2 22. O-O couldn't find away to avoid mate here] 17. Nc5+ Kb5 18. Kc6 Ne5+ and the game goes to white. 3) Ka6 15. Nxc5+ Kb5 [Ka7 16. Ne6+ Ka6 17. Nc7#] 16. a4+ Kc6 [Kb4 17. c3#] 17. Ne5+ winning the queen if not more here. 4) Kb5 15. a4+ now Three choices A) Kb4 16. c3+ Kb3 17. Nxc5+ Kc2 18. Rc1+ B) Ka6 16. Nxc5+ Ka7 17. Ne6+ b6 [Ka6 Nc7#] 18. Bb6+ Ka6 (Kb7 19. Nd8+ Ka6 20. Bc8#) 19. Nc5+ C) Kc6 16. Ne5+ wins the queen and mates Kd6 Bxc5+ Kd5 c4# (Kb6 Bc5+ Ka6 Nc7# or Kd5 c4+ Kd6 Bc5#). Probably missed a few ideas here and there but as mentioned the best outcome for black is loss of queen.

740,31,0,Qd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/8/3Qp3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',!? Unusual and loses time.
741,31,1,Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/5n2/3Np3/4P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',? White needs to develop.
742,31,2,1Qf5,b'r1bqr1k1/pppnbppp/8/3PpQ2/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',? White needs to prevent the pawn for but this simply aids Black's attack.

750,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I have joined the Annotations Project Part 3 Mini-tournament and I am trying to avoid stepping on the mines playing the black pieces.  Yup black is Q for 2 pieces up but the minor pieces e.g. the knights and bishops are everywhere so it is a minefield for the BK and BQ.  Now my buddy Thom Pham (tofuman) who is a Dentist has bravely joined this tournament.  Although he currently has a Class D rating he has an optimum rating of 1407 so underestimate him at your peril lest he drill a terrific cavity in your rating and give you a massive toothache!  I thought I would annotate this game because he is due to be my opponent and I do not wish to incur my second loss against him so I need to learn something from it to be prepared.   Freddy the Master Mater has used the Caro-Kann Defence to build up to the traditional Queen Sac.  The Caro-Kann is 1. ..... c6 in response to 1. e4 preparing a move like d5.  I will comment further on the action after white's 9th move.   You can follow the game move by move by referring to the Gameknot Analysis version of this game as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14257584&rnd=0.7276568196264748"

753,32,3,1Nxh8,b'rn3b1N/pp2p1pp/1kp5/3q4/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',11. Nxh8 - nacht but see my earlier note.

756,32,6,Rf8,b'5r2/pp3Npp/1kp2n2/2b1pP2/3qp3/2N5/PPPPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',16. ..... Rf8 - black looks OK here he is fully developed and just needs to play a move like Kc7 and then try and take advantage of white's lack of development - he still needs to move out his c1 bishop to prepare castling long.
757,32,7,h6,b'5r2/pp4p1/1kp2n1p/2b1pPN1/3qp3/2N5/PPPPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',17. ...... h6 - instead black decided to chase Thom's knight around.  Aha I see that after Ng5 Kc7 is not possible because of a Royal Fork on e6!
758,32,8,Qxf8,b'5q2/pp4p1/1kp2n1p/2b1pP2/4p3/2N5/PPPPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',19. ....... Qxf8 - Thom is now 4 points up in material.

I feel it is far too early for the king to come out into the middle of the board unless forced to do so do you the jury agree?
760,32,10,Qxc5,b'8/p5p1/2p2n1p/kpq1pP2/4p3/1P6/P1PPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',22. ...... Qxc5 - one set of minor pieces has been exchanged but white still has sufficent material to mate and look at how the Royal black couple are standing - they are sitting ducks for a pawn fork!
761,32,11,Nd5,b'8/p5p1/2p4p/kpqnpP2/4p3/PP6/2PPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',23...... Nd5? - this move is a mistake - please see Gameknot Analysis in my intro note.  I can see even before glancing at Gameknot Analysis that this move is a massive blunder because black is gonna drop his queen to a pawn fork ouch and double ouch!
762,32,12,Kxb4,b'8/p5p1/2p4p/1pq1pP2/1k2p3/8/2PPB1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',25. ...... Kxb4 - It seems as though he has given up his knight to save his queen but now comes a royal skewer from Thom's dark square bishop which finally develops on move 25 to devastating effect ...... for black ....
763,32,13,2Bxc5#,b'8/p5p1/2p4p/kpB1pP2/4p3/8/2PPB1PP/R3KR2 b Q -',27. Bxc5 MATE!! - the Royal couple perish together and The Dentist (Well played there Thom) has his day.

797,34,21,2Qf3,b'2kr4/1ppqbp2/p1n1p3/8/2BP4/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/R1R3K1 b - -',like this beautiful knight
798,34,22,2f6,b'2kr4/1ppqb3/p1n1pp2/8/2BP4/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/R1R3K1 w - -',he may have thought i was pointing the pawn: i didn't event see it
799,34,23,2Bxa6,b'2kr4/1ppqb3/B1n1pp2/8/3P4/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/R1R3K1 b - -',and here is the trap of course. We are now two on the knight and the b7 pawn is pinned
800,34,24,2Rg8,b'2k3r1/1ppqb3/B1n1pp2/8/3P4/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/R1R3K1 w - -',open the fire for his own trap that will never come to end
801,34,25,2Qxc6,b'2k3r1/1ppqb3/B1Q1pp2/8/3P4/4P2P/PP3PP1/R1R3K1 b - -',because we are going to exchange now...
802,34,26,bxa6,b'2k3r1/2p1b3/p1R1pp2/8/3P4/4P2P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - -',all of this for... one more pawn... 
803,34,27,2Rxe6,b'2k3r1/2p1b3/p3Rp2/8/3P4/4P2P/PP3PP1/R5K1 b - -',well lets say two pawns
804,34,28,2Rxa6,b'6r1/2pkb3/R4p2/8/3P4/4P2P/PP3PP1/R5K1 b - -',well no three pawns (though this last one was not in my mind)
805,34,29,2b4,b'8/2pk4/R2b1p2/1r6/1P1P4/P3P2P/5PP1/2R3K1 b - b3',limitating all the possibilities
806,34,30,3f4,b'8/2pk4/R2b4/1r3p2/1P1P1P2/P3P2P/6P1/2R3K1 b - f3',closing doors
807,34,31,3Rb6,b'8/2pk4/Rr1b4/5p2/1P1P1P2/P3P2P/6P1/2R3K1 w - -',?? things get worse and worse for black by simplifying...
808,34,32,3hxg4,b'8/3k4/1p1b4/8/1P1P1PP1/P3P3/8/2R3K1 b - -',it is now clear that nothing can stop all this stuff...
809,34,33,3Ke6,b'8/8/1p1bk3/8/1P1P1PP1/P3P3/8/2R3K1 w - -',but bluemarble just likes to fight. 
810,34,34,3Rc6,b'8/8/1pRbk3/8/1P1P1PP1/P3P3/8/6K1 b - -',one last pawn away
811,34,35,3Kf2,b'8/2b5/R7/8/1P1PkPP1/P3P3/5K2/8 b - -',may be my only mistake here: i could have played Re6+ to make it quicker

813,34,37,4d7,b'8/3P4/R7/5k2/1P6/P7/5K2/8 b - -',i said thank you :-)
814,34,38,Kg5,b'8/4Q3/5R2/6k1/1P6/P7/5K2/8 w - -',was he thinking about a mistake to get a draw?

816,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hello everyone and today I will annotate a very instructive game I picked out played on GK between a C and B level player. This game shows white blundering in the opening but holding up to the endgame. When the result is likely a draw white slips and loses.

So first: e4."
817,35,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',the open games. Development will matter more here.
818,35,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',going into the four knights game which is not the most promising opening for whitebut perfectly playable.
819,35,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Perfectly OK move although I would not like this because black can equalize immediately with the center fork trick: 4...Nxe4! with a good game. If white tries 5.Bxf7ch?! which I remember playing 2 years ago then 5...Kxf7  6.Nxe4 d5!  7.Ng5ch Kg8  and black had small advantage in Me(1100) vs. opponent in 2008. Black converted his advantage well and almost won but only drew.
820,35,4,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I prefer Nxe4
821,35,5,Ne2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"the mistake. This move:

1.Loses a central pawn
2.Moves a piece twice (to a worse square too)

This was probably intended to force through d4 but with terrible ""side effects"""
822,35,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',black leaves the pawn. Fine I guess as white is down in development now. I think his best choice is d3 with a slightly worse game.
823,35,7,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ d3',this loses a pawn now.
824,35,8,Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2BNn3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',now black pockets the pawn with a better position. This is an important moment in the game. Now that white is down a pawn he will go for the draw. White's material advantage is not big enough to stop playing tactically and making threats immediately. He will try to expand his advantage if possible. Black will want to be playing much more tactically and fogging the position.
825,35,9,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/2bp4/2BNn3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - d6',Yes! A key move for black when a bishop is on c4(2 knights def guicco piano scotch gambit more..). This is now getting a full tempo.
826,35,10,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/2bp4/3Nn3/1B6/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',black strengthens the pawns.
827,35,11,1h3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/2bp4/3Nn3/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',white wants to prevent Bg4?(f2-f3) maybe...  I don't know it is a waste of time to me and creates a target on h3.
828,35,12,1c3,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p2q2/2bp4/3Nn3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',protecting the knight but white should get his pieces out faster.
829,35,13,1Qg6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p3q1/2bp4/3Nn3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',threatening the target on h3.
830,35,14,Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p2q2/2bp4/3Nn3/1BP2Q1P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',I really don't think this is very good. Black should expand the advantage. He should not be so confident in being able to convert a single pawn in to a win. 
831,35,15,1Bg5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/2bp2B1/3N4/1BP4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',threatening to double the pawns and while I would never care about doubled pawns in the middlegame in the endgame they may be weak.
832,35,16,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/2bp2B1/3Nn3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',attacking the bishop and getting out of the threat.
833,35,17,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/2bp4/3Nn3/1BP1B2P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',just getting the rest of the pieces out. I doubt that black can win this.
834,35,18,Bxd4,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/3bn3/2P1B2P/PPB2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',this just gives away the bishop pair!
835,35,19,1Bxd4,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/3Bn3/2P4P/PPB2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',white already may have ideas like Bxe4 and of followed by a few exchanges on the e file he may have an easy draw.
836,35,20,1Rfe1,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p1b2/3Bn3/2P4P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',not much to say about these moves
837,35,21,1Bd7,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/3p4/3Bn3/2P4P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Wonder why he'd do this? Anyone know? tell me
838,35,22,2c4,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/3p4/2PBn3/7P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',threatening to isolate the d pawn. In a middlegame this would give black chances for initiative but here even though the pawn is passed it is weak.
839,35,23,2Nd6,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2pn4/3p4/2PB4/7P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',white can now isolate the pawns.
840,35,24,2c5,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2pn4/2Pp4/3B4/7P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',takes the pressure off!
841,35,25,2Nf5,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/2Pp1n2/3B4/7P/PPB2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',white can now play Bxf5 followed by exchanging the rooks and he can get a draw.
842,35,26,Rxe8,b'4r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/2Pp1n2/3B4/7P/PPB2PP1/R5K1 w - -',not so great as Bxf5 allows black entrance to the 2nd rank(work this out) where it is very strong.
843,35,27,2b4,b'4r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/2Pp1n2/1P1B4/7P/P1B2PP1/R5K1 b - b3',blunder. After defending so well black falters and loses his bishop... 
844,35,28,2Nxd4,b'4r1k1/pp1b1ppp/2p5/2Pp4/1P1n4/7P/P1B2PP1/R5K1 w - -', the rest id easy.

846,36,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',a better planing can make you win...
847,36,1,4Rxg6+,b'3r4/6k1/6R1/4P3/4BP2/4n1B1/1r5P/6K1 b - -',no pawn....... :-(
848,36,2,4Kf8,b'3r1k2/8/6R1/4P3/4BP2/4n1B1/1r5P/6K1 w - -',now need a good planning
849,36,3,4Rd8+,b'2rR1k2/8/8/4P3/4BP1B/4n3/1r5P/6K1 b - -',THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END........

851,36,5,7Rd1#,b'8/8/8/8/8/6k1/8/3r2K1 w - -',FINALLY....... WIN
852,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',quite enjoyed this game plus it's my first win against a 1700+ ranked player. I like annotating games on here because of the comments and remarks really helps me understand the game more. 
853,37,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',sorry quite bad with openings what is white's opening called?
854,37,2,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BPP1b1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',not a good move maybe Nc6 is better
855,37,3,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3pbn2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',moving same piece twice

857,37,5,Bg5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2nppn2/4p1B1/Q2PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',white's on the attack
858,37,6,Bxf6,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/2nppB2/4p3/Q2PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',do you think capturing with pawn gxf6 for the exchange is better?
859,37,7,1d5,b'r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2nppb2/3Pp3/Q3P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',nice defence chain from white and a weak one this side. normally i'd be thinking to check! but no point im losing that knight either way.
860,37,8,Kf8,b'r2q1k1r/ppp3pp/2np1b2/3Pp3/Q7/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN2K1NR w KQ -',this was a mistake! I wanted to go for the castling o-o! still doesn't mean it was the best move. maybe Qd7
861,37,9,Rb8,b'1r1q1k1r/p1p3pp/2Qp1b2/4p3/8/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN2K1NR w KQ -',thinking the queen won't be able to do anything on it's own in attack! got my eyes on the b2 pawn not a big deal but i wanted to show some pieces!
862,37,10,1Ne2,b'1r1q1k1r/p1p3pp/2Qp1b2/4p3/8/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/RN2K2R b KQ -',white's trying to develop his pieces.
863,37,11,1Rxb2,b'3q1k1r/p1p3pp/2Qp1b2/4p3/8/2P2P2/Pr2N1PP/RN2K2R w KQ -',moving forward i think this move also denied white to castle. 
864,37,12,1Ng3,b'3q1k1r/p1p3pp/2Qp1b2/4p3/8/2P2PN1/Pr4PP/RN2K2R b KQ -',e5 pawn controlling the middle

866,37,14,1Ne4,b'3q1k1r/p1p3pp/2Qp1b2/4p3/4N3/2P2P2/P5rP/RN2K2R b KQ -',still I don't see real threat!

868,37,16,1Nxf6,b'3q3r/p1p2kpp/2Qp1N2/4p3/8/2P2P2/P5rP/RN2K2R b KQ -',obviously exchange is in white's favour.
869,37,17,1gxf6,b'3q3r/p1p2k1p/2Qp1p2/4p3/8/2P2P2/P5rP/RN2K2R w KQ -',I didn't want to move my queen because it's securing the good chain also this opens g file for my rooks to dominate.
870,37,18,1f4,b'3q3r/p1p2k1p/2Qp1p2/4p3/5P2/2P5/P5rP/RN2K2R b KQ -',trying to expose my rook on g2 made me glad the earlier move opened g file for my other rook to cover.

875,37,23,Rg2g5,b'3q1kr1/p1p4p/3p1p2/3Q2r1/5p2/2P5/P2N3P/2KR3R w - -',attacking his queen stops white developing for a minute.
876,37,24,c5,b'3q1kr1/p6p/3p1p2/2p3r1/3Q1p2/2P5/P2N3P/2KR3R w - c6',still attacking the queen

878,37,26,2Rg5g2,b'3q1kr1/p6p/3p1p2/2p5/5p2/2P5/P2N1QrP/2KR3R w - -',I don't think this was very wise
879,37,27,2Qxf4,b'3q1kr1/p6p/3p1p2/2p5/5Q2/2P5/P2N2rP/2KR3R b - -',-1 with unnecessary move! things are looking better for white with e file being empty maybe rook Rf1 covering queen and Ne4.  
880,37,28,2Rg8g7,b'3q1k2/p5rp/3p1p2/2p5/5Q2/2P5/P2N2rP/2KR3R w - -',just didn't want queen to check on h6
881,37,29,2Ne4,b'3q1k2/p5rp/3p1p2/2p5/4NQ2/2P5/P5rP/2KR3R b - -',pawn on d6 was very weak and could lead to mate in no time
882,37,30,2Qe7,b'5k2/p3q1rp/3p1p2/2p5/4NQ2/2P5/P5rP/2KR3R w - -',moving out of Rxd6 and maybe going into queen exchange.
883,37,31,2Qxf6+,b'5k2/p3q1rp/3p1Q2/2p5/4N3/2P5/P5rP/2KR3R b - -',took me some time to think about this but though if i could get rook into e7 after queen exchange i have a chance of an attack with the two rooks 
884,37,32,2Qh8+,b'5k1Q/p3qr1p/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P5rP/2KR3R b - -',this move made me panic I thought mate was on the my door step. one of the reasons is that I only had one move available! turns out that was a blunder!
885,37,33,2Rg8,b'5krQ/p3qr1p/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P6P/2KR3R w - -',no way out for queen. 
886,37,34,2Qxg8+,b'5kQ1/p3qr1p/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P6P/2KR3R b - -',please let me know if you think there's a better move maybe Rf1.
887,37,35,2Kxg8,b'6k1/p3qr1p/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P6P/2KR3R w - -',now on +2.
888,37,36,Rg7,b'6k1/p3q1rp/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P6P/2KR2R1 w - -',still have my eyes on the knight thinking white won't give away this exchange. 
889,37,37,Qxg7,b'6k1/p5qp/3p4/2p5/4N3/2P5/P6P/2KR4 w - -',now thinking it'll be interesting to see how Rook and knight work together.
890,37,38,Qg5+,b'6k1/p6p/3N4/2p3q1/8/2P5/P6P/2KR4 w - -',the knight is covered with the rook so no need to pin on Qh6.
891,37,39,Qg6+,b'6k1/p6p/3N2q1/2p5/8/2P5/P1K4P/3R4 w - -',just few moves to get some time to think
892,37,40,Qxa2+,b'6k1/p6p/3N4/2p5/8/2P5/q1K4P/3R4 w - -',back to +2
893,37,41,3Kc1,b'6k1/p6p/3N4/2p5/8/2P5/q6P/2KR4 b - -',didn't know how to break them.

914,37,62,Qb3#,b'8/8/8/1k6/2p5/KqP5/N7/2R5 w - -',very epic game. one last thing the game finished with 2:48 minutes for black vs. 9:48 for white.  
915,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hello everyone and now I will annotate a game played recently between 2 C level players on GK.

So white plays e4."
916,38,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',black plays c5 the Sicilian defense. This is the most popular reply to e4 and the most theoretical. There are hundreds of important lines in the open sicilian(Nf3) and only a player who has a very good memory and lots of study time will be able to learn the open sicilian.
917,38,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3. White goes for an open sicilian.
918,38,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',the d6 variations. This can usually go into a najdorf or dragon after d4.
919,38,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',instead white chooses Bc4 a perfectly reasonable choice. The bishop is active and white can bring out his other pieces easily. 
920,38,5,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/3p3p/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I'll give this a ?! for a dubious move. Black needs to get on with his development. I suggest Nc6. Instead h6 deprives the dark squared bishop of the square g5 when it has an equally good square at f4.
921,38,6,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/3p3p/2p5/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This does have a purpose denying the black light bishop g4 and when white's dark bishop goes to f4 it can get tucked in at h2. This does not develop however but I will not give it?!.
922,38,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2ppp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A perfectly good choice.

924,38,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2np1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now both players are developing their pieces.
925,38,10,Bd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2np1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',A dubious and passive move. The bishop is much more effective at f4. Maybe white didn't like e5but that weakens d5 severely. Even if white doesn't know what to do with this bishop he could move the knight with Nc3.
926,38,11,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq e6',I don't like this move at all. It clamps on d4 but that square isn't an outpost. It severely weakens d5 and a piece may find a permanent home there later in the game.
927,38,12,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',A waste of time. Better is 0-0 or Nc3.
928,38,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',An OK move here.
929,38,14,Bxh3,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1b/1PPB1PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',A big mistake. Less experienced players consider to be good since taking the bishop ruins the kingside structure and exposes the king. However these moves are only good if black has adequate forces to attack the king after it's pawn structure is shattered.
930,38,15,gxh3,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1P2/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',And here with the sacrifice of a bishop black has blasted open the g file. But whose g file is it? It's white's g file which means he can play Kh2 followed by Rg1 when the sacrifice only helped white's rook and the king is hard to attack. At this moment white is up a bishop and black has not nearly enough compensation.
931,38,16,g5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2np1n1p/2p1p1p1/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1P2/RN1Q1RK1 w kq g6',the idea of this is right open lines to attack. Black may include the h8 rook into the fight but again if white defends well then he will get a big advantage. 
932,38,17,Nd4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p1n1p/2p1p1p1/2BnP3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',taking the post and remaining a piece down.
933,38,18,cxd4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p1n1p/4p1p1/2BpP3/P1NP3P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',here we see the doubled d pawns but these are actually good for black as they can't be attacked easily the d4 pawn gets space and the c file is open.
934,38,19,1Nd5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p1n1p/3Np1p1/2BpP3/P2P3P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',now the weakness of the d5 square is apparent.
935,38,20,1Bxd5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p3p/3Bp1p1/3pP3/P2P3P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',the bishop is well placed here. It cannot be driven away.
936,38,21,Qb5,b'r3k2r/pp2bp2/3p3p/1q1Bp1p1/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',"At this point black can ask himself: What do I get for the bishop? almost nothing. The ""attack"" he imagined has not come simply because there are no pieces to participate in it."
937,38,22,1Qh5,b'r3k2r/pp2bp2/3p3p/1q1Bp1pQ/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R4RK1 b kq -',the queen is advanced and very active here.
938,38,23,1Kh1,b'r3k3/pp2bp1r/3p3p/1q1Bp1pQ/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R4R1K b q -',yes. he can now prepare Rg1 and h4 sometime.
939,38,24,1Qd7,b'r3k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/3Bp1pQ/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R4R1K w q -',just moving around. Black's pieces really have nothing to do.
940,38,25,1c4,b'r3k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/3Bp1pQ/1PPpP3/P2P3P/3B1P2/R4R1K b q c3',Fine move! White increases his space on the Q-side.
941,38,26,1Rb8,b'1r2k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/3Bp1pQ/1PPpP3/P2P3P/3B1P2/R4R1K w - -',If black wants b4 he will have to get the b pawn out of the pin.

White who has an easy win probably asked himself: Why did my opponent make this move? instead of: What are all the things black intends to do with this move? white probably thought black wants to repeat the position or is just getting out of the queen trade. But he missed a minor detail. Before I would score the position 4 because of white's material and positional advantage(bishop pair more active pieces more space). Now it is Mate(1)
