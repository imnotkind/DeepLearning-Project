0,0,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',As usual it started off with the Spanish Opening.  But I was interested in seeing how he would respond since Jack plays different moves.
1,0,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Like our last training session he played this.
2,0,2,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"So as I have also emphasized the importance to a student I castled.  He said ""Aha very smart"" and I smiled."
3,0,3,Nd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb1p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I was a little anxious but using Jack's advise of not getting nervous which I've stressed to two of my students I took a while to think.  I asked myself if there was an alternative and considered 5.Nxe5.  But after 5...Qe7 not only would he Jack get a pawn back but I'd wind up losing tempo.  Aside from that anything else looked nasty.
4,0,4,Nxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb1p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"So I decided to take this way.  He said ""Sure you have to.  Otherwise you lose your bishop.  Right?  I said right.  Of course I realize that by looking at it on this website that really isn't so but I thought it was by the looks of 5...c6 or 5...a6 which I was determined to prevent for now."
5,0,5,Nc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Figuring out what to do after his last move I decided to play this.  The idea being that not only do I continue to develop but I am not concerned if he doubled up my pawns with 6...Bxc3  The idea being is that we haven't exchanged major pieces.  I know that it depends on the position.  But when I'm not sure in a particular position then I go by what tactical-abyss told me as it makes sense to me..  In it Joe has said that doubled pawns are usually of no real asset until major pieces have been exchanged.  
6,0,6,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Not only continuing with his development and preparing to castle but he is threatening e4.  And I must be on the lookout as otherwise he will that pawn after 7...Bxc3 and when 8.PXB he has 8...Nxe4 which I was not going to allow.
7,0,7,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',So I protect it.
8,0,8,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p4n2/1B2p3/3bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Now he goes on the attack against my LSB.
9,0,9,Ba4,b'r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p4n2/4p3/B2bP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I also considered 8.Bc4 but the problem is that it allows 8...b5 and now I have to block my d3 or e2 files which is the center (lest I undevelop my LSB) or I am forced to play 9.Bb3 which just loses time any how.  So to save that I decide to retreat on the most common square.
10,0,10,d6,b'r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/3bP3/1BN5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Opening up a line for his Bc8.
11,0,11,1a4,b'r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/P2bP3/1BN5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq a3',Thinking about what to do I play this.  Now I had considered 10.d3 to open up lines for my Bc1 but I was determined to prevent 10...b4 which would force me to place my Nc3 on an uncomfortable.  What I mean by uncomfortable is that you must place it on the homesquare.  Come to think of is could've been allowed as there is a better placement since Ng3 would become an option later on.  But what really went through my mind in calculating variations was something like 10...b4 11.Ne2 a5 (as now it would not be possible for me to take on b5) and that would be followed by ...a4 losing a piece for a pawn.  Plus I thought it would allow Jack to get an open file which is the last thing that I wanted.  It's especially because in one of TA's Q sacs (not on the weakest square) the opponent lost by allowing Joe to get an open file.  Therefore it is example of how I learned from that game and applied for this one.
12,0,12,1Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/P2bP3/1BN5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Placing his B on a flank.  But I've got a surprise for Jack.
13,0,13,1axb5,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/p2p1n2/1P2p3/3bP3/1BN5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',"And he said ""It's a good move.""  One of the reasons I did was to exchange pieces and eliminate Jack's Ra8 before he can get an open file."
14,0,14,1Bg5,b'b2qk2r/2p2ppp/3p1n2/1p2p1B1/4P3/1BP5/1PP2PPP/3QR1K1 b k -',Therefore I decide to go right for it and pin his N.  That's is another reason for playing 12.dxc3 as opposed to 12.bxc3  Now I'm confident that the center is contested which was also the goal.
15,0,15,1h6,b'b2qk2r/2p2pp1/3p1n1p/1p2p1B1/4P3/1BP5/1PP2PPP/3QR1K1 w k -',When you can use the B on the same square Jack will often respond with something like this.  The idea being is that he doesn't like being pinned.  I can't blame especially after the blunder I made in his pinning motiv which allowed him to win quickly.
16,0,16,1Bh4,b'b2qk2r/2p2pp1/3p1n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BP5/1PP2PPP/3QR1K1 b k -',? I was thinking about what to do.  15.Bxf6 strongly came into consideration but the reason I didn't capture was to prevent 15...Qxf6 which appears to leave Jack better placed since his Q would be more mobile.  However this is a mistake which will give him an advantage for once I retreat he will a pawn.  I overlooked it due to playing 7.Re1  But with his B on a8 my extra defender was gone as he now has an additional attacker.  Therefore best was to take his Nf6.
17,0,17,1Qf3,b'b2qk2r/2p2p2/3p3p/1p2p1p1/4n3/1BP2QB1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b k -',"Trying to recompensate for lost material I played this.  I'm not trying to mate but that's the threat.  Believe it or not Jack told me that this was a blunder and asked me what happened if he plays 17...Nd2 forking my LSB+Q.  I told him that I would deliver mate with 18.Qxf2#  In fact that's what was initially played but since this is a training game unlike with an OTB tourney but similar to what we see (before hitting submit) there are take backs.  Mr. Stockel told me why he made that mistake and it is due to his glacoma.  He confused my LSB for a N.  In other words he thought that a N was on b3 as opposed to my Bishop.  Having corrected the mistake he accurately said that 17...Nf6 is the only option.  After moving there he said ""My piece is protected"" and I nodded.  In fact I realize that there's more to this then meets the eye.  For once he retreats to f6 my Q will be attacked which will force to get it out of harms way."
18,0,18,Qe7,b'b3k2r/2p1qp2/3p1n1p/1p2p1p1/8/1BP1Q1B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w k -',"Jack: I can give you a pawn for a piece.  After seeing how it happens when I take I said yes but if I take your pawn I lose a pawn.  He said ""right""."
19,0,19,1Qa7,b'b3k2r/Q1p1qp2/3p1n1p/1p2p1p1/8/1BP3B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b k -',Trying to get something.
20,0,20,1Kd7,b'b6r/Q1pkqp2/3p1n1p/1p2p1p1/8/1BP3B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Joe: Wow I overlooked that.  Jack: With my pawn on d6 my piece is protected.
21,0,21,2Qa5,b'b6r/2pkqp2/3p1n1p/Qp2p1p1/8/1BP3B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',So if I can't get his LSB I'll at least try to win back a pawn.  But Jack prevents this with his next move.  
22,0,22,2Qb4,b'7r/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/1p2p1p1/1Q6/1BP3B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Before moving here we discussed it.  The reason being is that I was planning to play 21.c4 but after seeing what happened in my game against bhidragon (which I showed Jack before this game) I decided to discuss this first.  Joe: If my Queen weren't out of play I'd play 21.c4  Jack: The only problem is 20...Ra8  In it he implied that I'd lose tempo since my Q would be forced to run back.  Well as we know tempo in general is vital.
23,0,23,2Ra8,b'r7/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/1p2p1p1/1Q6/1BP3B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Jack: Very dangerous now.  Joe: For white or black?  Jack: For black.  Maybe I'll play here.
24,0,24,2c4,b'r7/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/1p2p1p1/1QP5/1B4B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Knowing that I don't have to worry about tempo loss and the fact that my Q isn't out of play this is where I go for the gusto.  He figured that this is where I'd sac a piece for a pawn for something else which is not as good.  Jack: I thought you'd play 22.Bxe5 and I'd respond with 22...Qxe5.  And if you take with 23.Rxe5 I have 23...Ra1#  So this is your best move.  I agreed as we played through these variations together (which we typically do as Homework that he gives me) and it's the same idea as when I play through them here with analyze the board.  So I nodded but there was one thing we both overlooked which is the same thing to what happened to me in a couple of annotations.  The fact is that 23...Ra1+ isn't mate right away.  After he would play that I'd only have one move which is 24.Re1 but then 24...Rxe1#  Therefore the point is that he would sac his Queen for a mate which you see sometimes.  
25,0,25,2Qxc4,b'r7/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/4p1p1/2Q5/1B4B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',"I also considered 23.Bxc4 but saw an issue with that as it would cost me a piece.  So I said to prevent ...Ra4 I decided to take with the Queen.  And he responded by saying ""You could.  No question about that."""
26,0,26,2Rf8,b'5r2/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/4p1p1/2Q5/1B4B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',This time however I have no idea why Jack played this.  
27,0,27,2Ba4,b'5r2/2pkqp2/2bp1n1p/4p1p1/B1Q5/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',In the meantime I was concerned about 24...Bd5  For if he played that I'd lose tempo.  So I decided to prevent that by responding with this move as now his B is directly pinned.
28,0,28,2Bxa4,b'5r2/2pkqp2/3p1n1p/4p1p1/b1Q5/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Jack: I'll get rid of your Bishop.  However this did not bother me as I figured that he would play this.
29,0,29,2Qxa4+,b'5r2/2pkqp2/3p1n1p/4p1p1/Q7/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',So my response was obviously going to be recapturing.  Therefore although not on GK or with the features 24...Bxa4 was a conditional move because it was preorganized.  So under the condition that he took I'd take back.  However I forgot to do something important.  While there's no rule about it on this website in an OTB tourney when you place your opponent in check you must announce.  If you fail to do this and he or she did not realize that they were in check you're not allowed to capture the K.  So there's no checkmate.  Jack: You said check right?  Joe: Forgot that it was as I mixed the colors up.  The only problem (why I find fault with myself) is the fact that I have been doing that quite a bit.  What really upsets me is that I was on one or two occasions giving one of my students the wrong information by reversing the colors like this.  Therefore I'm trying to turn that from a weakness into a strength but the problem is still around.
30,0,30,2c6,b'5r2/3kqp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/Q7/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I thought Jack would respond with 25...Ke6 but this is how he gets out of check.
31,0,31,2Qa7+,b'5r2/Q2kqp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',But this time I announced check.  Jack: I figured you'd do that.
32,0,32,2Ke6,b'5r2/Q3qp2/2ppkn1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Joe: And I figured that you'd do this.  Jack: I don't know if I can get out of trouble.
33,0,33,2Qxe7+,b'5r2/4Qp2/2ppkn1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',"Not knowing what to do I decided to check and exchange Q's.  Believe it or not the only other move that came into consideration (after looking at a couple of choices) was 27.Qa6  But the only reason I would play it would be in hopes of winning his c6.  However I knew that my coach would not allow that and would thus be an unsound plan.  That's because he'd respond with 27...c6 and as we know based on what my coach stated and a mentor implied ""Start thinking.""  In other words don't assume anything which is something I stress to my students as well.  However I knew how dangerous his Q was based on how Mr. Stockel used it earlier.  So I decided to get rid of this at once."
34,0,34,2Kxe7,b'5r2/4kp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Forced.
35,0,35,2Rd1,b'5r2/4kp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Jack: You put your Rook there?  I nodded.
36,0,36,2Ra8,b'r7/4kp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Jack: I'll put my Rook here.  Joe: Ok let's see what happens.  Jack: Yeah let's see it's interesting.  Very interesting.  And I knew he'd say that it was interesting because that he frequently does so I nodd.
37,0,37,2Rb1,b'r7/4kp2/2pp1n1p/4p1p1/8/6B1/1PP2PPP/1R4K1 b - -',I anticipated 29...Ra2 as this would threaten to win my b2 pawn.  Knowing this I also considered 29.b3 but he can still bring his Ra8-a2 and threaten c2.  So to prevent that mess I decided to move here.
38,0,38,2Ne4,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/4n3/6B1/1PP2PPP/1R4K1 w - -',At first I viewed this move as pointless.  But then I figured out that he could double my pawns which I'm now trying to prevent as major pieces have been exchanged.  However I saw a bigger danger which was ...h5 followed by ...h4 and if Jack could get his h6-h4 I'd lose a piece for pawn since my DSB would be locked in.
39,0,39,3f3,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/4n3/5PB1/1PP3PP/1R4K1 b - -',To prevent that I decided to move here.  The idea being is that if Jack is to advance his h pawn I could get out with my DSB. 
40,0,40,3Nd2,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/5PB1/1PPn2PP/1R4K1 w - -',Not only protecting his N but threatening my R in the process.
41,0,41,3Rd1,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/5PB1/1PPn2PP/3R2K1 b - -',So I reattack by hitting his N.
42,0,42,3Nc4,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/2n5/5PB1/1PP3PP/3R2K1 w - -',And Jack goes after my b2 pawn.
43,0,43,3Rb1,b'r7/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/2n5/5PB1/1PP3PP/1R4K1 b - -',Which I protect.
44,0,44,3Ra2,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/2n5/5PB1/rPP3PP/1R4K1 w - -',But what I overlooked was this move.  When he first played this I wasn't afraid because I thought that if 32...Rxb2 33.Rxb2 winning the R for a pawn.  But with his Nc4 Jack would answer with 33...Nxb2 winning a pawn and liquidating.  For that reason slightly better was 32.b3 and if 32...Nd2 33.Rb1 so I'd get as opposed to losing time.
45,0,45,3b3,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/2n5/1P3PB1/r1P3PP/1R4K1 b - -',But now I do hit his N.  Though as noted I think it would've been better a move earlier.
46,0,46,3Nd2,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/1P3PB1/r1Pn2PP/1R4K1 w - -',And Jack reattacks.
47,0,47,3Be1,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/1P3P2/r1Pn2PP/1R2B1K1 b - -',?? But I overlooked that my c2 pawn and R are attacked.  With that Jack can and should win my R.  Best was 34.Rc1 protecting both.
48,0,48,3Rxc2,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/1P3P2/2rn2PP/1R2B1K1 w - -',Luckily Jack overlooks it and takes my pawn instead.  Though I'm not happy with that blunder.  It means however that we both overlooked my Rb1 being attacked.  With my coach however it's excusable (I excuse it do to his glacoma.)  But I don't excuse my blunder because in this case I moved too quickly and therefore did not take enough time to think before playing 34.Be1
49,0,49,3Bxd2,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/1P3P2/2rB2PP/1R4K1 b - -',Coincidentally I took his N as this was part of my plan anyhow.  But now I'm glad he did otherwise Jack would've taken my R.
50,0,50,3Rxd2,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/8/1P3P2/3r2PP/1R4K1 w - -',For the obvious reason he recaptures.
51,0,51,3b4,b'8/4kp2/2pp3p/4p1p1/1P6/5P2/3r2PP/1R4K1 b - -',Although it's not a passed pawn I'm treating as though it were and I remember that passed pawn must be pushed.  The point is that I'm treating b4 like a dangerous pawn since the plan is to promote if black does slip up.  But I know that with my coach chances are very slim that this would occur.  However since I'm at a disadvantage and am going for counterplay I might as well play Hope Chess because the idea is hoping for a mistake that will allow you to get an advantage.  And as we know this once happened in a lost position after being a R and two pawns down where he made a mistake and allowed me to mate in two.
52,0,52,3d5,b'8/4kp2/2p4p/3pp1p1/1P6/5P2/3r2PP/1R4K1 w - -',But Jack sees my intention and stops it.
53,0,53,3Rc1,b'8/4kp2/2p4p/3pp1p1/1P6/5P2/3r2PP/2R3K1 b - -',With that being said I figured that Jack made a mistake.  So with his last move 36...d5 I thought that I was going to win back a pawn.
54,0,54,3Kd6,b'8/5p2/2pk3p/3pp1p1/1P6/5P2/3r2PP/2R3K1 w - -',But he found the only move to prevent this up to my surprise.
55,0,55,3Rc5,b'8/5p2/2pk3p/2Rpp1p1/1P6/5P2/3r2PP/6K1 b - -',?? So I decided to put pressure on his pawn chain with one being a passed pawn.  The idea was to stop.  But Jack pointed out that this loses immediately because of...
56,0,56,3Rb2,b'8/5p2/2pk3p/2Rpp1p1/1P6/5P2/1r4PP/6K1 w - -',"This move and with it Jack said ""I am going to another pawn.  So it is safe to resign.  Therefore best was 39.Rb1 but with my passed pawns it's still lost for white.""  And we explored through different variations including giving me back a pawn or two.  But then he'd take a different pawn and promote.  After the game was over we discussed it and he said that I played very well.  In fact I did not give away a piece which after analyzing it here I actually did.  But it wasn't until 34.Be1?? which should've lost a R.  However he said that where I really went wrong was blundering a pawn or two which is what sealed my fate.  And that's where ""Don't give things away"" applies.  And that is a very typical theme.  In fact he brought me back in time and I reflected back on some of those GM annotations that I studied as there similar.  So in it Jack told me that Grandmaster's in general don't give away pieces which for them is hard to do.  But they do make a mistake that loses a pawn or two which is very easy to do but enough to lose the game.  The idea being is that those pawns make the difference in the endgame because it generally boils down to a one or two extra pawns that become passers which they'll use to Queen.  And when that happens it's lights out for their opponents."

In this case he doesn't but the idea also is that sometimes it pays off to boast about these unusual wins where you generally don't things the way they're supposed to done and win.  That's why although many people dislike it I (absolutely) enjoy it when tactical-abyss boasts (kibitzes) about his wins. 
70,2,3,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq e6',Standard.  But now Joe is going to give up his Queen for his N.  And with a close rating range I am already interested in seeing what's to come.
71,2,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',But after he sacs one the things Joe does is that he'll continue developing unless there is an extenuating circumstances that would delay it.  He has implied this in his club.
72,2,5,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2q2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',I don't know why black played this.  Not only doesn't it develop but black will either be forced to waist time to find a good outpost or place his Nb8 on the rim.
73,2,6,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2q2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Therefore Joe will waist no time in developing his pieces.
74,2,7,Bb4,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2q2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',And black now develops a piece.
75,2,8,Be2,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2q2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',But Joe continues as well.
76,2,9,h6,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2q1p/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',?! Not only don't I see the point but I deem this to be a waist of time.  That's because nothing is en-prise or threatened.  At least not to my knowing.  If I saw any clear danger it might be a different story.  In addition this will make it less safe for black to castle short as far as I'm concerned.  Therefore I would've played 6...d3 preparing to contest the center with a center pawn and develop the LSB.
77,2,10,a3,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2q1p/4p3/1b2P3/P1N2N2/1PPPBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',So I guess my instincts were right.  As a consequence of black's last move Joe plays this.  The idea being that agata will have to waist time.  And if he doesn't white will liquidate.  Although it's generally not a good to exchange pieces when behind I find this to be an extenuating circumstance because black's Bb4 is stronger then white Nc3 so exchanging should benefit white which is bound to happen.
78,2,11,d6,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/4P3/P1P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',And now black plays the move that I mentioned earlier.  However I still think it would've been more effective his sixth move then it is now especially since white got to exchange to his benefit.
79,2,12,Be3,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/4P3/P1P1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',With that being said Joe completes his development.
80,2,13,Nd7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/4P3/P1P1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black also continues.  The only issue is that it'll take time to complete development as we're about to see.  And that's why I also viewed 4...c6 as pointless.  In other words that's why I didn't see the point behind that move.
81,2,14,1Nd2,b'r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/4P3/P1P1B3/1PPNBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',This time I am not completely sure why Joe moved here.  But unlike his opponents I am able to make more sense of his move since tactical-abyss explains things very things.  I also base it on what Susan Polgar has previously told me.  So it's safe to infer that white played this to bring his N to a better outpost which is very familiar to me.  Although I like it I think I would've castled here.  But I don't find fault with this move at all.
82,2,15,1Nc5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/2n1p3/4P3/P1P1B3/1PPNBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',So black also brings his N to a better place.
83,2,16,1O-O-O,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/2n1p3/4P3/P1P1B3/1PPNBPPP/2KR3R b kq -',But I think that Joe is getting other things in exchange for his Q.  For example before black can complete development white castles.  Personally however I would've castled short.  So there has to be a reason why this is better but I am just not sure.  When it comes to tactical-abyss it is hard to figure things out but that is as he mentions good for theory.  But theory is the way to learn.  For example everything that I mentioned about visual imagery where you visulaize and analyze the board without being on the computer is also part of theory.
84,2,17,1Qe6,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2ppq2p/2n1p3/4P3/P1P1B3/1PPNBPPP/2KR3R w kq -',Putting pressure on the e file.  But I don't see the point.  Instead I would've castled short or played 11...Be6  Therefore it can't be as good but I am not sure why.  Meanwhile Joe will exchange.  Due to being behind I would've hold off.  In TA's case there are exceptions so I gather that black's N is stronger then white's DSB.  Which if that's true it makes sense then as exchanging would be to his benefit.
85,2,18,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2p1q2p/2p1p3/4P3/P1P3P1/1PPNBP1P/2KR3R b kq -',Now it makes sense as to why he didn't castle short.  Not sure the reason behind it but Joe's plan was to play this.  Therefore I don't know what it accomplishes but it must be something good.
86,2,19,1b5,b'r1b1k2r/p4pp1/2p1q2p/1pp1p3/4P3/P1P3P1/1PPNBP1P/2KR3R w kq b6',Fianchettoing so that when black does complete his development his B will be on a better diagnol.
87,2,20,1f4,b'r1b1k2r/p4pp1/2p1q2p/1pp1p3/4PP2/P1P3P1/1PPNB2P/2KR3R b kq f3',Joe intends to and will exchange pawns.  I don't know why he wanted to do this but my guess is to get another passed pawn which if so would have a potential to promote.  The idea being is that passed pawns are known to be very dangerous.
88,2,21,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p1q2p/1pp5/4PP2/P1P5/1PPNB2P/2KR3R w - -',And that's when black castles at last.
89,2,22,1h4,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p1q2p/1pp5/4PP1P/P1P5/1PPNB3/2KR3R b - h3',I believe that Joe is already playing through some long variations and is attempting or even figuring out how to get another passed pawn since taking on f4 already gave him one.  That's because if he does then I understand the logic behind this perfectly well as the idea is that you should bring your R behind a passed well.  Afterall that is a well known chess fact.  I guess a possible continuation would then be for TA to move his LSB and after that play Rdf1.  It is however a very interesting position. 
90,2,23,1a5,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/2p1q2p/ppp5/4PP1P/P1P5/1PPNB3/2KR3R w - a6',And I gather that black has the same idea in mind.
91,2,24,1e5,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/2p1q2p/ppp1P3/5P1P/P1P5/1PPNB3/2KR3R b - -',Not exactly sure what Joe has in mind here but I would've played 17.f5 and when the Q retreats that's when I'd answer with f5 and that way we're talking about keeping a solid pawn chain until one hits the sixth rank where it's known to be dangerous.  But given his style I believe that white is planning on a way to do that.
92,2,25,1b4,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/2p1q2p/p1p1P3/1p3P1P/P1P5/1PPNB3/2KR3R w - -',Going for a pawn exchange because black I believe is thinking along the lines of 18.axb3 with the idea of undoubling his pawns after 18...cxb3 and after 19.axb3 axb3 black has an open h file which is known to be very dangerous.
93,2,26,1Nb3,b'r1b2rk1/5pp1/2p1q2p/p1p1P3/1p3P1P/PNP5/1PP1B3/2KR3R b - -',So Joe was not going to allow and instead counters that by threatening to win another pawn.
94,2,27,1Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/2p4p/p1p1P3/1p3P1P/PNP5/1PP1B3/2KR3R w - -',Which black must now protect.
95,2,28,1Rd6,b'r1b2rk1/4qpp1/2pR3p/p1p1P3/1p3P1P/PNP5/1PP1B3/2K4R b - -',So Joe goes after another pawn.  And black will stop that after exchanging another set of pawns.
96,2,29,Be6,b'r4rk1/4qpp1/2pRb2p/p1p1P3/5P1P/PNP5/2P1B3/2K4R w - -',Which black stops.
97,2,30,2c4,b'r4rk1/4qpp1/2pRb2p/p1p1P3/2P2P1P/PN6/2P1B3/2K4R b - -',However I would've taken on b3 anyway but seeing that Joe doesn't do this I realize that it would be an inaccuracy.  I guess it's because white's N is stronger then black's B.  Therefore this would result in losing an exchange which would not be good here.
98,2,31,2Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/4qpp1/2pRb2p/p1p1P3/2P2P1P/PN6/2P1B3/2K4R w - -',Putting pressure on the d file.
99,2,32,2Rd3,b'r2r2k1/4qpp1/2p1b2p/p1p1P3/2P2P1P/PN1R4/2P1B3/2K4R b - -',Which Joe counters as now an exchange doesn't look as bad for white.
100,2,33,a4,b'r5k1/4qpp1/2p1b2p/2p1P3/p1P2P1P/PN1B4/2P5/2K4R w - -',Hitting the N.
101,2,34,2Nd2,b'r5k1/4qpp1/2p1b2p/2p1P3/p1P2P1P/P2B4/2PN4/2K4R b - -',And for a change I am not surprised to see Joe retreating here as this is also what I would've played.
102,2,35,2Qd7,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p1b2p/2p1P3/p1P2P1P/P2B4/2PN4/2K4R w - -',Putting pressure on the d file.  However I don't see the point as the B isn't pinned.  If white's LSB were to move black can't capture the N due to white's monarch.
103,2,36,2Nf3,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p1b2p/2p1P3/p1P2P1P/P2B1N2/2P5/2K4R b - -',With that being said Joe finds a better outpost for his N.
104,2,37,2Bf5,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p4p/2p1Pb2/p1P2P1P/P2B1N2/2P5/2K4R w - -',agata is very determined to get rid of white's B I guess because it poses as a danger.
105,2,38,2Re1,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p4p/2p1Pb2/p1P2P1P/P2B1N2/2P5/2K1R3 b - -',But Joe has other idea as otherwise he wouldn't give away his B.  So it's safe to infer that white is giving it away for when black takes white would have something dangerous in mind. I'm not sure exactly what it is because when all is said and done black will pick up another piece.  What I do know however based on visual imagery is that white is calculating something dangerous afterwards.
106,2,39,2Bxd3,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p4p/2p1P3/p1P2P1P/P2b1N2/2P5/2K1R3 w - -',So the plan starts here.
107,2,40,2e6,b'r5k1/3q1pp1/2p1P2p/2p5/p1P2P1P/P2b1N2/2P5/2K1R3 b - -',That's because when black takes white will fork and get the B and when black takes back on c4...
108,2,41,3Re5,b'r5k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2p1R3/p1q2P1P/P2N4/2P5/2K5 b - -',This happens.  However I would've captured with 30.Rxe6  But Joe has a reason for doing what he does.  And it's important to figure what that would be as that's what theory is about.
109,2,42,3Qd4,b'r5k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2p1R3/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2P5/2K5 w - -',So black plays this with the idea being to hit on white's N since ...c4 is a possiblity.
110,2,43,3Rxc5,b'r5k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2R5/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2P5/2K5 b - -',As a result Joe stops that by capturing.
111,2,44,3Rb8,b'1r4k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2R5/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2P5/2K5 w - -',So white has an answer that.  And that is by threatening 32...Qa1+  Now as Homework I have studied it and I found the answer as there's no mate.  But this was after a lot of difficulties putting right in the top 5 most difficult HW assignments I've ever done.  The idea being is that black is threatening to win another pawn which white cannot risk.  So after 32...Qa1+ 33.Kd2 (forced) Qxa4 (immediately).
112,2,45,3Kd2,b'1r4k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2R5/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2PK4/8 b - -',So Joe protects because if 32...Qa1 white now answers with 32.Ra5
113,2,46,3Rb1,b'6k1/6p1/2p1p2p/2R5/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2PK4/1r6 w - -',Therefore black has other ideas but I'm not sure what they are.  The reason why I don't know is that ...Qa1 followed by ...Rd1+ isn't mate as white would be able to get out with Ke3  But agata has something up his sleeve for sure.
114,2,47,3Rxc6,b'6k1/6p1/2R1p2p/8/p2q1P1P/P2N4/2PK4/1r6 b - -',So Joe takes.
115,2,48,3Qe4,b'6k1/6p1/2R1p2p/8/p3qP1P/P2N4/2PK4/1r6 w - -',Like before black intends to do something.  But this time he intends to win white's R.
116,2,49,3Rc8+,b'2R3k1/6p1/4p2p/8/p3qP1P/P2N4/2PK4/1r6 b - -',As Joe is not going to give anything else away he places black in check.  And when agata gets out that is when white will centralize his K.  That's right the idea is that in the endgame when you're at a disadvantage you want to bring the monarch closer to the center.  In doing so you will last longer.  And yes it is something that I taught one of my students.
117,2,50,3Kh7,b'2R5/6pk/4p2p/8/p3qP1P/P2N4/2PK4/1r6 w - -',It is a little too early to tell but my inference is that we're going into the same category as what I know about standard endgames.  That black is intending to form a fortress where white's K would be locked in the corner.  The reason is that one generally confines the K to one square until you can force a mate.  I think that this is what black intends to do.  The only other reason for this inference is that aside from that I have no idea why else agata would move here.  So I was trying to do a little Homework here by forming a hypothesis. 
118,2,51,3Kc3,b'2R5/6pk/4p2p/8/p3qP1P/P1KN4/2P5/1r6 b - -',But is my instincts are right Joe has prevented that.
119,2,52,3Qd5,b'2R5/6pk/4p2p/3q4/p4P1P/P1KN4/2P5/1r6 w - -',Of course black has other ideas.  But this time not only do I have no idea but can't even guess.  
120,2,53,3Rc4,b'8/6pk/4p2p/3q4/p1R2P1P/P1KN4/2P5/1r6 b - -',But as usual Joe does since he can calculates variations.  And when this happens the immediate response shows.
121,2,54,3Rb5,b'8/6pk/4p2p/1r1q4/p1R2P1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 w - -',Like before black is threatening to do something.
122,2,55,3Rxa4,b'8/6pk/4p2p/1r1q4/R4P1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 b - -',So white takes.
123,2,56,3Qc6+,b'8/6pk/2q1p2p/1r6/R4P1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 w - -',And black checks.
124,2,57,3Rc4,b'8/6pk/2q1p2p/1r6/2R2P1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 b - -',And Joe gets out by interceding a piece.  Personally I would've played 38.Kd2 so it can't be as good given that white didn't respond that way.  In fact I know why because from visualization and seeing what happens next white will for the most part fully recompensate for lost material.  In addition I also remember something important from GM Susan Polgar.  During an e-mail course (that I took) she said that when in check one should not assume that the way to get out is with the King.  Instead it is sometimes better to interpose a piece which makes sense here and for the reason mentioned earlier.
125,2,58,3Rc5,b'8/6pk/2q1p2p/2r5/2R2P1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 w - -',To minimize the damage black brings his R to c5.  For had he not Joe would've won back the Q but now he is only getting a R.  Although that's significant it's certainly a lot better then losing the Queen.
126,2,59,Qe4,b'8/6pk/4p2p/2R5/4qP1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 w - -',And of course black dare not take for the obvious reason so agata moved here instead.
127,2,60,4Ra5,b'8/6pk/4p2p/R7/4qP1P/P1KN4/2P5/8 b - -',But I am not sure why Joe played this.  Meanwhile black will deliver some annoying checks.
128,2,61,4Kc3,b'8/6pk/4p2p/R7/5P1P/P1KN4/2P3q1/8 b - -',It is worth noting that the monarch is a powerful weapon during the endgame.  So my guess is that Joe moved here to make his K dangerous.
129,2,62,4Qh2,b'8/6pk/4p2p/R7/5P1P/P1KN4/2P4q/8 w - -',Going right after h3.
130,2,63,4Kb3,b'8/6pk/4p2p/R7/5P1P/PK1N4/2P4q/8 b - -',Given what I mentioned Joe allows black to take.  In addition with this move we have now accomplished triangulation (which is the trigonometric method).  The idea being that white's K moved to d2 followed c3 and then b3 so it has moved in a triangle.  Now this is very effective in an endgame.
131,2,64,4Kc3,b'8/6pk/4p2p/R7/5P1q/P1KN4/2P5/8 b - -',Continuing the triangulation.
132,2,65,4Qf6+,b'8/6pk/4pq1p/R7/5P2/P1KN4/2P5/8 w - -',And black decides to check.
133,2,66,4Kb3,b'8/6pk/4pq1p/R7/5P2/PK1N4/2P5/8 b - -',Another option was to interpose with 45.Ne5 or 45.Re5 but I don't like those two as well as now one of the pieces would remain pin.  Therefore this move is also what I would've played and in it's important to remember that Joe is still triangulating.
134,2,67,4Qg6,b'8/6pk/4p1qp/R7/5P2/PK1N4/2P5/8 w - -',I am not sure why black this as white's N is not pinned for if it moved agata could not take due to white's N.
135,2,68,4Ka2,b'8/6pk/4p1qp/R7/5P2/P2N4/K1P5/8 b - -',Continuing the triangulation.  But in this case I would not have played it as now the N is really pinned.  However due to to Joe's rating it's important to try to figure it out as this still blends in with theory.  So my guess is that he moved here to add an extra defender to his c2 pawn.
136,2,69,4h5,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R6p/5P2/P2N4/K1P5/8 w - -',With one of his passed pawns agata attempts to promote.
137,2,70,4Kb1,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R6p/5P2/P2N4/2P5/1K6 b - -',But Joe will stop at nothing to prevent that.  And that is especially because of what I noted earlier about centralization as white is centralizing his K.  The idea is that he'll move it towards and passed the center with the idea of making right near the pawn.  That way if black were to advance too far white would just take that pawn.  It does require a lot of moves though but it's good practice because I am calculating possible variations.
138,2,71,4h4,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R7/5P1p/P2N4/2P5/1K6 w - -',Which starts here as this is the move that I predicted.
139,2,72,4Kb2,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R7/5P1p/P2N4/1KP5/8 b - -',But this however is not a move that was in my calculation.  Instead my inference was that Joe would play 48.Kc1 and if 48...h3  However my variations fail because after 49.Kd1 h2 now the pawn will promote after 50.Ke1  Therefore I'm interested in knowing how this stops the promotion.  That's because another move that comes to mind (which appears to work) was the immediate 48.Nf2 to prevent 48...h3  However once black plays that this is when white will bring his N to f2.  
140,2,73,h2,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R7/5P2/P7/1KP2N1p/8 w - -',However it now makes sense because this will also stop the promotion.
141,2,74,5Kb3,b'8/6pk/4p1q1/R7/5P2/PK6/2P2N1p/8 b - -',?? Unlike before I don't know why Joe played this but my guess would be to continue with his triangulation.  However black can and will win the N.  On the other hand it's worth noting that according to what tactical-abyss implied taking the N is where black will start to go wrong.  That's because he said that black was winning until the last few moves which is we're we have arrived.
142,2,75,5Kb3,b'8/6pk/4p3/R7/5P2/PK6/2P2q1p/8 b - -',However it starts making sense because if black were to Queen Joe would continue to advance his c pawn until it surpasses the 5th rank then a possible continuation would bringing the R up and placing black in check followed by advancing the a pawn.  So although it looks like black is clearly going to win I'm going by what TA stated due to the fact that chess is a complex game.  In fact we start seeing that on the next move when black delivers check as opposed to promotion.
143,2,76,5Kb4,b'8/6pk/4p3/R7/1K3P2/P3q3/2P4p/8 b - -',Keeping his a3 and c2 pawns protected.
144,2,77,5Qd4+,b'8/6pk/4p3/R7/1K1q1P2/P7/2P4p/8 w - -',Once again black decides to put pressure right on white's monarch.  Personally I would've done that but with 53...Qxf4+ as now I don't see anything wrong with it.  Afterall white would still in check so black would get something else.  Therefore my hypothesis is that black is running out of time which when that happens you don't concentrate as well.  I know because I was clearly winning against my student Mary but in the end I made a grave mistake that lost as I was running low on time.
145,2,78,5Kb3,b'8/6pk/4p3/R7/3q1P2/PK6/2P4p/8 b - -',Protecting one of his passed pawns for had Joe played 54.Kb5 (which was the only other option) black has 54...Qb2+ in which the c2 pawn would fall.  After that I believe that it would be lights out for white.
146,2,79,5Qd5+,b'8/6pk/4p3/R2q4/5P2/PK6/2P4p/8 w - -',?? My guess is that black wanted to put extra pressure on white.  But the problem is that this gives away the Q for a R.  By then white I think would clearly win.  As noted before however mistakes or blunders often happen when you're running low on time.  In fact that's one reason I don't play blitz that often though it might start realizing that they're in seperate categories from long correspondence chess games.  And I recently got tips from TA on how to play blitz without feeling rushed in my actual games.
147,2,80,5Kb2,b'8/6pk/4p3/R2q4/5P2/P7/1KP4p/8 b - -',Talk about time management were we not low on this I think that white would've played 55.Rxd5  But in this case it doesn't matter because black timed out.  Joe said as noted that up until the last 5 moves black was clearly winning.  But things changed towards the end and had there been plenty of time like several days he would've won.  With almost any other chess player I'd disagree but not with tactical-abyss.  The idea being is that he really knows his theory.  And in doing so he calculates and visualizes more variations then any of us as Joe sees things differently.  As usual however I'm glad that I took the time to study another Q sac especially of this kind for Homework.  Once again it shows just how much there really is to learn as he points out in a threat.  The thread was actually on the topic and in it he presented this game.  The idea being is that a lot of people say that Joe only wins because he played against much lower rated players.  But with this game I know that it isn't so because in this case he played against someone of about his strength sacced his Q (as usual) and still won.  In addition one of the main ways that I've improved was by studying games like this.  As a result this is also how I was able to teach chess to one of my students.  That's because she used to resign just by being a minor piece down.  But after remembering what Jack Stockel as well as TA's Q sac's I convinced her not to resign.  She remembered that and got a stalemate in what was a lost position.  And in a different game the student had another lost position but her opponent failed to take her Q after making another big mistake.  In doing so and after more blunders my student was able to pull a swindle by winning a game that ought to have been lost.

320,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Like me Mary's favorite is also the KPO.  And of course I answer with the Siclian Defense.
321,8,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',After the discussion last week I anticipated 2.Nf3  But she made a very good point when I called it an inaccuracy.  Since I felt that I was being a little critical last week I wasn't going to say anything this time.
322,8,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I continue with my defense.
323,8,3,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',?! At this point a small conversation ensues as I implied that this was an inaccuracy.  I didn't want to get into a lot of details because even though Jack is not there talking too much would distract which I (inadvertently) due later on and feel very bad about.  Joe: Putting limits on the LSB  Mary: What's that?  Joe: In other words it restricts your LSB.  What I mean is that her Bf1 is confined to only one square which is e2  It's not a bad bishop but it won't be as welled placed as a result.  And the idea being is that you don't want to voluntarily tie down your own pieces which I'm afraid that she has done.  
324,8,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Meanwhile I continue developing.
325,8,5,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1PP2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',?! I wasn't going to say anything right away as sometimes you can get the f pawn into play.  And I thought (especially due to not being that energetic) that she was defending a pawn.  However I got the colors mixed up as otherwise I would've said something immediately.  But later on I will imply it when a difficult situation arises for her.  It is very much worth noting that it falls pretty much into the same category as the Domino's Defense or what tactical-abyss notes in his Q sac.  You should not voluntarily remove the f pawn because f2 and f7 are considered the weakest squares on the chess board.  Once that pawn is removed you often wind up in trouble.
326,8,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P1PP2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Taking advantage of a potential weakness I continue developing.
327,8,7,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P1PP2/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So does she.
328,8,8,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P1PPb1/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But with that being said I decided to do more by pinning her N in the process.
329,8,9,h3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P1PPb1/3P1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now I asked myself what could be done here.  
330,8,10,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P1PP2/3P1b1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I actually thought that the only other option was retreating to h4.  But I was not going to it this time.  Unlike before this would've lost a piece.  With that being said if 6...Bh5?? 7.g4 Bg6 and after 8.f5 my B is trapped.  Therefore I thought that this was my only choice.  But after reanalyzing this I realize that 6...Bd7  But even so I like this the best and therefore would've played it.  The idea being is that if I went to d7 my K and Q would be somwhat crammed in.  And I would be in a little bit of an uncomfortable position.  By playing this we go into a different exchange variation that I happen to like.
331,8,11,Nd4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2PnPP2/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',That is because I respond with this.  And the idea as I note on the next move is to punish black for bringing out her f pawn early as opposed to continue developing.
332,8,12,Qg3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2PnPP2/3P2QP/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',?? However this is a blunder which I will later note.
333,8,13,Nc2+,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P1PP2/3P2QP/PPn3P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Mary: This is not a good position.  Joe: The problem is that your pieces are not developed.  So there are not a lot of options in this position.  I said that to emphasize the points that Jack has made.  In fact last week he emphasized how important it is for her to follow General Opening Guidelines which I said in my last win with her.   That is to develop your pieces control the center and get the K to safety.  As she said which I nodded (after the game was over) what made things difficult was the opening itself.  In fact just before I joined this website come to think of it this is something that he told me as well.  And I tell that to some of my students and all of them remember this.  But then something occurs as she could've protected her R.  Seeing this I said something after taking.  Meanwhile Mary decides to attack my N before I take which I find quite smart as you might as well get aggressive.
334,8,14,Nxa1,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P1PP2/3P2QP/PP4P1/nNBK1B1R w kq -',So it was at this point where I realized that I made a mistake in my coaching and told her how that R could've been protected.  In it I said best was 8.Qf2 which would've prevented my Knight from coming on the second rank.  This implies that as a result I couldn't have gotten the Rook and she nodded her head.
335,8,15,1e5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/2P2P2/3P2QP/PP4P1/nNBK1B1R b kq -',Going after my N which will soon be under attack anyhow.  So I decide to exchange pawns first.  That's because my plan is to do something nasty.  However I did not realize it was unsound.  My thinking was that she would have more difficulties but this is where my lack of energy gets the best of me.  It's important to note that on this day it was atypical November weather.  Not only was it cloudy and a little rainy but it was quite muggy and disgusting in the process.  We were near record temps and a lot of people were feeling this affect.  But in this process I made a terrible miscalculation.
336,8,16,Ne4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/2P1n3/3P2QP/PP4P1/nNBK1B1R w kq -',?? With that being said it starts here.  With that being said the reason I exchanged was to land my N here and create a nasty threat by putting pressure right on the Q.  Of course my idea was defending the N and in the process of gaining tempo I could complete my development and castle.  But with this move however she is going to win back my N which I'm not proud of this mistake at all.  In addition 11...Nd7 came to mind but I felt that my N would be crammed and would then lose more time especially since bringing back near the homesquare puts me in uncomfortable position.  The idea being is that I was counting the fact that my Q side would be limited which I didn't want and I was basing on a past game.  However I had to move the N back to either d7 or g8 as this was the only protect it.   
337,8,17,1Qf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/2P1n3/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/nNBK1B1R b kq -',This is how she will do it.  As no matter where I go she can take.  Now I thought I had one way out.
338,8,18,1Ng5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p1P1n1/2P5/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/nNBK1B1R w kq -',But I overlooked the DSB.  No matter how you look at it how she was going to get it and with my N trapped on a1 she is going to win that (thus) recompensating for lost material.
339,8,19,Rb8,b'1r1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p1P1B1/2P5/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/nN1K1B1R w k -',After that blunder to prevent any further loss I saw that b7 was en-prise and asked how to protect it.  I also considered 13...b7 which at the time I thought I'd lose my R if I did so.  Of course I forgot about my Qd8 (which is directly affiliated with how tired I was on that day).  That would've also protected and given my a nice pawn chain.  But had this not been overlooked I still would've played this regardless.  The idea being is that had I protected the other way I would've lost castling rights.  For example 13...b7 14.Qc6+ Qb7 15.Qxb7 Kxb7  With that another small chat ensues.  Mary: Darn!  Joe: I had to protect b7.  Mary: You could afford it.  But I shook my head no.  Yes I'm still ahead but I refuse to give anything else away voluntarily.
340,8,20,1Bf4,b'1r1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/2P2B2/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/nN1K1B1R b k -',Her plan involves going after my R.  That is because would advance her e5 so that I'd be forced to give up a pawn to avoid losing a R for B which I won't allow.
341,8,21,1e6,b'1r1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1P3/2P2B2/3P1Q1P/PP4P1/nN1K1B1R w k -',Therefore I find the only move to stop this.  I also looked at 14...Qxd3+ to stop but didn't consider this move.  Although a little tired I wasn't severely fatigued or dizzy for had I been that super blunder would've been extremely likely.
342,8,22,1Nc3,b'1r1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1P3/2P2B2/2NP1Q1P/PP4P1/n2K1B1R b k -',Preparing to win my N which I know can't be defended.
343,8,23,1Qd4,b'1r2kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1P3/2Pq1B2/2NP1Q1P/PP4P1/n2K1B1R w k -',I also looked at 15...Qa5 and 15...Qb4 with the idea of knabbing one of those pawns.  But white Mary would be able to defend with her N.  Had I been better I might have played one of those two candidate moves.  But I decided to respond with this thinking that her Nc3 is indirectly pinned.  It appears that moving it would lose a pawn but she can still defend this with 16.Na4
344,8,24,1Be3,b'1r2kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1P3/2Pq4/2NPBQ1P/PP4P1/n2K1B1R b k -',? But she goes after my Q.  Joe: This isn't the best move because I can win another pawn.  Better was to leave your Bishop on f5 where that pawn was protected and she nodded her head.
345,8,25,1Kc1,b'1r2kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1q3/2P5/2NPBQ1P/PP4P1/n1K2B1R b k -',But once Mary played this that's when I realized that she would equalize by winning my other N.
346,8,26,1g5,b'1r2kb1r/pp3p1p/4p3/2p1q1p1/2P5/2NPBQ1P/PP4P1/n1K2B1R w k g6',Due to limits on my concentration I was worried that Mary might have threats against me and was determined to prevent it.  Otherwise I would've done the standard fianchetto with 17...g6  Come to think of it what concerned me was white strengthening her pawn chain on g2 and h3.  With this move after g5 she can't advance further.  And what I also bared in mind is that she would not take on g5 due to my Q.
347,8,27,Bg7,b'1r2k2r/pp3pbp/4p3/2p1q1p1/2P5/2NPBQ1P/PP4P1/nK3B1R w k -',Knowing that she is going my N I decide to complete development.  And when Mary takes that's when I'll castle at once.
348,8,28,2g4,b'1r3rk1/pp3pbp/4p3/2p1q1p1/2P3P1/2NPBQ1P/PP6/K4B1R b - g3',And Mary advances afterall.  So I feel that 17...g5 was the right decision but it is important to know since pawn chains are of my concern that this is one of the few positions where it would not have been a major asset.  For example before it advanced with my g pawn she would not have gotten a passed pawn which is what went through my mind.
349,8,29,2Rfd8,b'1r1r2k1/pp3pbp/4p3/2p1q1p1/2P3P1/2NPBQ1P/PP6/K4B1R w - -',Remembering what happened in my game against bhdiragon (and thus) bearing in mind that Mary's Q is cut off from her DSB making it out of play I decide to go right after d3 pawn.  That is especially because we're nearing the endgame and bearing that I'm her teacher I'm doing whatever I can to prevent her from forcing a win despite the one mistake which does this.
350,8,30,2h4,b'1r1r2k1/pp3pbp/4p3/2p1q1p1/2P3PP/2NPBQ2/PP6/K4B1R b - -',But she finds an interesting way to protect it.  Now I had a hard time evaluating between taking right away on d3 or not.  The only reason why I didn't is the fact it's protected by her LSB.  The interesting fact is that I almost overlooked this and therefore came close to losing a R for a pawn.  After ruling it out exchanging on h4 came to mind but taking there would leave Mary with an open h file which I wasn't going allow.  And that was of course with one of TA's unusual Q sacs.  He sacked in an unusual spot and won.  One of the main reasons is because he allowed Joe to maintain an open h file which was used to his advantage. 
351,8,31,2f5,b'1r1r2k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p1qpp1/2P3PP/2NPBQ2/PP6/K4B1R w - f6',Therefore I decide to exchange this way.  What I had anticipated was 22.gxf5 in which I'd recapture with 22...exf5  In fact this was her best move.
352,8,32,2Bxg5,b'1r1r2k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p1qpB1/2P3PP/2NP1Q2/PP6/K4B1R b - -',?? Now I didn't say anything right away because you can't necessarily prove one thing right away in this position.  But later on I imply that this was a blunder.  At first I thought that this was a good move because I was thinking about how to protect Rd8.  Then it occured to me that this was no of concern because of my next move which would not have been possible if she did not remove her Be3.
353,8,33,2Qe1+,b'1r1r2k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p2pB1/2P3PP/2NP1Q2/PP6/K3qB1R w - -',Bearing in mind that Mary can't use her K to get out.  And once she does I will take another pawn.  That's because I have a plan when she takes back.  But in this position what do I intend to do.
354,8,34,Rd4,b'1r4k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p3B1/2Pr2QP/3P4/PP6/K2NqB1R w - -',And with her next move I'll reattack thus adding pressure to the first rank which was my plan.  Of course she can move her Q elsewhere but that would limit her options.  For example 25.Qh5 limits her mobility which also makes the situation difficult.  Therefore I said interesting position.  By letting me place you in check you wound up in trouble.  By this I'm indirectly pointed out why 22.Bxg5? was a mistake.  But Mary understood what I was getting at because she nodded her head.
355,8,35,2Qf3,b'1r4k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P1Q2/PP6/K2NqB1R b - -',But with this move however I will reattack adding more pressure against the first rank.
356,8,36,2Rf8,b'5rk1/pp4bp/4p3/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P1Q2/PP6/K2NqB1R w - -',Mary: Persistent aren't we?  Joe: Yep.
357,8,37,2Qh5,b'5rk1/pp4bp/4p3/2p3BQ/2Pr3P/3P4/PP6/K2NqB1R b - -',At first I was going to tell Mary that was a better move.  I was thinking 26.Qe2 to protect the N.  But I stopped myself from saying anything as the last part of the Q's diagnol involves d1.  Therefore her N was a goner one way or another.  In fact no matter what she goes I will win more material even after taking.
358,8,38,2Qe8+,b'4Q1k1/pp4bp/4p3/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P4/PP6/K2Nqr1R b - -',But Mary prolongs the capture by placing me in check as my next move will be forced.  After that whether she takes or not I win more material.  The idea being is that if she doesn't take on f1 then I will.    
359,8,39,2Qxe6+,b'5bk1/pp5p/4Q3/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P4/PP6/K2N1q2 b - -',That however does not stop Mary from getting another pawn.  Now I looked at different options.  However there was only one other move which I strongly considered and almost played.  That was 29...Kh8 and the idea being is what Jack said about how important it is to bring your monarch into the corner.  However it doesn't work here.  If I had played that she would won a piece and this time without compensation.  That is especially because we're in the endgame.  So if 29...Kh8?? 30.Bf6+ and after 30...Qxf6 31.Qxf6 losing the Q for her DSB. 
360,8,40,2Qf7,b'5bk1/pp3q1p/4Q3/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P4/PP6/K2N4 w - -',Therefore this was the only other alternative.  In fact I wouldn't mind exchanging Q's here.
361,8,41,3Qc8,b'2Q2bk1/pp3q1p/8/2p3B1/2Pr3P/3P4/PP6/K2N4 b - -',But Mary doesn't accept.  Given however that her d3 is still boxed in and can't escape I decide to it.  Afterall this wins another pawn.  Of course I still need to watch my back as we're about to see.  This is due to not just the tactics she used two weeks ago but how she's playing now (espeically since Jack isn't there to help her out).
362,8,42,3Qg4,b'5bk1/pp3q1p/8/2p3B1/2P3QP/3r4/PP6/K2N4 b - -',The idea is to protect d1.  But what Mary doesn't know is that her N cannot be defended due to my next move.
363,8,43,3Qf1,b'5bk1/pp5p/8/2p3B1/2P3QP/3r4/PP6/K2N1q2 w - -',And that is due to the extra attacker I have on f1.  With that being said this move is going to prevent her from taking back when I capture on d1.
364,8,44,3a3,b'5bk1/pp5p/8/2p3B1/2P3QP/P2r4/1P6/K2N1q2 b - -',But having had figured out what's going on and the threat that ensues afterwards Mary makes the right choice and opens up.  The idea being is that if she didn't do so then what I mentioned would've become a mate.  So that would've been 32...Rxd1+ 33.Qxd1 (forced) Qxd1#  And after this game we discussed it and she implied that she saw this threat by saying that if this move wasn't played I would've mated.  And I told her that she was right.  In fact I was very impressed by this comment because it shows improvement.  Before this student has missed similar back rank threats.  It's also worth noting that white is taking a lot of time as there was only enough time for this game last Friday.
365,8,45,Ra1+,b'5bk1/pp5p/8/2p3B1/2P3QP/P7/KP6/r4q2 w - -',Given that the last move was forced I decided to play this.  Believe it or not I am thinking of a long term mating threat.  But seeing that her next move forced I realized that I couldn't.
366,8,46,Qb1,b'5bk1/pp5p/8/2p3B1/2P3QP/PK6/1P6/rq6 w - -',?? But at this is 11:48 a.m. and due to my work schedule I have no choice but to leave by noon.  How I knew is that we both looked at our watch so time management was becoming an issue.  In this case Mary also had to leave at noon.  So I figured that I'd put pressure on her and then go for mate.  But with the situation that I mentioned I didn't take enough to focus on the situation so it became Flip Coin Chess as opposed to Real Chess.  Consequently this loses.  For a while I asked if there was anything I could've done differently and believe it or not got distracted at work trying to think about it.  Sure visualization is a good thing but too much of a good thing can be bad.  At first I thought that there was just too many mistakes from me feeling bad.  Then I looked back and got the reflection on how well Mary did and realize that one of the pieces she won was not due to a blunder.  Instead it was stuck because if I moved it past the 8th rank she would've taken regardless.  But with this move I'm in a lot of trouble after how white responds.  With that being said best was 34...Qd1+ in which forces white to liquidate while I'm ahead.  From there I should win.  But the only problem is that when the game was over there was less then 10 minutes to spare.  So I had I played it right I think we would've assumed that I won.  But it would still be unfinished.  Therefore I would've recorded this as still in progress as opposed to 1-0.  As a result this was better in a way because we got to at least finish the game.
367,8,47,3Qe6+,b'5bk1/pp5p/4Q3/2p3B1/2P4P/PK6/1P6/rq6 b - -',?? At this point we were down to only 10 minutes.  Taking a lot more time would've exceeded this.  So I only spent a minute or two to analyze in order to prevent the game from timing out.  The only move I considered though was 35...Kh8  This time however it was due to Jack's advice of bringing your monarch into the corner as it's part of K safety.  After the game I asked myself if there were any other options.  The answer is that there was only one other move which also leads to mate.  It was 35...Kg7 and I would've lasted longer because after 36.Bf6+ I can play 36...Bh6  But I am almost convinced that white would still mate sooner or later.  Bringing my K to h8 is going to allow white to mate me much sooner.
368,8,48,3Bf6+,b'5b1k/pp5p/4QB2/2p5/2P4P/PK6/1P6/rq6 b - -',"Now we were down to 8 minutes and after this move I resigned.  In the end we discussed why I was resigning and at first Mary thought that resignation was premature.  I showed her the reason that it wasn't.  So the first thing I told her was that my K cannot move which she agreed.  Therefore I'm only left with one move which is 36...Bg7 after that she showed me how she would've responded and that was 37.Qe8#  So when she did I said that it would be mate.  Mary said ""Oh yeah I see.""  In the end my student was thankful and told me that she learned a lot in this game thus implying that I'm also a good teacher.  The main thing that Mary mentioned was what went wrong in the opening.  In it she said the opening is what got her into trouble.  And I nodded with a happy face because of what Jack has said.  By mentioning that she is starting to connect the dots and see the big picture by understanding why following the basic openings is important.  She also mentioned something else which made me smile.  It was the fact that white had to open up with 32.a3 and recognized that I would've mated on the back rank if she had not done that.  And I told her that this would've happened to point out that she's right.  With that being said given that this student has made progress if I play her again it will be like how it was with bhidragon.  So next time I won't make any comment even if a mistake or blunder is made.  And after it's over we'll analyze so it'll be like a rated game.  In addition as noted since the main coach wasn't there and making changes we discussed a little more.  Therefore as sonata296 accurately stated in my last game against her this time it did distract the other players that were there which I felt bad about.  However if she has a question I feel that I must answer.  But I'll be as brief as possible.  Refusing to answer the questions in my opinion is an equivalent to putting someone on your ignore list for no good reason which is against my moral.

Our preferred playstyles positions openings and approach to the game are about as different as can be. This is already shown as soon as move 1 where he plays e4 whereas I'll stick to my favoured d4. For example: I prefer my positions closed and with room for some error where I can slowly grind my opponent into creating small weaknesses that I can later take advantage of. In contrast he usually has the tendency to create open positions in which there are many complications and where the opposing player usually has to play incredibly accurate to survive. The moves or sacrifices he plays aren't always 100% correct ( the computer will often agree with me on this point ) but the positions he creates often pressure the opponent in overlooking a small detail or making an error. As such there's a lot we can learn from each other and our games become rather exciting every once in a while.
518,15,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Closed Sicilian. I know that Bert used to play the Alapin however nowadays he prefers the grand prix attack from what I've heard. My experience versus the grand prix is very limited as not a lot of people tend to play it here in Belgium so I don't really know the opening theory behind it. We'll somehow manage.
519,15,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Taking a more waiting approach. Usually I'd just bust e6 out immediately however in the closed Sicilian I like to wait a bit longer to see what exact variation we're playing so that I change it up by playing d6 instead if I deem it better.
520,15,3,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',And this is the point where I realize we're going to be playing the Grand Prix attack. It's not that popular among players because it's deemed that Black equalises too easily if they actually know what they're doing but it's definitely playable at the clublevel and in my opinion leads to interesting games.
521,15,4,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I was considering Qc7 for a second going for my usual Taimanov setup and getting rid of booktheory immediately but it didn't feel quite as convincing. I wasn't too scared of Nb5 or Nd5 as it's common in the Taimanov to answer that threat with Qb8 but I didn't want my queen all the way on b8 since I knew that a strong attacking plan would be coming my way rather soon ( as e5 or f5 are common plans in the grand prix for white to start up an attack ) and a queen on b8 doesn't exactly help in defending that. Instead I opt for g6 with the idea of playing Bg7. My pawn on c5 probably won't be fiercely attacked and it's easy to defend it with d6 later so I'd rather have my bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal where it's really strong. g6 is also the main line according to Bert which surprised me a little.

Qc7 looks a bit strange because of Nd5 however I thought about it for a second and after 6.Nd5 Qb8 7.d3 e6 8. Nc3 a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 Nd4 I think black is doing just fine. Black is getting a lot of space on the queenside which is what usually happens in the Taimanov and Kan variations of the open Sicilian that I like to play in exchange for vulnerable dark squared diagonals but that shouldn't be an issue with my dark squared bishop being placed on g7. At the very least I'd be very familiar with the attacking plans of Black if nothing else considering the similarity it'd have with what I usually play. I assume Qc7 isn't one of the mainlines because there's a better alternative but at the very least I thought it was interesting.

His king is also relatively safe there as it's not easy for black to actually make use of the dark a7-g1 diagonal. At the same time he's also inviting black to capture on f4 which would most likely end up in a disaster as it's an easy square for White to attack and White will most likely get compensation with either center control ( with for example d4 ) or maybe several tempi and the quick development of all his pieces.
525,15,8,a6,b'r1b1k1nr/1pqpppbp/p1n3p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Attacking the bishop. if he retreats Ill push b5 and try my chances there in the future. If he captures I get the bishop pair. I don't mind either situation.

I'd assume he'd want as many pieces on the board for his eventual attack so I thought it a little bit strange at first but it has a few good reasons when you think about it. He probably felt like his bishop wouldn't do a lot on b3 and giving me the d4 square for my knight is indeed not the most pleasant thing. On top of that we have to take into consideration that he's playing without looking at the board so removing a piece of the board can remove some of the strain.
527,15,10,Qxc6,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1pppbp/p1q3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',A small inaccuracy. I should have played bxc6 instead so that I can play d5 more easily in the future or dxc6 so that I can easily develop my light squared bishop and place my rook on d8. White now has ideas of playing Ne5 which forces Black to retreat the queen or quietly develop and target the queen more easily later on. That being said it's not a huge error. Instead of contesting the center if bxc6 was played I'll most likely start up a minority attack at the queenside. Black's structure is still very solid with little exploitable weaknesses.

The short term plan is to castle play Bb7 get my rook on f8 to b8c8 or d8 depending on the situation and then push my pawns. An unrated or 1200 elo player might give me enough time to do all that but Bert knows better then to allow me to solidify my position and start attacking plans.

Maybe it was the appropriate timing to play a move like b4 now that his knight doesn't have a lot of squares left and then play a5 after but I wanted to bring my king into safety first. In an actual game I would give a move like b4 a lot of consideration and probably even spend up to half an hour looking at it but considering we're playing on a quicker pace I played the logical O-O. I expected e5 to follow after castling but after Nd5 it doesn't look too bad for black.

The plan for White is very simple play Ng5 play e5 and because it threatens checkmate it's not possible for the knight to go anywhere but h4 where it doesn't do a whole lot but it's the only square for the knight that prevents checkmate. After that white simply plays g4 and it looks rather grim for Black. White will be up material at the cost of having an exposed king but my pieces are in no position to take advantage of an exposed king right now. It's up to me to find an appropriate defense that won't ruin my pawnstructure too much.

538,15,21,d5,b'r1b2rk1/4ppb1/p1q2n2/1ppp1PNp/7Q/2NP1R2/PPP3PP/R1B3K1 w - -',In my opinion the only correct move that Black has. Black realistically can't allow for the knight on c3 to come to e4 and pressure the knight on f6. If the knight on f6 gets traded for a piece of similar value then Black will be a pawn down after Qxh5 and that will be the least of his worries. It are moves like these that his opponents often struggle to find under time pressure which lose them the game. At the same time this is also setting up nicely for any attacking ideas on the queenside as those 4 pawns are looking really strong.

Instead he hopes to play Nf4 pressuring the h5 pawn. By making the preemptive Ne2 move he also avoids me exploiting his knight by attacking with my pawns in the near future.

The interesting part of this move is that the first instinct which is to take on c4 is most likely not the best move as after 16. dxc4 Qxc4 17. Qxc4 dxc4 18. c3/Rf1 ( either of the 2 will work imo ) Bb7 black stands fine. I'd even go as far as to say that Black stands slightly better due to the possibility of the e-pawn becoming a passed pawn the advantage in space on the queenside and the possibility of g4 becoming a very strong square for the knight on f6. Defending the f5 pawn will also make it so that White won't have too many attacking opportunities anymore giving the initiative of the attack to black. Instead White should ignore this move and probably play either Nd4 Ng3 or Nf4. Nd4 isn't too great because of the pin with Qb6. Ng3 and Nf4 accomplish the same thing namely targeting the weak h5 pawn but Black has compensation for the pawn in terms of his strong queenside and actually capturing on h5 leads to quite a few complications.

Better was Rxf5 as the bishop in this position is far too strong when it gets to g6. Most of White's attacking plans are done after I get to play Bg6 and with both my bishops aiming at his queensidestructure I'm bound to win a pawn sooner or later. If Rxf5 was played then the position was probably more or less equal after 18. Rxf5 Qb6+ 19. Kh1 Qg6 but now I think Black's position is just better. I'm pretty sure Bert would have played Rxf5 had he actually seen the position on a board but Qxh5 must have seemed a lot more threatening in his head.

White should have played Qf2 instead threatening checkmate on e1 and f1 depending on wether he moves the knight or not. The only defense to Qf2 is Nf3 after which I can freely capture his knight with his pawn with exf3 and threaten checkmate in 1 again. After that he's forced to move his bishop to d2 covering the e1 square so that Qe1 Rxe1 Rxe1 checkmate doesn't happen. After Bd2 you can either win the bishop on d2 or even better play fxg2+ after which everything just goes wrong and the position becomes near unplayable for White to a point where there's no point in playing on.

Even if you somehow manage to hold on as White then I highly doubt that you'll be winning the endgame. It was an interesting game filled with attacking possibilities. Had Bert chosen to play Rxf5 on move 18 instead then it probably would have ended in a draw. If he had had the chance to develop his dark squared bishop earlier into the game then I probably would have lost. It just confirms my suspicions that Bert even when he's not looking at the board is an opponent I can never underestimate.

However I am only familiar with the variations as white because of the fact that I was able to play the Colle System against Bert.  But I asked what would happen if white was able to play this against me.  I just didn't want to get into complications so I followed GM Susan Polgar's advise and played what I was most comfortable with.

While ...e6 makes my DSB stronger my LSB is weaker.  But I think that was the better alternative as now my DSB is blocked in making it much more difficult to get it into play and castle.

It was too soon to conclude but I thought that with this move I might have an advantage here.  But I wasn't going to count on my chickens before they hatch.  The idea being is because of what I remembered from tactical-abyss in his Q sacs (which I do intend to annotate at some point.  It would be epic because that win in regards to the same thing was someone of about his strength believe it or not.)  But the lesson was not to become overconfident and play carefully.  For now I will until I see an opportunity which is when things will go downhill.  However I should not be surprised because his c pawn had advanced first because the one thing that I forgot was that 2.c4 was played due to being a QG.

I also thought about the possibility of advancing my center with the idea of developing another piece.  But the idea behind it was to pin his N on c3.  After using analyze the board as well as visualization (which I noted in the intro) I decided that this was a bad idea.  The idea being that if I had done that with ...Bb4 he has Qa4+ after which I'd lose my DSB without compensation.
713,19,8,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Developing a central pawn and strengthening his LSB (in other words that's now his good bishop.)  The only issue is that his DSB becomes the bad bishop in return.  As white I think I would've fianchettoed my LSB in this position.  Yet he has ways to compensate.
714,19,9,Bh6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2pp1p/2p2npb/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I had a tough time deciding between this move and 5...Bg7  But given that I'd be faced with an interference (where my piece is blocked by another piece) I decided not to do that.  I have been reperimended for voluntarily blocking in my own pieces after a fianchetto.  That happened in a mentoring game with myevilluck.  And given that I remember this from over 3 years shows that near pictogram memory.  So I asked myself as Homework why have ya piece blocked in by another of mine when instead I can have it on a different flank where it's not blocked at all.
715,19,10,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2pp1p/2p2npb/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Waisting no time not only does he develop but in doing so white is strengthening his bad bishop.  That's one way I realized that he could compensate.  In addition given that he's a much stronger player I knew that he find the way to do so quickly.

Don't forget where still blending in my typical style (with the idea of making him feel comfortable and confident.  In fact I want him to do so much of it that he is taken off guard when I play something different.)  Though the plan will backfire at some point.  Now I thought that it wouldn't completely but I didn't think that the reversed would happen to me.  In addition I'm not sure what the best move was but for the reason that charleshiggie notated in a previous annotation I view it as a slight inaccuracy.  The reason being like with that game this will give white better center control with this move.
717,19,12,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2p2npb/3p4/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Once he played I realize that I had no choice but to exchange B's with this being my good bishop for his bad one.  I don't like the situation at all and asked myself if there was a better alternative.  But after further analysis I realize that there was no other alternative but to do this lest I lose a piece (which is not an option.)
718,19,13,Rxc1,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b K -',"After this however I have no problem going into an exchange.  I'm just not sure if it's quite the right choice.  Though at the time I thought it was because I remember Jack telling me that it's often a good idea to exchange often against opponents whose ratings are much strongers.  But that was before cplusplus11 said that it all depends what pieces you are exchanging and they're value compared to your value.  In it he noted ""They need to be equal exchanges. If you keep exchanging your good pieces for your opponent's bad pieces then when you offer to trade your bad piece for their good one they just decline and they win easily because they have better pieces.""  I'm afraid however that they were not equal here as I wound up giving him some of my better for his that were not as good.  "
719,19,14,Qa5+,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/q7/2PPB3/5N2/PP3PPP/2RQK2R w K -',Knowing that this is where I felt that it was safe to deviate from The General Opening Guidelines of completing development.  And yes it's also where I do things differently then what he's used to.  And in doing so I thought I had taken him offguard.  This is no cheapo tactic or attempted mate.  But what I didn't realize is that what I thought was Real Chess is actually unsound and therefore Hope Chess.  The reason I played is because of what's about to happen.  The idea being that I'm bound to win a pawn here.  In doing so however he will be able to prevent me from completing my development which I did not want.  And from there things will go downhill.  It's about pattern recognition which is my trouble spot and another reason that I do the sophisticated Homework of visualization.  But it's still a weakness which I'm bound to discover.
720,19,15,1Rc3,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/q7/2PPB3/2R2N2/PP3PPP/3QK2R b K -',This move took me surprise.  Instead I thought he'd get out of check by moving the K.  And even if one loses castling rights as I've learned there are ways to compensate.  But it would take three moves as opposed to one.  This can be done by bringing the K to e2 then the R to e1 followed by the monarch on f1.  And then it's as though you castled K side with the same results.  But this move however leaves his R pinned and I didn't think that white would want to be put in this situation.  No matter what he played I would've taken on a2.  But as noted I will up in trouble because of this.
721,19,16,1Qc1,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/8/2PPB3/2R2N2/qP3PPP/2Q1K2R b K -',I anticipated this move but only under the technicality that he is protecting b2.  However there is much more to this then meets the eye as we're about to see.  
722,19,17,1Qa5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/q7/2PPB3/2R2N2/1P3PPP/2Q1K2R w K -',Due to being a pawn down I considered other alternatives until it boiled down to two candidate moves.  They were what I play next (which I figured I'd do a move later) or 12...Bf5 with the idea of exchanging.  The reason being was to go back to development.  But it also goes with a general fact that when you're ahead it's usually to your benefit to exchange pieces.  However this is a time where visualization wasn't going to cut the mustard which is also why I use analyze the board.  And in this case that doesn't work because if I had played 12...Bf5 he would've won my Q (in return) after 13.Ra3 as it would be trapped.  This is also why he played 12.Qc1  The idea being before that had I taken (without the move played) I'd be safe.  But now after 13.Ra3 his Queen would've prevented mine from escaping because it can recapture if I took.
723,19,18,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/q7/2PPB3/2R2N2/1P3PPP/2Q2RK1 b - -',Therefore white waists no time in getting his K to safety.
724,19,19,1c5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/6p1/q1p5/2PPB3/2R2N2/1P3PPP/2Q2RK1 w - -',The plan being to exchange as his is a center pawn.  So if I could force the exchange I'd compensate for the loss of center control.
725,19,20,1Qh6,b'rnb2rk1/pp2pp1p/6pQ/q1p5/2PPB3/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',But white doesn't allow it.
726,19,21,1f6,b'rnb2rk1/pp2p2p/5ppQ/q1p5/2PPB3/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 w - -',I also considered 14...f5 with the idea of getting tempo in return.  In addition 14...Bf5 also came to mind with the idea of continuing development.  But after evaluation I realized that those were out of questions.  In fact this is indirectly forced because anything else allows 15.Ng5 in which he would mate with 16.Qxh7# which I was not going to allow.  And since I have studied a similar position with Jack Stockel (which he made do as Homework); as well as insights on tactics from GM Susan Polgar I knew what had to be done.  So this was already second nature. 
727,19,22,1Bxg6,b'rnb2rk1/pp2p2p/5pBQ/q1p5/2PP4/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',From studying TA's Q sac and a few losses prior I realized that white wouldn't just give away his B.  And if he did it would come at a price.  So asked myself if there was an alternative to this.  However there was not because had I not taken white would've mated with 16.Qxh7#  I was familiar with this kind of mate since easy19 mated me in the same way.  In return I used this same thing when mating reachforgoals (which helped me become somewhat well known for teaching chess.)  Therefore taking his B was not an option.
728,19,23,1hxg6,b'rnb2rk1/pp2p3/5ppQ/q1p5/2PP4/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Now one would think that I have a win.  But from what I noted earlier about why they give things I wasn't confident.  In fact I knew otherwise.  In other words I'm well aware of the fact that I'm big trouble and likely lost.  So I'm doing what I can to stay in and will continue putting up a fight until I'm 100% confident that it's lost.  But as we're about to see this isn't far away.
729,19,24,1Qxg6+,b'rnb2rk1/pp2p3/5pQ1/q1p5/2PP4/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',So he knabs a pawn and (in the process) places me in check.
730,19,25,1Kh8,b'rnb2r1k/pp2p3/5pQ1/q1p5/2PP4/2R2N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Forced.
731,19,26,1Re3,b'rnb2r1k/pp2p3/5pQ1/q1p5/2PP4/4RN2/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',When he played this I knew that e7 was en-prise so I asked myself what could be done to protect this.  The only choice to protect this without losing a piece was my next move.  However the game is lost either way.  But slightly better was allowing him to take because I would've lasted longer against the mate.  If 18.Rxe7 Rf7 then comes 19.Qxf7 or 19.Rxf7 and white would mate with 20.Re8# or 20.Qf8#  But with what I play next white will mate a move earlier.
732,19,27,1Re4,b'rnb2r1k/pp6/4ppQ1/q1p5/2PPR3/5N2/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',I figured out all of the facts when white moved here. At first I wasn't sure why he played this and before doing Homework the hypothesis was that he wanted my e pawn.  That however is ludicrous because after the evaluation I figured out that I'd take back.  The real reason he played this was because had his R remained on e3 white wouldn't have been able to do damage.  But with this move however it is now an official mate.  The reason being is that my K is pinned and in order to prevent it would have to escape.  Given that my monarch 19.Rh4# is inevitable.  Therefore I resigned.  What I learned is that only under certain circumstances should you deviate from the guidelines.  There are exceptions but it's important to know when they exist.  I'd say given my loss against nambam that against stronger players like bhidragon in general unless your preventing the loss of material it's not a good idea to deviate.  If it's to win a pawn the opponent might also be giving it for tactic.  In this case white did because when I captured it he prevented from not only completing development but also deploying another piece.  From there things went downhill.

A very strong player however can refute it with a king's bishop fianchetto and a pawn thrust to e5. As an opening it's a little bit  hoping the defense blitzes on first down. Works sometimes.

Black seemed to be rather aggressive with the Queen from the opening which meant that every time I threatened it Black was forced to move it away and I got a free move to increase my advantage whether it be taking an extra piece or getting an advantageous position on the board. But I also made some critical mistakes in this game mainly converting my pawn to a knight rather than a Queen which is one reason why it took so much longer to get a mate. I've played through this game again but on move 32 instead of immediately moving my pawn forward I instead did Qxa8 the move I didn't notice at first and I got mate about four moves faster depending on what Black would have done in response to my moves.

1108,31,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',His most common reply and as we're about to see he is going to get the pawn back on his next move.
1109,31,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',But that gives me time to develop a piece.  And when he takes we will go into an exchange variation.  Now I did something that cplusplus11 mentioned after what I noted about exchanging often on if it's of equal value.  In general I wouldn't be sure but in this case I think it is.  If I didn't I'd be left with an uncomfortable position because the only other choice would be 4.Ne2  And I don't like cramming my N's so I think this is the right call.
1110,31,4,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the reasons being is that his Q is out early so I'll use that time to continue with my development.  However I know that he doesn't have a weakness so caution is needed.
1111,31,5,Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',With that being said he develops another piece by pinning my N.
1112,31,6,Be2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/6b1/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I break it with the most common response.  It is worth noting that since he is a master unless I must I will not deviate from General Openings.  You've got to play it safe against someone who is much stronger.
1113,31,7,c5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/6b1/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq c6',This makes it safe for Fred to play 6...Nc6 after I castle.

I had a hard time evaluating between this move and 8.b3  I like fianchettoing but I felt that there wasn't enough time to do that.  However there was so I missed a big picture which is of bad omen.  It's worth noting that this move came before I finished my game against bhidragon and received this kind of advice.  So missing the big picture was much more problematic and I'm afraid that I did that here.  With that being said I think that better was 8.b3  This time it's not premature to say it so this move leaves me with a bad bishop since I won't be able to restrengthen it.  But with b3 I would've had a nice long diagonol for my LSB which would not be blocked in by any of my own pieces.  With that being said after the next move after which would be 9.Bb2 and I'd have a stronger then I do now.
1115,31,9,e6,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pq4/6b1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',For Fred however it's a different story as there is a place where he can place his DSB which once it does it'll be quite dangerous.  Not only that but he doesn't have a bad bishop as in this case it would be premature to think that.  His LSB has a lot of options in this position.

1117,31,11,Rd8,b'3rkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pq4/6b1/3PBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k -',Putting pressure right on the center as this is another means of controlling it.

The only problem is that my K might not be as safe.  It's hard to access it whereas before it wasn't.  This exchange involves the g pawn which is right near the K.  I used to be worried about this but feel that I'll be ok after this.  The idea being is that tactical-abyss says that just because a pawn near the K is removed (or opened up) does not necessarily mean that your K is exposed or near exposure.  I think that applies here as I still have a long ways to go whereas if it were a problem it would be game over by the 20th move at most.

Since he attacked my center by bringing his R on the d file I decide to do the same thing.  But unlike with my game against bhidragon this time I did overlook the threat.  By playing he is going to win my Q for a R on his next move.  Therefore best was 17.Ra3 and if 17...Ra8 I can get out of harms way.  But when he plays this now there will no way to protect.  With that being said the game is now lost for me.  The problem is that while thinking about the other concept I missed the big picture and patterns which is problematic.  Yet I'll still do whatever I can to stay in.  And since I'm doing as not just a WTW game but the Supplemental Talking the Talk I will not resign until he can prove a mating sequence.  And for those that are wondering this is actually my style of doing things.  In addition I have taught my students not to resign until the opponent has a mating sequence.  Now many people feel differently but reachforgoals (who I've also mentored) remembered my advice.  With that being said she played a game blundered and wound up with a lost position.  In fact she was down 10 points I think it was.  Therefore the position to many people was resignable.  Yet she stayed in and her opponent blundered which enabled her to pull a swindle and win.  I was very proud of that."

While I'm confident that it won't work against him it's still worth a try.  So the idea behind this move is to double up on one file.  Not only did a good example happen against Jack where I won his Q (and that time for free) but by allowing him to double up he enabled to pull a swindle.  But the same thing happened with tactical-abyss in his Q sac as black.  One of the ways his opponent went wrong was enabling Joe to double up on one file which did contribute his opponents downfall.

Now I considered 21.Rfd1 with the of doubling up right away.  But I wanted to win a piece so instead I'll bring the R to f7.  Now I was lost for sure but little did I realize how busted I was.  Either way Fred does have a mating sequence against which he points out.  However I still won't resign since the goal is to last at least 25 moves.
1129,31,23,Rf6,b'6k1/1p1Rb1pp/4pr2/2p2p2/2P2P2/P3Bq2/P4P1P/5RK1 w - -',"After this move however I realize that ""To take is a mistake.""  For if I do that he will mate immediately.  In fact I asked myself what I could do and only saw one move which sadly loses.  Believe it or not Fred said that I should mark down 25 moves here since it would take at least 9 moves before things would change.  But with my next move however it's lights out at once. "
1130,31,24,2h3,b'6k1/1p1Rb1pp/4pr2/2p2p2/2P2P2/P3Bq1P/P4P2/5RK1 b - -',?? Since I am busted I started moving quicker a few moves ago but this is where I rushed thinking that I had nothing else to lose.  The problem is that I did here.  That's because with this move I'm not going to last 25 moves.  Instead I had to move my Rf1 as he pointed out.  But with this move however he has a forced mate in two.  Can you see it?
1131,31,25,2Rg6+,b'6k1/1p1Rb1pp/4p1r1/2p2p2/2P2P2/P3Bq1P/P4P2/5RK1 w - -',And with that being said I resign.  That's because 23.Qh2 is forced and after that he has 23...Qg2#  So the lessons to be learned is first what was mentioned in the previous annotation which I mentioned to reachforgoals.  It is important to see the big picture.  For example my idea was to attack the center to control it.  But I overlooked my Q being en-prise and by doing so he won it for a R.  From there things were going to go downhill.  Second even when you are lost you should still take your time and concentrate.  The idea being is that in a lost position there is more to lose then one might realize.  For example had I taken more time I would've realized that moving my R off of f1 would've allowed me to play 23.Kf1 after 22...Rg6+  From there I would've lasted longer.  But by rushing I also missed the point because my monarch got confined to one square (like what we see in those endgames) and from there he was going to mate immeidately as opposed to eventually.

Still sometimes a poor move by an opponent can draw out a poor move on one's own behalf. Looking at this board with all that Qside space c4 and the beginnings of a Qside roll seems a much better double pawn movement than h4. Indeed if coupled with h3 suddenly Black's sober bishop finds it has no place to go.

By blocking off the escape square as soon as a pawn is posted on g3 that Black knight has nowhere to go. All that remains is to evaluate whether 16. g3 or 16. Qe6+ followed eventually by g3 is the better move.

Qe6+??? was TERRIBLE! 16.Qe6+?? Be7 17.g3??	Nf3+! and White has gone from ahead to firmly behind! With that issue resolved White posts its pawn on g3 and seals the knight's fate. Black will gain compensation in terms of 1 pawn and White's fortress being opened up. But the positional gain would have to be +2 for Black to break even and I don't rate it as that. Indeed the opening of the kingside will probably actually favour White in the end with perhaps that f rook set to become devastating perhaps even doubling up on the f file whilst White's pawn chain prevents Black from any counterplay on the qside. Overall it continues to amaze me how asking questions of an opponent and increasing the pressure can have such pronounced consequences in correspondence chess! When you've 7 days/move surely all pressure is an illusion all questions asked can be answered competently? Yet time and time again after solid development as soon as I build a little threat or two an opponent buckles. I think I need more games against higher opponents.

From a +2 situation Black has gone to at least a full officer down in material if I reply with the straightforward 18.Qxh4. That is my minimum gain. Now all that remains is rudimentary tactical analysis to see if the maxima and minima are the same or if there isn't an even better line for White. 18.

Then with Rf7 the most likely move it will secure the knight's retreat (unlike many a rook capture with the knight this is not a suicide mission). That will also pin the king on the back rank.

In fact this is how I would've responded because when Ron to the most common square and then Joann reattacks (forcing white's LSB to b3) she will have a pawn chain which is useful in the opening.  That is the big picture here at least in my opinion based on what I learned from Susan Polgar in a video with a very different defense however.  Nonetheless it still applies here.
1279,38,3,Na5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p7/np2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In this position black intends to trade Ron's LSB for her N.  It all has to do with good and bad bishops.  The idea being is that white's LSB is his good bishop because it's not blocked by pawns whereas his DSB is the bad bishop.  So by exchanging she's eliminating her bad bishop for the one that's worth more.  Just before this happens however white is going to do what I'd play.  And that is get his K to safety.

Ron want's to exchange pawns.  I understand that because it would generally be my goal.  But there is a bigger picture to this as Jack once said which is ""why go into complications."""

This time I have no idea why because according to tactical-abyss doubled pawns are usually of no asset unless major pieces have been exchanged.  So there's got to be a big picture that I am somehow missing.  I think that his plan was to get the N to a3 and once you exchange that piece is suddenly better place which would however make sense to me.  The idea in terms of strategy and improving your position well one step is finding a good outpost for your Knight.

Personally I like the structure better here.  That is especially because white isn't just attacking e4.  But that pressure involves a center pawn which is the big picture.
1287,38,11,1d5,b'r2qkbnr/1bp3pp/p2p1p2/3Pp3/1pP1P3/1P2BN2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Protecting his d pawn and turning what was the bad Bishop into the good one.  In doing so Ron is strengthening his position which I like.

The only issue is that with no better outposts for the N Ron's Q is sort of limited by his piece so we are experiencing a little bit of interference.  That's why I allude to when calling it an uncomfortable position.  But as we know anything can happen.

My guess seeing what happened with some of my recent losses is the threat of ...Qg4 and then follows ...Bc8 with the idea of in addition the long term plan of getting the N from g8 to g6 and possibly to h4.  So her Q LSB and N would all pose as a nasty threat.  Therefore something has to be done about the threat.

The idea being that in general when you're ahead it's to your benefit to liquidate pieces.  Therefore my hypothesis seeing what Jack taught last week is that white's Q is stronger then black's Q.

That's because after 22.Nxb4 black dare not take back because of 23.Rxa8 winning a R in which she would not be able to recapture then as that would mean losing the Q.  Instead I would've brought my R or Q to the b file.

I understand why she did this but the only problem is that Ron will get a passed pawn with his next move.  To add insult to injury it will involve a more dangerous set of pawn chains.

As Jack Stockel and GM Susan Polgar have emphasized one should bring his or her R behind a passed pawn.  That way it has protection and if you're able to promote it would at the very least mean win material.  Even if it can't Queen it makes the passer much more dangerous.

The idea is going for a swindle and hoping that white would make a mistake because doing so could in theory give the opponent a passer.  I mean as he told me in one of my previous annotations all one can do is hope the opponent will go wrong.  That was when I had two Q's against him and used that with a R to force a win.  In fact that was my first win against redfoxrising but he at one point hoped I'd go wrong which I came close to doing.  And if I did he would've mated me right away in what was a lost position.

In my opinion better was 33...Ra7 as not only can't the pawn promote (due to her N) but a4 is protected.  With this move however Joann will lose yet another pawn.

1335,39,15,2Rh6,b'2rrn1k1/4b2b/1p2p2R/3pp1p1/2pP2P1/P1P2PB1/1P2B1K1/2R5 b - -',I don't care about retaking the pawn. I have to press his K. 
1336,39,16,Bg6,b'2rrn3/4b1k1/1p2p1bR/3pp1p1/2pP2P1/P1P2PB1/1P2B1K1/7R w - -',! Very nice. If Rh8 he can move the N and exchange them and I'll be busted. 
1337,39,17,2dxe5,b'2rrn3/4b1k1/1p2p1bR/3pP1p1/2p3P1/P1P2PB1/1P2B1K1/7R b - -',Bxe5+ would have only helped him to unravel his pieces.  
1338,39,18,2Bc5,b'2rrn3/6k1/1p2p1bR/2bpP1p1/2p3P1/P1P2PB1/1P2B1K1/7R w - -',My attack is now stalled! 
1339,39,19,3f4,b'2rrn3/6k1/1p2p1bR/2bpP1p1/2p2PP1/P1P3B1/1P2B1K1/7R b - -',Well go on attacking! Nothing more left but a slow death. 
1340,39,20,3Be3,b'2rrn3/6k1/1p2p1bR/3pP1p1/2p2PP1/P1P1b1B1/1P2B1K1/7R w - -',Nice too. Black has so many moves...
1341,39,21,3f5,b'2rrn3/6k1/1p2p1bR/3pPPp1/2p3P1/P1P1b1B1/1P2B1K1/7R b - -',Open open open!

1344,39,24,3Be5+,b'2rrn3/6k1/1p2P2R/4Bbp1/2pp4/P1P1b3/1P2B1K1/7R b - -',But let's go on with some nice moves...
1345,39,25,3Rf1,b'2rrn2R/4k3/1p2P3/4Bbp1/2pp4/P1P1b3/1P2B1K1/5R2 b - -',If Kxe6 there is nothing left for white. 
1346,39,26,3Bxe6,b'2rrn2R/4k3/1p2b3/4B1p1/2pp4/P1P1b3/1P2B1K1/5R2 w - -',A little fear... and black returns the mistake losing a piece. Can you see it?

1348,39,28,Kd5,b'2rrn3/4R2R/1p6/3kB1p1/2pp4/P1P1b3/1P2B1K1/8 w - -',I can't exchange... but what else?
1349,39,29,4Bf3+,b'2rrn3/4R2R/1p6/3kB1p1/2pp4/P1P1bB2/1P4K1/8 b - -',Oh yes! This! :-)
1350,39,30,4Kc5,b'2rrn3/4R2R/1p6/2k1B1p1/2pp4/P1P1bB2/1P4K1/8 w - -',I lost here the chance to play Bxd4++ Bxd4 cxd4+. Not sure it was really good.
1351,39,31,Kxd4,b'2rrn3/4R2R/1p6/6p1/2pk4/P4B2/1P4K1/8 w - -',The only weak piece on black's side is the N but I have no chance to win it... or do I? Can you figure a plan to snap a piece here?
1352,39,32,4Bb7,b'2rrn3/1B2R2R/1p6/6p1/2pk4/P7/1P4K1/8 b - -',Let's see if black falls in the trap...
1353,39,33,4Rc5,b'3rn3/1B2R2R/1p6/2r3p1/2pk4/P7/1P4K1/8 w - -',YES! He did. Now...
1354,39,34,4Red7+,b'3rn3/1B1R3R/1p6/2r3p1/2pk4/P7/1P4K1/8 b - -',Black now has to take. 
1355,39,35,4Rxd7+,b'4n3/1B1R4/1p6/2r3p1/2pk4/P7/1P4K1/8 b - -',...and wherever the BK goes a Rcheck will win the N!
1356,39,36,4Rxe8,b'4R3/1B6/1p6/2r3p1/2p5/P7/1P1k2K1/8 b - -',Well this is blitz. You lose pieces as flys.
1357,39,37,4Rb5,b'4R3/1B6/1p6/1r4p1/2p5/P7/1P1k2K1/8 w - -',...but black is no dummy (about 1760) and attacks my pawns. From here on the game loses interest. 
1358,39,38,4Rg8,b'6R1/1B6/1p6/1r4p1/2p5/P7/1P1k2K1/8 b - -',Exchanging pawns. 
1359,39,39,4Rxg5,b'8/1B6/1p6/6R1/2p5/P7/1r1k2K1/8 b - -',?? fatal mstake!
1360,39,40,4c3,b'8/1B6/1p6/6R1/8/P1p5/1r1k2K1/8 w - -',...and black wins again despite the piece. I had to play Be4 preparing to exchang it for the pawn and... see if I can hold. 
1361,39,41,5Rd5+,b'8/1B6/1p6/3R4/8/P1p5/1r1k2K1/8 b - -',Keep checking and see how black gets out of this.

1363,39,43,Kc3,b'8/1B6/1p6/3R4/8/P1k3K1/1rp5/8 w - -',...the b3 pawn is my killer. 
1364,39,44,5Rd8,b'3R4/1B6/1p6/8/8/P1k3K1/1rp5/8 b - -',Now if BQueens I'll have to hold with Bxc2 and play again in disadvantage!
1365,39,45,5Kb3,b'3R4/1B6/1p6/8/8/Pk4K1/1rp5/8 w - -',Rd3 was the move here. 
1366,39,46,Rb3+,b'2R5/8/8/1p1B4/1k6/1r3K2/2p5/8 w - -',If BxR I'll lose the R with the c pawn and then I'll lose because my K can't reach the opposition. 
1367,39,47,Rc3,b'2R5/8/8/1p1B4/1k6/2r5/2p1K3/8 w - -',Game lost. Still interesting fight and piece snapping.
