The strategy of this opening system is becoming clearer. I’m going to attack his center from the flanks with my bishops. While playing this system (at my level of competition), I have noticed that my opponents have a tendency to push their center pawns prematurely up the board. When this happens I like to push my other center pawn up as well, locking up the center. This often gives my knights attractive squares in the center to occupy. Notice too I have not castled yet. By delaying castling my opponent will be uncertain where he should attack.

It’s not that g4 is a bad move although maybe in retrospect I’m overextending myself on the kingside while attacking on the queenside as well..... If I had to do it over again I think I would play c4 and keep my king-side pawns back for now in case I eventually did decide to castle.....After thinking about this awhile c4 was definitely the move to make, by playing g4, I chased his bishop to a square where he was attacking my e4 square (my whole strategy in this system is to over-protect this strategic square).....If I had played c4 instead, I would have been attacking his d5 square, weakening his hold on e4. The whole course of the game would have been changed. I would have expanded on the queen side instead of the other side of the board.

That being the case I move my King’s knight to g3 where it additionally provides cover for this strategically important square.

KO prefers Q-e2, a developing move. N-c4 was another possibility, increasing my presence on the queenside. One thing to keep in mind about e4, it does lock in my king’s bishop.....

This is the cost of moving too quickly and not taking all the nuances of the position in consideration. It’s not that N-f3 was an especially bad move, but I passed up other moves without even considering them.

Notice too that after about 18 moves into the game, all the pieces and even the pawns are still on the board, a demonstration of the ‘non-engagement’ character of the rat. By avoiding direct contact with the enemy in the opening, variations become less important until the middlegame and even then there is more of an on emphasis on schematic thinking, piece placement and pattern recognition…..KO preferred o-o (king safety) and N-d2 (re-positioning my own knight with an eye on the queenside). Looking back maybe N3-h4 cluttered up my kingside too much resulting in my pieces getting in each other’s way. In retrospect, I think this was the first of a series of sub-par moves on my part while my opponent was strengthening his position.....
 
Meanwhile Black moves his other knight over to f8 on the king side, to help in the defence of his king. It also now controls g6 so if I was to play h6 it would open up a hole for this knight. KO likes this move as well as the disruptive a5.

Black moves his knight on f8 to a more active position, eyeing the strategic f4 square. The intentions of his eighteenth move have now seeing the light of day, a karpovian repositioning of the knight to take advantage of some of the holes left by my advancing pawns on the kingside.

KO likes R-b1, and in lieu of what happened on the queenside in the next couple of moves, it would have been a good idea. KO also likes B-d2, giving my b4 pawn more support..…I made that queen move awful quickly. One thing I have to learn is to take more time in evaluating the position in front of me before I commit to making a move.....

Black counterattacks moving his queen’s rook to c8, threatening a pawn break at c5 disrupting my queenside. Played through a few variations and things are getting troublesome…KO pointed out that black had a number of promising replies…both c5 and a5 break up my pawn structure on the queenside and with my king sitting in the middle of the board, black is actually outflanking me.

I think black has the initiative..... KO prefers h6, still trying to stir things up on the kingside. Nxe7+ and o-o are other ideas.....
 
Black plays c5 seeking to breakthrough on the queenside. I ran through several variations and they all looked dangerous for me. I have to be careful here. If Black breaks through on the queenside I have serious problems. KO endorses c5 as best. Another possibility is N-g5, attacking my queen. Black increases his advantage with every move.

Postscript…..
 
I seemed to have lost the thread of this game around move 18 (N3-h4). Black was adjusting to the position on the board while I wasn’t. I should have paid more attention to the queenside and the safety of my king..... 
 
Frankly I move too fast and always have. By moving too quickly I often fail to understand all of the nuances of the position on the board. I also have a tendency to get so hung up on a singular idea that I fail to consider alternative moves......
 
There has been a difference of opinion on using chess engines to analyze your games. I think it depends on what engine you’re using and how you are using it. All of the engines are tactical monsters so I think you should try to analyze your games with an engine that puts more of an emphasis on positional play. Komodo has a reputation for that, so that’s the engine I settled on. I’ve read that both Shredder and Hiarcs have a strong positional bent as well. I also think you should let the engine analyze for awhile (10 minutes or more), especially for positions that have a lot of moves that rated close together). And I think you should also try to figure out why the engine settles on a particular move. This can help you learn the positional nuances that are involved in a position.......
 
I will continue to use the Rat as my opening system of choice. It did its job but I didn’t…..And congrats to my opponent, imiodrag who took his time with each move and taught me an additional lesson in patience......
 
As for Komodo 8...you can go outside now and play with Stockfish...

So, I'm used to it and as usual, we're going into the variation that he taught me which is the Open Variation.  The reason being is that he, as Homework, made me study the next move up through 5.Nc3 until it became second nature.  As he told me that this is the main variation of the Sicilian.  The approach is wrong, as the reason for this teaching is because this part of the Sicilian is the most analyzed by Masters and GM's according to him.  The truth is that it's not about what's most analyzed, but rather, what you have the most experience with.  With that being said, it works because by teaching me this line, I have the most experience.  So, when 1.e4, I have a couple of conditional moves like 1...e5 with which 2.Nf3.  But, the same is true when they play 1...c5  The difference is that the variations are a little different, but I just memorize them which isn't the best way to go since understanding is a little better.  However, it blends in with my style of play."

As I posted with what I learned from GM Susan Polgar, you should not exchange unless you have a really good reason for doing so.  What she's mainly alluding is B for N, but evaluating the N is also important.  The idea being is that with how many squares they can cover, a B is usually worth more then a N.  I felt that this was true here, so similar to what kenneth_fiore_3 I'm not going to exchange either.  I'm sure that 11.Be2 is a conditional move for the same reason that 8...Be7 was a conditional move.  He knew that I wouldn't exchange so the idea is castling, when I retreat which is what happens.

By that, he was implying what TA taught which is about N Visualization Count.  The idea is preventing the N from coming this far as once it advances far enough, it can become quite dangerous.  Well, that's the first thing that I kept in mind which is the reason behind this move.

I then told him that it wasn't this B, but rather, the other one that I wanted to exchange.  But, once he moved that, it wasn't possible.

I picked up and realized that my last move 20.b4?? was, in fact, the decisive mistake.  Instead, I should've exchanged right away with 20.Bxc4 to prevent this.  What led to this mistake was the way that I was thinking, my thought process.

Actually, what I did was take a time-out. I’ve written about this before: when I play the computer, I allow myself one chance per game to stop the clock and analyze the position on a board. I call it “Matrix chess,” because I’m like Neo in the Matrix movies, who can stop time to defeat his computer adversaries. But I can only do it once a game; that makes it a challenge to find the right high-leverage moment.
So I stopped my clock and set up a chessboard. When Daisy saw me hunched over the chessboard, she seized her opportunity to jump up on her favorite spot: my back!
So what would you play in the position above: A) exf6 (yes, it’s legal!), B) Nf3, or C) Nh3?
I was very pleased that Daisy and I not only found a good move, but we predicted the actual game variation up to move 29. Truly a successful collaboration!
First, (A) is bad. After 21. ef? now Black can take the knight without getting checkmated. After 21. … hg! 22. f7+ Kd7! (not 22. … Kd8 or … Ke7, when 23. Qf6+ wins) I was exceedingly surprised to find out that White has no good way to take advantage of Black’s seemingly exposed king. For instance, if 23. Bxg5 Bd6 24. Nf3 Qf5 and what next? Black’s pieces are all active and there are no obvious breakthroughs for White — and Black’s B and R are eyeing the h2 pawn with hostile intent.
(B) is the move I played, and you’ll see my analysis shortly.
(C) is actually the move that Rybka thinks is best! I very nearly played it. For instance, Daisy and I liked White’s position in lines such as 21. Nh3 Nxb3 22. Nf4 Qxd2? 23. Qf3! h5 24. Qxb3 Bc5+ 25. Kh1. This is the position that you see in the photograph! Black can finally castle if he wants, but he’s not likely to live very long.
Unfortunately, Black had a resource that Daisy and I couldn’t find any good answer to: 21. Nh3 Nxb3 22. Nf4 Bc5! Amazingly, Black comes out ahead in all variations, for instance 23. Nxd3 Bxf2+ 24. Rxf2 Nxa1. White can trap the knight in the corner with 25. Ne1, but it takes too long to bring the rook to a square where it can attack the knight, and meanwhile Black can rescue it with … a5, … a4, … Nb3.
This was such a bummer that Daisy and I gave up on 21. Nh3 altogether. But in fact, Rybka says that White gets a comfortable advantage after 21. Nh3! Nxb3 22. Nxb3 Qxb3 23. Nf4 Qxc4. I think that we underestimated this because we saw White sacrificing two pawns for nebulous counterplay. But actually, Rybka says it’s overwhelming after 24. Rc1 Qb3 25. Qe2!, threatening Qh5+. There are too many leaks in Black’s position, he can’t cover them all.
There’s a great lesson here, which is that if you’ve sacrificed a pawn for some counterplay, you can often get overwhelming counterplay by sacrificing a second pawn. Daisy and I were not quite ambitious enough.
However, in variation (B) we found a really nice, "
399,14,9,Nxb3,b'r3kb1r/ppp5/1n2p2p/4Pp2/2P4B/Pn1q1N2/3N1QPP/R4RK1 w kq -',"? Too greedy. According to Rybka, Black should hold White to a slight advantage with 21. … Rg8."

Basically I have to play for either a checkmate or a major win of material. Fortunately, the queen, bishop and knight are an extremely effective attacking force and Black’s king is far from the rest of his army. For those reasons the position more or less played itself from here."

What a fun game this was! We had an innovative opening; an exciting middlegame with a pawn sac, a knight sac, an exchange sac, a rook sac, and a queen sac (although Black had to decline most of the sacrifices); and a complex endgame culminating in a king hunt and a checkmate.

So the main reason why white lost - his knight went on a little trip up the board. White should have exchanged it for the bishop and reached a level ending, but instead he tried to pull it back, and had to start surrendering material to save it. To an extent white rode his luck and black missed opportunites to win quicker, but eventually his luck ran out.

It gives him a lot of tactical options once he gets a few other pieces out.  He played well.  He scored 6.0 in Round #1 Intermediate.  Not sure how he moved up to Advanced but good on him!  As for myself, I shouldn't have lost this game.  I let him get his Q in my face and then I goofed a few tactics by not pulling the trigger quicker e.g. 22.Bg7.  Lesson learned.

This was bad psychology on two counts. First, it is in no way true that we are condemned to a ""boring"" game after 3. ... Nc6. Things can get very interesting after 4. Bb5 Nd4, the Rubinstein Variation. Second, playing a move that you have never played or studied, against a very seasoned master, is a recipe for disaster.

People who enjoy defending a long time in order to win in the endgame should like that variation; I probably wouldn't enjoy it."

Nxb4 Black's loose bishop drops off. After 6. ... Qe6 7. Nxc7+ the queen is gone. On ""normal"" moves, White wins a piece (or so I thought) on b4. I was looking at the cheerless prospect of getting maybe one pawn at most for a piece, and playing on for 30 more moves against a master whose forte was steady, rock-solid chess. No thanks, I thought. Therefore: It was only several days later that I realized that Black doesn't lose a piece. At most, I might have to give up a pawn, and that is hardly worth resigning over. The key point is that after 6. ... Qd6! 7. N5xb4 a5, the b4 knight has no flight squares. If 8. Qe2 Kd8! White can't take on e4 because 9. Qxe4?? Re8! wins the queen.
Somewhat better for White is 6. ... Qd6 7. N3xb4, but he still can't hold onto both knights after 7. ... c6. My post-game analysis went 8. Nc3 Qxb4 9. Qg4 with advantage to White, but in the one game on ChessBase where this actually occurred, White's advantage is quite minimal. Elizabeth Paehtz versus Thomas Pattard, Dresden 2002, went 9. ... O-O 10. Qxe4 Qxe4+ 11. Nxe4 Re8 12. d3 d5 13. Be2 de 14. de Rxe4 15. Be3  White has an advantage thanks to the two bishops and she eventually won, but I think that was in part due to being a better player than her opponent (rated 2320 versus 2195). Certainly if I had been told on move 6 that I could reach this position as Black, I would have been thrilled!

The computer (Rybka) says that White should have played 8. Ne3! rather than 8. Nc3 and this leads to a rather large advantage, because in the variation above a knight on e3 would have been able to jump to f5, creating a mate threat on g7. But here we are starting to get into computer versus human play. Would Blohm have been able to see 8. Ne3 and understand why it was better? A strong 2300 player like Paehtz didn't. Certainly it would have been worth playing on to find instead of resigning on move 6."

On the one hand you feel a lot of pressure to win, because you almost werewinning. On the other hand, there is no way to directly convert that clock advantage into a chess advantage.

As for Mike, he said that his intention was to “play a dozen moves and offer him a draw.” And in fact, that’s what he did. Wang, to his very great credit, refused the offer. If he was going to win the club championship, he was going to do it by beating the five-time champion, not by taking a draw offer before the fighting really began. But this, too, might have put some pressure on Wang; when you turn down a draw, you then feel as if you have to justify doing so."

The position indeed looks very dangerous for Black, as all of his pieces are in a clump on the queenside, while his kingside is defended only by a solitary bishop. When Mike showed this game at his chess party last week, I think that everyone who hadn’t seen it expected that it would end with a powerful kingside attack for White.
But that’s not what happened. Somehow or other the young upstart managed to distract White’s attention from the kingside. It starts with a very nice positional pawn sacrifice."

With 19. … c4, Black is trying to take control over the narrative, to make it be about his pieces and not Mike’s. If Mike accepts the pawn with 20. bc, then Black gets terrific compensation after 20. … Na4 21. Bd4 Nxd4 22. Nxd4 bc 23. Nxc4 Nc3! Already Black has a serious threat to sacrifice the exchange on d4 and play … Qc6, threatening mate on the long diagonal. Though White can defend this, he is forced to retreat, and the position will become one where Black’s pieces control the board and dictate the action.
So Mike turns down the offer and tries to keep the initiative on side. But his young opponent will not be denied."

White wants to keep the queenside closed, because that is where Black’s pieces are massed. But on the other hand, Mike is giving away a pawn. In reality he had committed himself to sacrificing the e5-pawn as soon as he played 22. c3.
Mike’s comment on this move at the chess party was totally characteristic of him. Why did he play this move? “I’m winning the endgame!” he said.

On the one hand, this is totally nuts. Black has lots of chances after this to equalize or even stand better. On the other hand, it’s so Mike. Remember the Mike Splane question: “How am I going to win this game?” He asks it in almost every game, whether his position is better or worse. Here, how he is going to win the game is very simple. He’s going to win Black’s two weak queenside pawns, at c4 and a6, and then he’s going to run his connected passers to paydirt.
The deeper lesson here is that the “objective evaluation” or “computer evaluation” doesn’t always matter in a contest between humans. If you have a plan and your opponent doesn’t, you’re winning.
Also it doesn’t hurt to have a ghost named George helping you!"

We have all been conditioned by experience to put the bishop on g7, because we have seen so many thousands of fianchettoed bishops. By contrast, the bishop on f6 looks a little bit loose and strange. But you have to play the concrete position in front of you. The point of 27. … Bf6 is to throw a monkey wrench into White’s plans on the kingside. If 28. Ng5 Black can play 28. … Bxg5 29.

This is the point at which, if I were playing Black, I would say “Oh-oh.” There are so many weak spots in Black’s position, and they all seem to have pawns on them: a6, c4, e6, f7, g6. Black could play 29. … Ra8, but it’s a cheerless defensive move. Rybka likes 29. … Bf6 best in spite of the loss of tempo, but Black is scarcely likely to play that after turning it down a move earlier. I think that the move Wang chose is right on principle.

I mean, what could be more natural than putting both rooks Benko Gambit-style on the files where White has “hanging pawns”?

It was only when the computer voiced its strong preference for 33. … Rb6! that I started looking more carefully at this move. With 33. … Rc8 you are taking a rook that is already in a perfect, active position and spending a tempo to move it to a less active position. That might sound surprising to you because the rook looks active on c8. But you have to consider the concrete position. White’s plan is to move his knight to e4 and then c5, and at that point Black’s so-called active rook will be biting on granite. Anyway, in general, you should always question how “active” a rook really is when it’s in front of a passed pawn. Repeat after me: rooks belong behind passed pawns.
A line that really shows the difference between 33. … Rb6 and 33. … Rc8 arises if White tries to play the same way he did in the game: 33. … Rb6 34. Ne4 Ne5 35. Nc5 Nc4! For 13 moves the bishop on b2 has been the secret Achilles’ heel in White’s position, and now it starts to hurt. White cannot grab the pawn with 36.

As after the chess club ends and I am done with work, I have to get ready for work the next day.  Then, I have to do most of my packing the following day because I'm scheduled to work that Monday which is October 16th.  Then, I leave the next day and must have almost all of my packing by the 17th because I must leave a few hours early to get across customs.  And, that's combined with the fact that at an earlier time on that Tuesday, I take care of business before catching up from what I missed of, ""The Voice"" from the previous night since I had to work.  So, a lot is going on.  It's just too much to keep with at once and does have some effects on my play, as it did here."

As he'll recapture with the Knight which doesn't favor white because, aside from the loss of castling, I wasn't going to exchange for any other reason.  So, I misjudged this.

What I kept in mind here was a game that GM Susan Polgar at, ""Polgar Chess University 2017"".  It was a similar situation to what happened here where Susan threatened a N fork between the R and Q.  The opponent figured out what she was threatening and defended it.  However, he, forgot about the threat later on and removed the guardian.  In doing so, he allowed Susan to win the exchange being a R for her B, and that was losing blunder as it only went downhill from there.  Knowing that, I, similarly, grabbed the N right away.  "

As I would've answered with 14.Re1  Forget about centralizing the R.  Instead, this would've pinned his N in the same way.  Now, his only option would be 14...f6 which, of course exposes K.

Obviously, 15...g6 would lose more material because 16.Rxe5  You might think that black could simply recapture with 16...fxe5??. but 17.Qxf5 would win a pawn and win the R back by forking on e8 and a8.

I didn't look into the variations and just thought that black would win the pawn back.  But, this pin was enough under the technicality that Ted had to leave early.  In fact, this is when he had to do it because he had an appointment.  Being a piece down, he resigned.  Had he not resigned, I would've called this game unfinished by recording as in progress since it would've timed out.  But, Ted wasn't going to play on.  Contrary to what I said in Bonnie's last annotation, though, I would not have resigned here.  In the last one, her opponent was behind but by the equivalent to a R with which there was nothing else to learn.  But, there is still something to learn being a minor piece down.  But, he went wrong by removing the guardian as the pawn protected his N on the d file.  Attacking my Queen with that pawn is what lost it.

First, Ubilava offered and continues to offer Mike many opportunities to take on f6 and double Black's f-pawns. White is never interested in doing this because he wants to keep the advantage of the two bishops, and he does not want to be stuck in a position where he has a bad bishop and absolutely no dynamic possibilities. One of the big strategic themes in this game will be the battle between the two bishops and the two knights, and the struggle by each side to obtain a position that is better for his minor pieces.
Second, I believe that this is the point where Black starts going wrong. Up to here, I think that Black definitely has a more comfortable position. Somehow, over the next 15 moves, the position changes to one where White is in complete control. Black must have made a mistake -- and yet there is not a single move you can point to and say, ""This is a mistake."" Instead of annotating moves we have to annotate ideas.
I believe that the correct idea for Black in this position is to try to win White's front c-pawn, because Black can attack it three times and White can only defend it twice. This is a common theme in, for example, the Saemisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. I would start here with first 14. ... Ne6. This is useful already; it puts the question to the bishop. Are you going to e3 or h4? If 15. Bh4, then I think Black has a good opportunity to shift his attention to the kingside with 15. ... Nf4, which I think forces the retreat 16. Bf1. White's pieces are looking very disorganized. On the other hand, if 14. ... Ne6 15. Be3, then I think Black's plan is (in some order) ... b6, ... Ba6, ... Ne8, ... f6, ... Nd6, ... Nc5, ... Nb7, ... c5, ... Na5. Maybe this will not be possible to execute completely, but at least the ... Nf6-e8-d6 maneuver is, I think, a very good way to strengthen Black's position.
By contrast, in the game Black's knight has trouble finding a useful square. It ends up going from f6 to h5 to g7, where it is pathetically placed. As Jesse Kraai likes to say, ""Find your worst piece and make it better."" I think it takes a certain amount of insight to realize that the knight on f6 is actually Black's worst minor piece.
Here is how the game turned around:"

I've said that there were no tactics in this game, but this was Ubilava's one chance to tactically transform the position with a piece sacrifice: 15. ... Ncxe4!? 16. fe Nxe4. It looks to me as if Black either wins two pawns, emerging with four pawns for a piece, or he wins the exchange, leading to a R+2P versus B+N situation. Curiously, Mike didn't mention this possibility at all when we were going over the game, so I don't know what his intention was.
As for Ubilava, I think that he was not interested in this variation because he intends to play a maneuvering game. This gives some valuable insight into grandmaster psychology. This may not be true for all grandmasters, but I think that most of them, when playing an amateur or in this case a low 2200 player, would rather turn the game into a soccer game that they win 1-0 than play a basketball game and win 101-99. There is less of a chance for things to go wrong. It doesn't mean that Ubilava will avoid tactics, but he will go into tactics only if they lead to a clear advantage."

The text move leads to a middlegame with two knights against two bishops. This is always an interesting battle, and in many cases I would prefer to have two knights against two bishops than to have a knight and a bishop against two bishops. The reason is that the pieces have such different abilities. When you have B+N versus 2B, very often the knight is simply inferior. But when you have 2N versus 2B, the knights work together in ways that bishops can't duplicate. It becomes a more unbalanced game, with chances for both players.
It's fascinating to see how Ubilava makes the most of his position, essentially by contracting it. He cedes the edges of the board to Mike and consolidates his forces to the 6-by-6 square in the middle, where he hopes the battle will be fought. In close combat, the knights will be stronger than the bishops. I've never seen a strategy quite like this before."
1175,39,9,2gxf5,b'4r3/1pk3n1/2p2p1p/r1n1pPp1/p1P1P3/2P2P2/P2RBB1P/2KR4 b - -',"In our analysis session Mike criticized this move, but I don't see why. It's automatic and it's fine."
1176,39,10,c5,b'7R/2knr3/1p1n1p2/r1p1pPp1/p1P1P3/2P2P2/P3BB2/2K4R w - -',"Around this time Mike's game was starting to attract a lot of attention from the other players. Here's an unknown American who has hardly played in 20 years, with what appears to be an absolutely crushing position against one of Spain's leading grandmasters. However, looks can be deceiving, and this position definitely is.
As Mike said in showing us the game, one thing that Ubilava did brilliantly in this game was putting his pieces where they can't be attacked (an idea Mike attributed to Gligoric). In particular, Black's knight on d7 holds everything together and Mike has no way to get at it.
Also, another thing you have to ask in any position is: Where are the pawn breaks? Mike has none. So he has no way to ""soften up"" or create weaknesses in Black's position. It's far from clear how he can make progress. Mike quoted some other chess author (alas, I don't remember who): ""No pawn levers, no plan.""
But I think White does have a plan! It's one of the most brazen plans in chess, and you can use it only in a position where your opponent has absolutely zero counterplay. I call it the Long March: moving your king from one side of the board to the other.
In this position, what I want to play as White is 31. Kg6. But I'm not allowed to do it in one move, so instead I do the Long March: Kc1-d2-e1-f2 (obviously, the bishop needs to move out of the way at some point) -g3-g4-h5-g6. Once I have gotten my king there, I can play Rh7, trade a pair of rooks, and I will then be ready to sacrifice at d7, f6, or g5. Any of these will be deadly, because the king is like an extra piece, ready to vacuum up Black's pawns and usher the f-pawn home.
There is another terrific thing about a Long March: it saves you vast quantities of time on the clock. This game was played at the standard FIDE time control, with a 30-second increment. For eight moves you can take just five seconds a move and put a lot of time back on your clock.
The big question, of course, is whether Black is truly devoid of counterplay or whether he can short-circuit the Long March with a timely ... b5. My hunch is that this move is not so terrifying for White. White simply takes on b5, puts his bishop on c4 (where it now becomes a useful attacker) and lets Black take the c3 pawn if he wants.
When I asked Mike if he had considered moving his king to g6, he looked at me in shock, and said, ""I never once thought about it, during the game, or going over the game later. Not until you just asked me the question.""
What happened, as you'll see, was that Mike kept his king on the queenside, and even made an ill-conceived feint toward the a4-pawn. When Black finally did play the break ... b5, instead of being safe on the kingside Mike's king was caught in the crossfire, and that is how he eventually lost."
1177,39,11,3Rg8,b'6R1/2knr3/1p1n1p2/r1p1pPp1/p1P1P3/2P2P2/P3BB2/2K4R b - -',"In spite of my comments above, you can't call this a mistake. It looks awesome: doubling rooks on the eighth rank! Against a grandmaster! Mike said that he was starting to get a surge of adrenaline. ""I might actually beat this guy!"""
1178,39,12,Rb7,b'6RR/1rkn1r2/1p1n1p2/2p1pPp1/p1P1P3/2PB1P2/P4B2/2K5 w - -',"!! This is a real grandmaster move. To me, it's the star move of the game, and the reason Ubilava was able to save his position. Ubilava tells Mike, ""Go ahead and take the a-pawn. I don't care.""
Indeed, after 34. Ra8 Rb8 35. Rxb8 Nxb8 36. Rxa4 Kb7! the rook might end up stuck on the a-file. For example, if 37. Ra3 Nc6 38. Rb3 Na5 39. Rb1 Kc6, Black can win the c4 pawn any time he wants, and Black can also take over the h-file any time he wants.
There's another important thing that Ubilava had to see (at least, I hope he saw it). A much more dangerous idea for White is to play 34. Bc2! and go after the a-pawn with the bishop. Of course it looks as if this move hangs the c-pawn, but Black has to realize that the pawn is poisoned. After 34. Bc2! Nxc4? 35. Rc8+! White's doubled rooks turn into savage beasts. After 35. ... Kd6, 36. Bxa4 doesn't just win the a-pawn, it threatens mate in two! Black's most natural response is 36. ... b5? (better is 36. ... Rc7, but it's still bad) and now we play the murderous 37. Rhd8! and Black can resign. The threat is 38. Bxc5 mate, and if 37. ... Ke7 than 38. Re8+ also leads to mate.
Isn't it incredible how quickly the position shifted from strategy to tactics? But that's the way that chess works. The strategic advantage of doubled rooks on the eighth is only good if you use it for something -- and in particular, rooks like this are very good at creating mating nets.
However, Ubilava surely saw all of that, and after 34. Bc2! he would not have been suckered into taking the worthless pawn on c4. Instead he would have continued the plan initiated by his previous move: 34. ... Rb8! I've looked and looked at this, and I can't find any advantage for White. If 35. Rxb8 Nxb8 36. Bxa4, Black imperturbably plays 36. ... g4!and White's pawn formation on the kingside starts to collapse. Alternatively, if White opts to keep rooks on and play 34. Bc2! Rb8! 35. Bxa4 right away, then 35. ... Rxg8 36. Rxg8 Rh7! threatens to invade on the h-file, and White's bishops are very poorly placed to defend.
Instead Mike moved a different piece to c2, one that was even more ineffective."

Even though Mike lost, I think it is a privilege to get a chance to play a game like this against a grandmaster. You get a chance to see how they think and how they play when their backs are against the wall.
To Ubilava's credit, when they went over the game he did not try to pretend that his mishandling of the position from moves 14-23 was part of some brilliant, genius plan. He said to Mike simply, ""You outplayed me."" How often do you hear a player who is rated 300 points above his opponent admit, ""You outplayed me""?  Not very often! I think that shows great sportsmanship and humility by Ubilava."
