What I should have done is looked at how weak my pawns were and kept the pressure on while I improved the position by swapping some of them off. White is very tied down by the need to defend the g2 square and by advancing the h pawn I could have brought the rooks into play. h5 Rf7 Ng6 would have been better and thye queen swap would have been much better if the g4 square was not avaialble to the knight

The bishop is good for defending pawns but not much good for attacking as the two rooks and queen can always protect any white square. I was still trying to win and was after the f pawn but miscalculated

249,10,23,Qb6,b'6k1/p4pp1/1qQn3p/8/2p5/P3PN1P/5PPK/8 w - -',exchanging the queens here is good for black. the b and c pawns are going to be connected and the black knight will help the promotion. for example 25.Qxb6 axb6 36. Ne1 b5 37. Kg1 c3 38. Kf1 Nc4
250,10,24,3Qa8+,b'Q5k1/p4pp1/1q1n3p/8/2p5/P3PN1P/5PPK/8 b - -',avoiding the exchange and pushing the king away from the center.

255,10,29,4Qxd6,b'7k/p4pp1/3Q3p/8/8/P1p1P2P/1qN2PPK/8 b - -',In my opinion the most important decision in the game for white. At first glance it seems a bit terrifying letting the queen take on c2 since its only two steps away from promoting his pawn. However white bets on harassing the black king with checks that he cannot avoid. Another option was Nb4. For example 41.Nb4 Qd2 42. Nd3 Ne8 but this seemed to me to complicate things more for white. This was a delicate situation and the simpler things were the better for me.
256,10,30,Qd3,b'8/p4Qpk/7p/8/8/P1pqP2P/5PPK/8 w - -',Holding the checking squares and trying to push the pawn. White is a pawn up but that is meaningless here. First priority is to stop that pawn!

260,10,34,Qc8,b'2q5/p6k/6p1/7p/P7/2p1P1PP/Q4PK1/8 w - -',Here the draw was agreed. Qa8+ doesnt change anything and black cant stop the checks and advance the pawn at the same time. If for examples tries to move the king instead for example 53...Kg7 then 54.Qc4 threatening the pawn again and blacks play becomes passive. So here black had the advantage with the passed c-pawn but somehow white found all the resources to stop it and take the draw. Perhaps trading the first rook was a bit of an inaccuracy but im not really sure. Maybe black should hold off the exchanges and try for a more dynamic middle game where he could create weaknesses as i was trying to defend the pawn from advancing!

The g pawn is en prise but Freddy did not wish to take it because he was a little worried by a move such as Rg8.  He wanted to castle short and he did not want any open lines to his king!  A nice feeling that I have actually done something to worry the Master Mater!

Black gets a more compact pawn formation in the center safeguards for instance the d5 square against it's possible occupation as an advanced post by a White Knight; but the a-pawn is isolated and more over as in the game the c5-square may become a weak point.

The latter would be inelastic and its range of action small at best as far as g4-square (should white play g4 to attack opposing pawn minority) while it would also be more attackable e.g. by a Knight at c5which could not the driven off. On the other hand a Knight at e6 would be not only an excellent - because unassailable - blockader but also a very aggressive oneamong other things preparing the way for g5. It is often the greatest importance to find the right blockading piece.

White should seek to keep the Knight as a potential blockader or at any rate only exchange him for a Knight. The situation is this: the two Knights are here the chief actors (because the most effective in blockade) and whoever gives up his proud horseman for a prelate gets in this case the worst of the bargain. 17.

A comparison between the two blockading pieces the Black Knight at e6 and the White Bishop at c5 is here all in favour of the Knight. The Bishop it is true does his work as a blockader pure and simple well enough but otherwise his effective range of action is very small.

White made a slight inaccuracy in the opening and though Black (me) did not find the most accurate continuation right away I was able to pose some concrete problems that my opponent failed to meet actively and energetically enough.

I chose 4. …Nf6 because in my opinion it gives Black good chances to complicate the game and outplay the opponent."

White secures the center pawn but what he really needs to do now is develop and get the King out of the center. To this end Bd3 is the normal move while Qd4!? is also logical.
7. f3 seems to secure the center for good but in fact the e-pawn is going to be gone in a few moves after which White will be behind in development and having the pawn on f3 will just leave a weakness on the kingside."

Black has better development and central control while White has both Kingside and Queenside weaknesses and lacks a safe place to put the King. 
By failing to make this exchange now Black allows White a chance to get the King out of the center right away and avoid the grim fate described above. 
The pawn sacrifice with …0-0!? was also interesting and deserved consideration."
332,14,9,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b6/2N2P2/PPPB2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"? This moment is the critical point that decides the course of the entire rest of the game. White misses his last chance to safeguard the King and equalize. 
This is a very instructive psychological error. 9. Bd2 seems like an entirely natural and logical move: it develops and breaks the pin on the Knight. The problem with this line of thinking is that it misses the urgency of the situation: White's position is extremely perilous and requires radical action. The White king is sitting on an open e-file and needs either three moves to castle safely on the Queenside or else two moves to run to the dubious shelter of an airy (remember 7. f3?) Kingside. True Black has no immediate threats against the King but that does not matter: if the White King does not make it out of the center safely Black can take all the time he needs setting up threats against a sitting-duck target. Thus urgent tactical means are necessary to get the King to safety NOW: 9. Qe2+! Qe7 (forced: …Be6? loses to 10. Qb5+! winning the Bishop – this is why Black should have traded last move) 10. Bd2 and White can castle safely next move. With the King castled and the Queenside pawns intact White is out of danger.
After the text Black is able to keep the White King in the center long enough to build up a crushing attack. Not realizing the danger of the situation White did not look for an antidote: as a lesson to all players it is hard to find a solution to your problems if you don't know that they're there!"

White's extra pawn and more forward development is i think equalled by blacks potentially huge firepower down the centre. the queen's lack of flight squares could be a problem.

however it overlooks the fact that the e6 square is now a serious hole in blacks own position.

I was expecting Bc8 - comanding a potentially important diagonal and perhaps getting ready for a pawn exchange on e5 or to protect an adfance on f5? the problem is that white still has a pawn centre in this case whereas black doesn't really."

477,21,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Preparation for d5.

480,21,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/2P1P3/P4P2/1P1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The move is ready now as the pawn is being attacked twice and defended three times.
481,21,5,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp3/3PP3/P4P2/1P4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',An interesting position. I have three options here. 6...Nxe4 7. fxe4 dxe4 leaves me behind slightly in material but with a passed pawn. However at this stage of the game a passed pawn isn't worth too much. 6...exd4 7.Qxd4 is bad I have an isolated d pawn I can't support. If I take dxe4 then after 8.Qxd8 Kxd8 I've lost the right to castle and have a bad king position. If I play 6..dxe4 then it gets interesting. If 7. fxe4 Nxe4 then I'm up a pawn and have a knight trained on f2 and after playing Qf6 or Qh4 I have a mating threat. On the other hand if he plays 7.dxe5...
482,21,6,Qa5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/q3P3/4p3/P4P2/1P4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Another possibility was QxQ forcing him to retake with his king and losing the opportunity to castle. However this move puts him in check and lets me retake on e5. Plus if he plays b4 instead of Bd2 I can play Bb4+ and axb would be met with QxR.
483,21,7,Qxe5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/4q3/4p3/P4P2/1P1B2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Puts me a pawn ahead gets my queen and knight out of danger and threatens the ungarded b2 pawn and the rook behind it. Plus it also threatens exf3+ which is huge trouble for white. At best he loses his queen (10. Qe2 fxe2) or a rook while I promote (10. Be2 fxg2 and then fxh1 with a promotion cannot be avoided.) while at worst he can get mated. (10.Kf2 Bc5 11. Kf3 Bg4# or 11.Bd3 Qd3 12. Kg3 Bd6 13. Kh4 g5#)
484,21,8,f4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/4q3/4pP2/P7/1P1B2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Although this ruins the possibility of exf3+ I can still take the b pawn and attack the queenside rook. Still with 10. Nb3 or Bb3 I can't quite take it. Not yet. Still I'm disrupting his position and building a lead in pawns which can prove quite decisive in endgame. 
485,21,9,1Bb5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1B6/4pP2/P7/1q1B2PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',This was definitely a mistake. As it is although I can't take the rook I do get some free material out of that bishop.
486,21,10,1Qxb5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1q6/4pP2/P7/3B2PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',At this point I'm two pawns and a bishop ahead in material I have two pieces developed to his one and I have a passed pawn. Meanwhile his position is in shambles due to a badly guarded king and lack of offense. 
487,21,11,1Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1q6/4pP2/P1N5/3B2PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Good move. It develops a piece gains a tempo by attacking my queen and his rook and queen are now guarding each other.
488,21,12,1Qc6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2q2n2/8/4pP2/P1N5/3B2PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',This one gets my queen out of danger and gives a natural followup e3. If white doesn't take precautions I can get a double attack of Qxg2 (which makes Qxh1 unavoidable) and exd2. However both are foiled by Qe2 as it pins the e pawn to my king whilst defending the g pawn. So I need additional preparation first.
489,21,13,Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2q2n2/8/4pPb1/P1N5/3BQ1PP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Thanks to the protection from my knight on f6 e3 is almost ready if he plays Qe3 I can counter with Bb5 which will drive the queen away.
490,21,14,Bd4,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2q2n2/8/3bpPb1/P1N3Q1/3B2PP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Now I add a new threat to the equation pinning his knight against the rook. When I play e3 although Qxg2 is no longer a good idea If he moves his bishop I can play Bxc3 forking his king and rook. If he doesn't I just play exd2 and follow up with Bxc3.
491,21,15,1Rc1,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2q2n2/8/3bpPb1/P1N3Q1/3B2PP/2R1K1NR b Kkq -',Unpins and defends the knight but it doesn't matter as the time is ripe.

493,21,17,1Bxc3+,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2q2n2/8/5Pb1/P1b1B1Q1/6PP/2R1K1NR w Kkq -',Here I have all sorts of fun opportunities. If he playes 17. Rxc3 I just retake with my queen whilst if he attempts defense with the bishop then after 17.Bd2 Ne4 18.Rxc3 Nxg3 19.Rxc6 Nxh1 I've won a rook outright. If he tries playing 17.Kf1 then after 17...Qc4 18.Ne2 Qxe2+ 19.Kg1 he's trapped in the corner yet another piece down. (And not 18.Kf2 because of Ne4#. If 17.Kf2 then Ne4 forks the king and queen). 
494,21,18,Qxc3+,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/5n2/8/5Pb1/P1q1B1Q1/6PP/4K1NR w Kkq -',There are several lines from here all of which are highly in my favor. Either 18.Kf2 Ne4+ 19.Kf1 Qd3+ 20.Ke1 Qd1# (or 20. Ne2 Qxe2+ 21.Kg1 Qd1+ 22.Qe1 Qxe1#) 18. Bd2 Qa1 19. Kf2 Ne4+ 20.Ke3 Nxg3 (19.Bc1 would delay it one more move but only changes Ne4 from check to checkmate.) 18. Kf1 Qd3+ 19. Ke1 Qd1+ 20.Kf2 Ne4# (or 19. Kf2 Ne4+ 20. Ke1 Qd1#) or 18.Kf1 Qd3+ 19. Ne2 Qxe2+ 20. Kg1 Qd1+ 21.Qe1 Qxe1#.

At the same time White is ahead in development and has the f-pawns as a target. Black's Bishop pair is unlikely to be of much use in this closed position but on the other hand White has blocked the c-pawn and so the usual c4 pawn break will be harder to organize than usual. White's plan at its simplest is to play Bd3 Qf3 and Nge2 to pressure the f-pawns and then to further weaken them with either h3-g4 or h4-h5. This plan does not pan out so well in this game so an example of how powerful it can be seems in order: Browne vs R. Byrne 1977 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1333279) was the game that first persuaded me to give this variation a try.

I really liked this move at the time since it prevents …Nb4 in order to preserve my Bishop and (I thought) deprive the Knight of any future. As the Knight is headed to e7 anyway the latter point is simply not true. As for the former I am not sure that there is anything wrong with allowing …Nb4 and …Nxd3. The Bishop ends up being pretty pathetic for most of the game (especially in contrast to Black's Knight) and after 8. Nge2 Nb4 9. 0-0 Nxd3 10. cxd3 I have an open c-file a possible minority attack with b4-b5 if Black plays …c6 Knights against Bishops is a closed position and support for a potential e4 push. Black would be better off continuing 8. …Ne7 as in the game.
In short with 8. a3 I weaken my Queenside to prevent a move that Black probably didn't want to make anyway.

At this point I realized that I was in real trouble on the Kingside and decided to at least get my King out of the way ASAP. White's problem is one of dynamics: although White appears to have the better pawn structure Black's pawns are in fact more dangerous for one simple reason: they can move. Black's pieces seemingly huddled in confusion on the last two ranks are in fact well placed behind the pawns to support their advance. White's pieces meanwhile however far advanced they may seem actually block White's own pawns – particularly the Nc3 inhibits the vital pawn break c4. 
0-0-0 does nothing to solve these problems – in fact it simply gets in the way of the Queen's escape route and causes a traffic jam for the retreating White pieces. Moreover the King's position on c1 makes it even harder to get c4 in. 
Much better would have been Qd1 intending to leave the King in the center retreat the f-Knight to e2 and get on with organizing c4 and Queenside play."

I was very concerned about the simple plan of playing …Nb6 and …Nc4 which would basically shut down my Queenside play before it started.

My opponent probably meant to make something of the half-open e-file once I unsupport the e-pawn with f3 but as we see in the game that doesn't work too well for him."

Black has been outplaying White for most of this game so far and though he has missed some chances he would still have a real advantage after 19. …Nb6/d6 20. Bb3 Nc4 where White has no play and Black can search for a breakthrough at his leisure. There is no good way to get control of c4 back – if Bxc4 dxc4 the pawn becomes almost as annoying as the Knight (and invincible after …Bf7) while the pawn on a3 (dammit 8. a3!!!!!!!) drops with check in case of b3 or b4. 
After 20. …Nc4 I had actually planned to play 21. b3 Nxa3+ 22. Ka2 as a pawn sacrifice choosing to go down in complications instead of being slowly crushed.

One of Black's biggest problems in this game is under-appreciating the strengths of his position. It's easy to miss chances for advantage if you assume they aren't there!

At this point I was excited to discover the line 26. Nxd5!! cxd5 27. Bxd5+ Qxd5 28. Nc7+ which seemed to win by force... except of course that 27. ...Qxd5 comes with check and therefore Nc7+ is quite illegal. Cursing my 20. Ka3 which turned Nxd5 from !! to ?? I then completely refused to learn the obvious lesson about making pointless King moves and proceeded to ""fix"" my mistake by making it all over again. 
Instead of vainly hoping that I'd get the chance to play 27. Nxd5 I should have made the best of my King's position to begin play on the a-file with a4 Ra1 and only then Kb1 if necessary. "

Right idea bad timing. ...Qb7 30. N[either]b4 Bxb4 31. Nxb4 and now White's attacking chances are much reduced.
Black does not have to allow White such dynamic possibilities as in the game. With a little patience he could have slowly forced the White pieces back and then played ...f5 at his leisure.

Some players tend to go overboard when their opponent plays something out of the ordinary trying to refute moves that they think are not in accordance to the position to the point of ruining their own position on the process. I have to confess I am guilty of this sin and have lost many a game by over-pushing and trying to castigate strange moves. 
723,32,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP1B2/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Simple development White isn't planning anything concrete with his last move so there is no point to seek adventure in lines like 3...c5 4. d5 Qb6 5. Nc3 Qxb2 6. Be5 d6 7. Rb1 Qa3 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. Bc3 Qd8 after which Black's position might seem preferable but it offers White some compensation and justifies the development of the Bishop to f4.

In what follows it's pretty hard to find a single move which is wrong by White what is revealed by his moves though is the lack of a plan of action. It takes a very active player to hold the balance in a position with an IQP (isolated Queen's pawn).

791,34,10,Re1,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',White has over-defended e4 and now is threatening to capture on e5. The pawn structure that results from this is favorable to White because he has extra space and better control of the center. Black's source of counterplay is attacking the e-pawn. But his cramped position doesn't promise much and in modern times this defense has all but subsided from practice.
792,34,11,exd4,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np1n2/1B6/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Black could have postponed surrendering the center for one more move with 7...0-0 owing to the fact that White's Re1 is overloaded but after 8. Bxc6 Bxc6 9. Qe2 exd4 10. Nxd4 Bd7 11. Bf4 White is better.
793,34,12,Nxd4,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/3p1n2/1B6/3nP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Black seizes the opportunity to exchange two minor pieces in hope that his cramped position will be less felt and his coordination won't suffer from lack of maneuvering space.

His position is passive but there are no weakness on the surface and White will have to play very purposefully in order to prove his advantage.

With a quiet Queen shuffle White has freed d4 for his Knight he's putting pressure on c7 so as to provoke c6 and a weakening of the d-pawn his Queen has the whole third rank at her disposal.
797,34,16,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/1N6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Not forced but Black isn't the strongest of players. If Capablanca were Black here I'm sure he would have seen the central strike 11...d5!. But now we are in for a treat since we are about to see one of the most beautiful examples of piece coordination ever played on a chessboard.
798,34,17,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',White has a very good position even if he has wasted a few tempos. The Knight is ready to go to f5 the Bishop has two excellent attack targets d6 and g7 the Queen will come to g3 to attack both of the aforementioned spots and the d-file will be used as well to create maximum pressure on Black's position.
799,34,18,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2pp4/8/3NP3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Black tries to use the position of White's pieces on the long diagonal to develop his Bishop with tempo on f6 supporting g7 and the Knight that is bound for e5.

809,34,28,1Rxd6,b'5rk1/ppq2ppp/2pr1b2/4nN2/4PB2/6Q1/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',The Rook had to be taken it was threatening Rxf6.

811,34,30,1Rd1,b'5rk1/ppq2ppp/2p2b2/4BN2/4P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/3rR1K1 w - -',But not this... Black had a good defensive move at his disposal 18...Qa5 and White is forced to play 19. Bc3 Bxc3 20. bxc3 Rg6 21. Ne7 Kh8 22. Nxg6 hxg6 23. Qd6 Kg8 24. Qb4 Qxb4 25. cxb4 with the better endgame.
812,34,31,1Rxd1,b'5rk1/ppq2ppp/2p2b2/4BN2/4P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Forced. Now Black thought he had time to take on e5.
813,34,32,2Nh6+,b'5rk1/ppq2ppp/2p4N/4b3/4P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',A zwischenzug that Black wasn't expecting.
814,34,33,2Qxe5,b'5r1k/ppq2ppp/2p4N/4Q3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',The second thunder-strike. A beautiful combination by Capablanca.

I had a peek through Nuntar's past game history and I spotted this little game.  This was against Coach Ion.  In this game Ion deviates from the usual Bxf7+ and plays Nxf7.  Here is how it all works out ...."

Ion is not in any hurry to take nuntar's bishop.  Methinks he does not fancy his king being stared down by nuntar's queen on the f column.

The final position is interesting.  Coach Ion is 8 points ahead on material but his queenside is undeveloped and that is after move 15.  Ion was given no time to develop anything else.  It just goes to show that sometimes grabbing copious material at the expense of developing your pieces in the opening can meet with condign punishment remember the white player is a very strong Expert and don't I know it but here he came within a whisker of copping Old Matey from a 1600+ opponent as it was he had to concede a Low Draw.  I think this is why Nxf7 is NOT played by white against the Traxler as it lead to the above scenario.  Your attack was extremely enterprising nuntar and I hope I have learned something from it.  You developed your pieces quickly and took advantage of the open lines and made multiple threats.  I take my hat off to you.  Cheers - Joanne
