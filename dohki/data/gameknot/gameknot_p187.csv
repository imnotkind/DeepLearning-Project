Black should think about something like 5. ... Na5.

It is one of the BPWUW openings (best player will usually win).  Not a lot of theoretical advantage to be gained for either side if I play 2...d5.  An opening that is NOT a BPWUW is the Rauzer Attack.  A well versed weaker player can take out a much higher rated opponent with either color.  Any of those long theoretical openings can yield positive results for the better prepared.  The Veresov might be that way but I tend to think not...
242,13,2,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',We are probably in a Nimzovitch Defense now: 1.e4 Nc6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 would be one move order besides the game's move order.  I am not a regular player of that line with either color.  I do have some books on the opening and a few more that cover some of the main lines.  Hugh Myers has the best book but to use the contents requires study and analysis to find the best lines.

White has not taken the opportunity to ruin Black's Queen side pawns but that just means the Bishop is valued more than doubled pawns.  I might have tried 12.Bc4 as an alternative to 12.f4 or 12.Bxc6.  Not playing 12.f4 allows White to attack the pawn chain with f2-f3 later.

272,14,1,Bc4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The Classical main line and one of the first historic attempts to refute the Gruenfeld. It's still seen with regular frequency in modern practice. White's idea is to place each piece on a very active and secure post while trying to maintain the central pawn duo as it is.
273,14,2,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',The standard plan for Black is to create pressure against the White centre especially the d-pawn.

He doesn't want to push either on of his central pawns and break the phalanx formation otherwise Black's pieces will just use the central squares as outposts and play around White's pawns.

278,14,7,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/4b1p1/n7/3PP3/3BBP2/P3N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A very thematic position for the Gruenfeld but one that has slowly subsided from practice because of new discoveries in the Bronstein gambit which starts with 14. d5. I'm not that concerned about it and I'm actually looking forward to playing against it provided an opponents accommodates me of course.
279,14,8,1Rc1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/4b1p1/n7/3PP3/3BBP2/P3N1PP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',An old idea White sacrifices a pawn to hold the centre. The idea is to vacate the Rook from a1 so that White can play d5 and gain space.

Rxd8 Rfxd8 has fallen out of favour since Black is the only one with real winning chances. This move tries to exploit the two Black pieces that are on the edge of the board. White definitely has pressure for the sacrificed pawn.

285,14,14,1Rc3,b'r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p4p1/n7/1Q1PP3/1bRBBP2/4N1PP/5RK1 b - -',A relatively new try and not a bad one at that. White's idea is to double Rooks and dominate the c-file. Note that because of weak white squares on the Q-side Ba6 is possible in some lines thus Black is forced to accept White's domination on the c-file.
286,14,15,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p2b1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/5RK1 w - -',Forced since White was threatening to exchange a Rook for two pieces.
287,14,16,1Rfc1,b'r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p2b1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',White managed to double with tempo and already has ideas of infiltrating Black's 7th rank.
288,14,17,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/p3ppbp/1p1qb1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',The theoretical recommendation and it served me pretty well in this game. Trying to simplify the position with 18...Rc8 19. Nf4 Qd6 20. Qxd6 exd6 21. Nxe6 Rxc3 22. Rxc3 fxe6 23. Bb5 leaves White with enough compensation for the pawn thanks to his Bishop pair and Black's weak pawn structure and bad Knight on a5.
289,14,18,1Qa4,b'r4rk1/p3ppbp/1p1qb1p1/n7/Q2PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',Avoiding the exchanges with good motive. After the Queen swap Black can contest the c-file and reduce White's compensation to zero.
290,14,19,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/p2bppbp/1p1q2p1/n7/Q2PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',No time to wait and the more pieces are exchanged the more the extra pawn will be felt.
291,14,20,2Bb5,b'r4rk1/p2bppbp/1p1q2p1/nB6/Q2PP3/2R1BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',White exchanges my white square defender but it's all in order.
292,14,21,2Bxb5,b'r4rk1/p3ppbp/1p1q2p1/nb6/Q2PP3/2R1BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',Not accepting the exchange allows Rc7 and Black will slowly suffocate.
293,14,22,a6,b'r4rk1/4ppbp/pp1q2p1/nQ6/3PP3/2R1BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',This move gives me enough time to secure the 7th rank.
294,14,23,Ra7,b'5rk1/r3ppbp/pp1q2p1/n7/Q2PP3/2R1BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',An ungainly move but necessary. If White is given time to play Rc7 d5 and Nd4 Black has no counterplay.
295,14,24,2Rc3c8,b'2R2rk1/r3ppbp/pp1q2p1/n7/Q2PP3/4BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',An interesting try and directed against my last move. White wants to reduce the scope of play of my pieces to the absolute minimum.
296,14,25,2Qd7,b'2R2rk1/r2qppbp/pp4p1/n7/Q2PP3/4BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',I in turn use White's move to force the exchange of Queens and a pair of Rooks.
297,14,26,2Rxf8+,b'5Rk1/3rppbp/pp4p1/n7/3PP3/4BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',25. d5 transposes after 25...b5. White must keep his remaining Rook active on the c-file before I play Nc4 and gain the upper-hand.
298,14,27,2d5,b'5bk1/3rpp1p/pp4p1/n2P4/4P3/4BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',Perhaps 26. Rc8 was slightly more accurate but this needs to be played eventually. White wants to use the extra space to get his pieces on ideal spots and generate more than enough initiative to recover the pawn.
299,14,28,2b5,b'5bk1/3rpp1p/p5p1/np1P4/4P3/4BP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',With the idea of Nc4.
300,14,29,2Rc8,b'2R2bk1/3rpp1p/p5p1/np1P4/4P3/4BP2/4N1PP/6K1 b - -',Absolutely forced. Now the Rook can attack the Q-side pawns from behind while at the same time keeping the Bf8 under lock and key.
301,14,30,2Nb7,b'2R2bk1/1n1rpp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/4P3/4BP2/4N1PP/6K1 w - -',Directed against White's matting net starting with Bh6. Now I could reply with Rd8 and force the exchange of Rooks. I also use the opportunity to get the Knight into play.
302,14,31,2Nd4,b'2R2bk1/1n1rpp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/3NP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 b - -',A nice and obvious move. White activates his pieces by using his space advantage.
303,14,32,2Rd8,b'2Rr1bk1/1n2pp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/3NP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 w - -',The best move. The White Rook was far too active on the last rank.
304,14,33,2Rc7,b'3r1bk1/1nR1pp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/3NP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 b - -',Keeping the Rook active is an imperative. Now the Knight is attacked and I must decide what to do about it.
305,14,34,2Na5,b'3r1bk1/2R1pp1p/p5p1/np1P4/3NP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 w - -',This looks like a step back and maybe it is. 29...Nd6 was worth considering but I was in a greedy mood.
306,14,35,3Ra7,b'3r1bk1/R3pp1p/p5p1/np1P4/3NP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 b - -',30. Nc6 is a basic draw after 30...Nxc6 31. dxc6 e5 32. Ra7 b4 33. Rxa6 b3 34. Rb6 Rc8 35. Kf1 b2 36. Rxb2 Rxc6. My opponent was trying to win this.
307,14,36,3Nc4,b'3r1bk1/R3pp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/2nNP3/4BP2/6PP/6K1 w - -',As was I. The Knight finally arrived to c4 and I can breath a sigh of relief because I have a much better chance to hold on to the extra pawn now even if that means suffering for a short time. OK maybe not a short amount of time but a pawn is a pawn and it beats suffering for nothing.
308,14,37,3Bg5,b'3r1bk1/R3pp1p/p5p1/1p1P2B1/2nNP3/5P2/6PP/6K1 b - -',White keeps playing aggressively and forcing me shut my own bishop in. The alternatives weren't much to look at however. After 31. Kf2 Rd6 32. Nc6 a6 33. Ra8 Nxe3 34. Kxe3 exd5 35. exd5 a5 36. Rb8 a4 Black has better long term prospects provided he doesn't allow any exchange of pawns which isn't an easy task by any measure.
309,14,38,3f6,b'3r1bk1/R3p2p/p4pp1/1p1P2B1/2nNP3/5P2/6PP/6K1 w - -',A double-edge move because it restricts the Bf8 further and it also weakens e-pawn and the white squares on the K-side. The main advantage of it is that is forces the White Bishop to relinquish its very active post.
310,14,39,3Bc1,b'3r1bk1/R3p2p/p4pp1/1p1P4/2nNP3/5P2/6PP/2B3K1 b - -',Probably the best place to retreat. Now the Nc4 is kept under control and I'm not allowed to develop my Bishop on the c1-h6 diagonal. After the alternative 32. Bh4 I could have played 32...b5! (giving back the pawn to activate the pieces) 33. Nxb5 Rb8 34. Nd4 Bh6! and I have a good position all of a sudden.
311,14,40,3a5,b'3r1bk1/R3p2p/5pp1/pp1P4/2nNP3/5P2/6PP/2B3K1 w - -',The a-pawn was under attack and pushing it was the only way to defended it.
312,14,41,3Rc7,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5pp1/pp1P4/2nNP3/5P2/6PP/2B3K1 b - -',A very good place to keep the Rook. White was smart to avoid restoring material balance with 33. Nxb5 because after 33...e6! the Ra7 is poorly placed and White must move to King in order to avoid an embarrassing double attack. Now I can't protect the b-pawn by advancing it because that leaves the Knight en-prise.
313,14,42,3Ne5,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5pp1/pp1Pn3/3NP3/5P2/6PP/2B3K1 w - -',Retreating the Knight from the now insecure c4 square and preparing the b4 advance in case White doesn't take on b5 at once.
314,14,43,3Kf1,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5pp1/pp1Pn3/3NP3/5P2/6PP/2B2K2 b - -',An excellent move. My opponent is avoiding all the pitfalls with great skill. The King is brought close to the centre to avoid any back rank tricks and also traps on the dark squares. But why was the very natural looking 34. Nxb5 worse than this move? The reason is that after 34...e6 White can be lured into what seems like a dangerous attack starting with 35. Nd4 exd5 36. Ne6 Bd6 37. Rg7+ Kh8 38. Bh6 Re8 39. exd5 Re7 and the attack has stalled and the a-pawn is looking like it might just queen.
315,14,44,3b4,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5pp1/p2Pn3/1p1NP3/5P2/6PP/2B2K2 w - -',The intended and best move. The pawns are pretty advanced now but they are not yet very dangerous because White with his previous move has brought an excellent piece to supervise them his King.
316,14,45,3Ke2,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5pp1/p2Pn3/1p1NP3/5P2/4K1PP/2B5 b - -',Now the pawns don't seem so menacing and White can use his active pieces to either capture them or direct his threats elsewhere.
317,14,46,3g5,b'3r1bk1/2R1p2p/5p2/p2Pn1p1/1p1NP3/5P2/4K1PP/2B5 w - -',A very ugly move but I was under the impression that f4 followed by Nc6 is very powerful. The problem is that after this move it will take extraordinary means to activate the lousy Bf8. A much better try was 35...Ra8 and after 36. f4 Nf7 37. Nc6 b3 White can choose between 38. Nxe7 Bxe7 39. Rxe7 a4 40. Ba3 Rb8 41. Bb2 a3 42. Bxa3 b2 43. Bxb2 Rxb2+ 44. Kf3 Rd2 with a very promising endgame and 38. e5 (a much better try) a4 39. Ba3 fxe5 40. fxe5 e6 41. d6 Nd8 42. Nxd8 Rxd8 43. Kd3 Rb8 with a complicated ending.
318,14,47,3Ra7,b'3r1bk1/R3p2p/5p2/p2Pn1p1/1p1NP3/5P2/4K1PP/2B5 b - -',Keeping the pressure on my pawns. The only drawback is that it allows me to activate my Rook.
319,14,48,3Rc8,b'2r2bk1/R3p2p/5p2/p2Pn1p1/1p1NP3/5P2/4K1PP/2B5 w - -',What to do with the Bishop now?
320,14,49,3Be3,b'2r2bk1/R3p2p/5p2/p2Pn1p1/1p1NP3/4BP2/4K1PP/8 b - -',An active looking move but perhaps 37. Kd1 was slightly better.
321,14,50,3Nc4,b'2r2bk1/R3p2p/5p2/p2P2p1/1pnNP3/4BP2/4K1PP/8 w - -',Now I can defend my pawns with tempo.
322,14,51,3Bf2,b'2r2bk1/R3p2p/5p2/p2P2p1/1pnNP3/5P2/4KBPP/8 b - -',Pretty forced. The active looking 38. Nc6 fails to 38...e5 39. Bf2 b3 40. Kd3 Nb2 41. Kc3 Nd1+ 42. Kxb3 Nxf2 43. Rxa5 and I'm sure I could have won this.
323,14,52,3h5,b'2r2bk1/R3p3/5p2/p2P2pp/1pnNP3/5P2/4KBPP/8 w - h6',The point to this move is to prevent White from achieving a favourable pawn structure on the K-side starting with g4.
324,14,53,3h3,b'2r2bk1/R3p3/5p2/p2P2pp/1pnNP3/5P1P/4KBP1/8 b - -',Inviting me to play 39...h4 and fix the pawn structure on the K-side but after which my Bf8 would effectively be locked in an iron cage. I had something else in mind.
325,14,54,3f5,b'2r2bk1/R3p3/8/p2P1ppp/1pnNP3/5P1P/4KBP1/8 w - -',A pawn sacrifice meant to activate my awful Bishop. Perhaps 39...h4 wasn't that bad but I had had enough of playing with only two pieces.
326,14,55,4exf5,b'2r2bk1/R3p3/8/p2P1Ppp/1pnN4/5P1P/4KBP1/8 b - -',Taking with the Knight leads to an almost forced variation after 40. Nxf5 b3 41. Bd4 a4 42. Rxa4 b2 43. Bxb2 Nxb2 44. Ra2 Rc2+ 45. Kf1 Rd2 46. Ra7 Nc4 47. Nxe7+ Bxe7 48. Rxe7 which is again a very complicated ending that both sides can try to win.
327,14,56,4Rc5,b'5bk1/R3p3/8/p1rP1Ppp/1pnN4/5P1P/4KBP1/8 w - -',Over-protecting a5 and getting rid of the White's annoying d-pawn.
328,14,57,4g4,b'5bk1/R3p3/4N3/p2r1Ppp/1pn3P1/5P1P/4KB2/8 b - g3',Fixing the pawn structure and threatening Ra8 which wasn't very good right now because of 42...Rxf5 43. Kd3 Nb2+ with an immediate draw. White is still bent on winning this. I love fighting chess.
329,14,58,4hxg4,b'5bk1/R3p3/4N3/p2r1Pp1/1pn3p1/5P1P/4KB2/8 w - -',I exchanged pawns on my weaker flank to lower White's prospects.
330,14,59,Bh6,b'6k1/R3p3/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/1pn3P1/7P/4KB2/8 w - -',An odd looking place for the Bishop but the g-pawn must not fall. I'm trying to win this too and the more natural looking 43...Ng7 would have almost forced White to draw with 44. Ra8+ Kh7 45. Nxg5+ Kh6 46. Nf7+ and so on.
331,14,60,4Bd4,b'6k1/R3p3/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/1pnB2P1/7P/4K3/8 b - -',The drawback is that White can activate his Bishop.
332,14,61,4b3,b'6k1/R3p3/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/2nB2P1/1p5P/4K3/8 w - -',Passed pawns must be pushed. I must act quick and generate enough threats before White weaves a matting net around my King.
333,14,62,4Ra8+,b'R5k1/4p3/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/2nB2P1/1p5P/4K3/8 b - -',The forceful 45. h4 trying to squeeze the mate in fails after 45...Rxd4! (eliminating White's best piece which was both attacking and defending at the same time) 46. Nxd4 b2 47. Rb7 gxh4 and there are too many runaway pawns for White to catch. The move played gives White time to bring the King closer to the connected pawns on the Q-side.
334,14,63,4Kd3,b'R7/4pk2/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/2nB2P1/1p1K3P/8/8 b - -',The Knight is threatened. Where do you think it should go?
335,14,64,4Na3,b'R7/4pk2/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/3B2P1/np1K3P/8/8 w - -',A good place where Knight is safe and is eyeing the queening square of the b-pawn. 46...Ne5+ forces White to draw after 47. Ke4 Rxd4+ 48. Kd4 b2 and White must draw with the Knight checks because Rb8 fails to Nc6+. It's very interesting that the Black King cannot come to d7 because after Rd8+ he's forced to take the forking c6 square and that gives White enough time to win the b-pawn and the game. 46...Nd6 fails to 47. Rh8 and White has enough time to capture the Bh6 and stop the pawns from advancing too far.
336,14,65,4Rb8,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/p2r1Pp1/3B2P1/np1K3P/8/8 b - -',Put your Rook behind the most advanced pawn. That isn't an empty statement and it's the best way to play against connected pawns with a Rook.
337,14,66,4a4,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/3r1Pp1/p2B2P1/np1K3P/8/8 w - -',What else?
338,14,67,4Ke4,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/3r1Pp1/p2BK1P1/np5P/8/8 b - -',The King comes into the fray.
339,14,68,4Rd7,b'1R6/3rpk2/4N2b/5Pp1/p2BK1P1/np5P/8/8 w - -',The Rook must stay on the d-file. Trying to play 48...Rb5 is thwarted by 49. Rh8! and mate is looming.
340,14,69,4h4,b'1R6/3rpk2/4N2b/5Pp1/p2BK1PP/np6/8/8 b - -',The last try for a win. Trying to play slowly with something like 49. Bb2 can only lead to a disaster after 49...Nc4 50. Rh8 Nxb2 51. Rxh6 Rd6! 52. Nxg5+ Ke8 53. Ne6 Kd7 (53...Rxe6 only leads to a draw after 54. dxe6 Kf8 55. Rh8+ Kg7 56. Ra8 a3 57. Rxa3 Nc4 58. Ra8 b2 59. Rb8 b1Q 60. Rxb1 Nd2+ 61. Kf5 Nxb1 62. g5 Nc3 63. h4 Nb5 64. h5 and White holds his ground) 54. Rh8 Rxe6! (now this works) 55. fxe6+ Kxe6 56. Rh6+ Kf7 57. Rh7+ Kg6 58. Rxe7 a3 and the Black pawns triumph.  
341,14,70,4Rxd4+,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/5Pp1/p2rK1PP/np6/8/8 w - -',The only move. This was the main reason why the Rook had to stay on the d-file. 49...gxh4 loses to 50. Bh8! followed by g5 and White's attack is very strong even with the reduced material on the board.
342,14,71,5Kxd4,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/5Pp1/p2K2PP/np6/8/8 b - -',Taking with the Knight is worse because after 50...gxh4 51. Nxb3 h3! 52. Kf3 Nc2 53. g5! (worse is 53. Nc5 Ne1+ 54. Kg3 h2 55. Kxh2 Be5+ 56. Kh3 Bxb8 57. Nxa4 and it's a simple matter of technique to win this) Bxg5 54. Nc5 a3 ( 54...h2 is met by 55. Rh8 the point behind 53. g5! the h-file is cleared with tempo) 55. Ra8 and the only one in danger of losing this is White.
343,14,72,5gxh4,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/5P2/p2K2Pp/np6/8/8 w - -',Another passed pawn is born.
344,14,73,5g5,b'1R6/4pk2/4N2b/5PP1/p2K3p/np6/8/8 b - -',If that pawn ever gets to g6 with tempo the Black King is doomed.
345,14,74,5Bg7+,b'1R6/4pkb1/4N3/5PP1/p2K3p/np6/8/8 w - -',Try to play tricky intermediate moves like 51...Nc2+ is not recommended. After 52. Ke4 Bg7 53. g6+ (remember what I said a move earlier?) Kf6 54. Nxg7 Kxg7 55. Re8! and White will deliver a Queen first despite all the passed Black pawns.
346,14,75,5Kc5,b'1R6/4pkb1/4N3/2K2PP1/p6p/np6/8/8 b - -',The King has to come forward or else my King can escape and the pawns will win. For example after 52. Kd3 h3  53. Nd8+ Ke8 54. Ne6+ Kd7 55. Rd8+ Kc6 56. f6 ( trying to close the diagonal and catch the Q-side pawns with the King) exf6 57. Kc3 fxg5+! 58. Nxg7 Nb5+ 59. Kb2 Nd6 and there are too many pawns for White to keep tabs on all of them.
347,14,76,5h3,b'1R6/4pkb1/4N3/2K2PP1/p7/np5p/8/8 w - -',A slight inaccuracy that leaves me a bit worse but not without hope. 52...Nc2 was the better move making room for the pawns to march in tandem. An interesting try is 53. g6+ Kf6 54. Nxg7 Kxg7 55. Re8! b2 56. Rxe7+ Kf6 (56...Kf8 loses outright to 57. f6 with mate to follow) 57. Rf7+ Ke5 58. Rb2 Nd4 59. Rxb2 Nxf5 60. Rf2 a3 61. Kb4 a2 61. Rxa2 Kf6 62. Ra6+ Kg7 63. Kc5 h3 and the pawnless ending is a dead draw. A very dangerous attempt is 53. Nd8+ Kg8 54. g6 Be5 55. Ra8 Kg7 56. Ne6+ Kh6 57. Rxa4 Kh5 58. g7 Bxg7 59. Nxg7+ Kg5 60. Ne6+ Kxf5 61. Nd4 Nxd4 62. Rxd4 with a draw also. The Rook can hold the pawns but it's not enough to capture them all.
348,14,77,Kg8,b'1R1N2k1/4p1b1/8/2K2PP1/p7/np5p/8/8 w - -',The only move. Ke8 doesn't work now because there is no escape through d7 anymore.
349,14,78,5Nd8+,b'1R1N4/4pkb1/8/2K2PP1/p7/np5p/8/8 b - -',Repeating the position not a problem in CC but in OTB it can have a psychological effect on your opponent who might just crack under pressure and deviate with a worse move.
350,14,79,5g6,b'1R1N2k1/4p1b1/6P1/2K2P2/p7/np5p/8/8 b - -',Threatening mate with Ne6.
351,14,80,5Be5,b'1R1N2k1/4p3/6P1/2K1bP2/p7/np5p/8/8 w - -',The only move. It prevents a very nasty discovered check it forces the Rook of the b-file or the 8th rank it makes room for the King to escape and it prepares to advance the h-pawn. Talk about doing multiple things at once. I'd just like to add a small opinion of mine. When there are advanced passed pawns on both flanks or more generally there is heavy play on both flanks a Bishop comes very close to the value of a Rook because it can focus fire defend blockade on both sides of the board and sometimes all of that at once.
352,14,81,5Ra8,b'R2N2k1/4p3/6P1/2K1bP2/p7/np5p/8/8 b - -',The only move for White as well. Playing 57. Rc8 suddenly loses after 57...Kg7 58. Ne6+ Kh6 59. Kd5 (forcing the Bishop from its over-active post in the middle of the board) Bb2! (guarding against Rc1) 60. g7 (otherwise White has to sit and what the h-pawn queening) Bxg7 61. Rc1 b2! ( advancing with tempo) 62. Rh1 Kh5 (White was threatening mate) 63. Rxh3+ Kg4 and Black will soon have a full fledge Queen on his hands.
353,14,82,5Kg7,b'R2N4/4p1k1/6P1/2K1bP2/p7/np5p/8/8 w - -',Forced or else mate follows.

365,14,94,6Re1,b'8/6k1/8/2K2PN1/8/n6p/1p6/4R3 b - -',There won't be enough mating material left on the board after 66...b1Q 67. Rxb1 Nxb1 68. Nxh3 Kf6 so draw was agreed at this point. A very difficult and sharp endgame that was like walking a tightrope that is set aflame behind you.

465,21,0,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',A very common variation of the Nimzo-Indian defense. The most popular line here involves White playing for the two bishops with 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 keeping the pawn structure intact where Black normally prefers 6...b6 to develop the queenside bishop to the long diagonal. I normally prefer the gambit line 6...b5!? 7.cxb5 c6 with lightsquare play for the pawn.

Of course my theoretical knowledge is deficient given that I only recently started studying the Nimzo-Indian. 5...d5 also leads to a common position although the normal move order there is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 d5 5.e3 O-O. Since I don't play 4...d5 of course I wouldn't play 5...d5 here.

538,23,13,d4,b'8/p4kp1/1p3p1p/2p5/3pnN2/7P/PPP1KPP1/8 w - -',because it forced this too soon. My king is really far.

This flexible move allows variations of all three though it doesn't particularly help the Saemisch as it deprives the Ng1 of e2.
717,34,1,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR b KQ -',Again White refrains from Nf3 causing me to think awhile.  Eventually I reasoned that if 6...e5 would have been my move with the N on f3 it must still be good with it on g1 ...
718,34,2,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR b KQ -',White plays the knee-jerk response.  Both his bishops have good ranges albeit largely contested by Black's pieces and pawns.
719,34,3,a5,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR w KQ a6',?! I want to bring my QN to c5 to attack e4 and generally cause a nuisance not such a good plan if White is really planning to play f3 and the Saemisch.  This early thrust inhibits White from playing a version of the Bayonet Attack with 8. b4 thus protecting c5 from disturbance.  Sometimes this is only played after the N has gone to c5 but that seems to be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  In retrospect I think I would have been better preparing immediately for kingside action with 7...Ne8.
720,34,4,h4,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P2P/2N1B3/PP2BPP1/R2QK1NR b KQ h3',!? Unexpected - but maybe it shouldn't have been.  White beats Black to the first aggressive gesture on the kingside and this sets the tone of the game.  Black never gets to play a typical King's Indian strategy.
721,34,5,h5,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp2pb1/3p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1B3/PP2BPP1/R2QK1NR w KQ h6',Ghastly memories of the thrashing I received at the hands of Martin's teammate Paul Paxton-Doggett earlier in the season informed this move designed to stop the pawn in its tracks.
722,34,6,f3,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp2pb1/3p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR b KQ -',A dual purpose move allowing Qd2 by preventing the annoying ...Ng4 and also supporting the potential pawn advance g4.
723,34,7,Na6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQ -',This develops the N without blocking in the Bc8 and heads as planned for c5 whence it is ready for action on either wing theoretically.
724,34,8,1Nh3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1N/PP2B1P1/R2QK2R b KQ -',White also develops his N to the wing clearly prepared to give up the chance of castling kingside.
725,34,9,1Bxh3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1b/PP2B1P1/R2QK2R w KQ -',This bishop often impales itself for nothing more than a pawn on h3 so why not swap it there for White's N?  Blacks lsb is often a liability in the King's Indian anyway.
726,34,10,Qd7,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP2B1P1/R2QK3 w Q -',The idea behind this move was to inhibit White's planned g-pawn advance since on g4 it would be pinned against the Rh3.  I hoped thereby to slow down White's attack sufficiently to generate some activity for myself.  This move also connects my Rooks.
727,34,11,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/R3K3 b Q -',White prepares the typical Bh6 thrust and queenside castling.
728,34,12,1Kh7,b'r4r2/1ppq1pbk/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/R3K3 w Q -',This move was played to prevent 13. Bh6.  It also gives Black's N another retreat square so that Black can possibly advance his f-pawn - but actually I was already feeling that it was too late to play such a move because White was already ready to play g4.  If Black played ...Ng8 followed by ...f5 he would merely be weakening his own kingside with little prospect of getting an attack going.
729,34,13,b6,b'r4r2/2pq1pbk/np1p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/2KR4 w - -',Played so that if White swapped B for N on c5 Black wouldn't have to recapture with the d-pawn thus giving White's advanced d-pawn scope for a future advance.  I think this was too slow though.  An immediate 13...Nc5 followed by ...a4 might have given Black the start of an attack which at least would have given White cause to think about something other than his kingside attack.  White's B is much more concerned with the holes in Black's kingside anyway.
730,34,14,1Rg1,b'r4r2/2pq1pbk/np1p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/2K3R1 b - -',!  I'd expected Rh1 to defend the Rh3 preparing g2-g4-g5; but this prepares doubling on the g-file: much more powerful.
731,34,15,1Nc5,b'r4r2/2pq1pbk/1p1p1np1/p1nPp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/2K3R1 w - -',Black finally gets his N where he wants it but it's a useless spectator for most of the game.
732,34,16,1Qc2,b'r4r2/2pq1pbk/1p1p1np1/p1nPp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PPQ1B1P1/2K3R1 b - -',White over-defends e4 and covers the squares b3 and a4 while setting up a piercing glare at Black's king.  It should only take a few well-aimed blows for his majesty to be fatally exposed.
733,34,17,1Bh6,b'r4r2/2pq1p1k/1p1p1npb/p1nPp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PPQ1B1P1/2K3R1 w - -',Played to prevent 16. f4 when neither ...exf4 allowing 17. e5 nor any other move allowing 17. f5 or 17. fxe5 looked attractive.
734,34,18,Kh7,b'r4r2/2pq1p1k/1p1p1np1/p1nPp2p/2P1P1PP/2N2P1R/PPQ1B3/2K3R1 w - -',I didn't think I could allow 18. g5+ when my Queen's discovered attack on the Rh3 would have been useless though it would of course still have discouraged 19. gxf6.
735,34,19,1Rhg3,b'r4r2/2pq1p1k/1p1p1np1/p1nPp2p/2P1P1PP/2N2PR1/PPQ1B3/2K3R1 b - -',Now the g-pawn is free to move and g6 and g7 are looking very weak.
736,34,20,1g5,b'r5r1/2pq1p1k/1p1p1np1/p1nPp1Pp/2P1P2P/2N2PR1/PPQ1B3/2K3R1 b - -',I'd been hoping for this since it seems to reduce White's attacking options but it pushes Black further back into his shell.  I was now 100% preoccupied with defence abandoning any ideas of counter-attacking on the queenside with for example ...a4 followed by ...Nb3+ (a possibility I've only just seen) ...axb3 and ...Ra1+.  Whether Black could achieve such a sequence and whether it would have been worth trying I leave to the reader to consider ...
737,34,21,Raf8,b'5rr1/2p1qpnk/1p1p2p1/p1nP2Pp/2P1Pp1P/2N2R1B/PPQ5/2K3R1 w - -',Black couldn't hold on to the extra pawn so didn't try to.

744,34,28,2Nxe4,b'4nr2/2p1qprk/1p1p1Rp1/p2P2Pp/2P1n2P/2N2R1B/PP3Q2/2K5 w - -',?? This throws it away but Martin pointed out that 29. Be6 was on its way anyway so Black was already doomed.

748,35,0,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',One of my favorite openings because it throws the other player on their own resources.

754,35,6,1Nh3,b'r3k2r/1p1q1ppp/2n1bp2/p7/8/Q2P3N/PP1KPPBP/R6R b kq -',Black still needs to castle but it appears an even middle game has been reached.

This was our third game and i won the previous two... Well his rating is around 950 and mine is around 1420...But a huge mistake of mine showed that he's gonna win... Well i started with e4.
767,36,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He played e5..

770,36,4,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So i took his e5 pawn.
771,36,5,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',f6 was not the greatest defence..
772,36,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So i put it  back.
773,36,7,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p3p1n/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He opened his knight in a awkard square instead of doing something different to develop his pieces in better squares.

858,38,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Ideally I like taking control of the center by advancing my center pawns.  I think that it gives a kind of spatial advantage.

I had a general Idea of how I was going to attack so I threatened mate with Qd2 and he guards by moving his knight to f5.
866,38,8,Ncxd4,b'2r2rk1/pp1b1ppp/1q2p3/3pPn2/1b1n2P1/2NQ1N2/PPB2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',I attack his knight with my pawn and he takes my pawn at d4. I felt like he was trying to go 13...Ncxd4 14. Nfxd4 Qxd4 15. Qxd4 Nfxd4 but now that I look back at this position it might have been okay to take his night on d4 because my bishop is guarding my queen so it could have been. 13... Ncxd4 14. Nfxd4 Qxd4 15. gxf5 Qxd3 16. Bxd3 this would have been fine but i did not see this at the time so I took his night on f5 with my pawn.

I thought that I had seen every move that he could make and I thought it was over. No matter what he moved I could easily see a forced mate if he moves his king anywhere I have forced mate and I thought that no matter what piece he moved he couldn't stop the attack but I was so into the game that I had missed a simple move.
870,38,12,1Rfh8,b'2r4r/pp1b1pkp/1q2p3/3pP1N1/8/2bQ4/PPn2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Rh8 and that guards the pawn so I can't checkmate. I was pretty shocked that I had missed that simple move after this point the game started to get a little dangerous for me.

872,38,14,1Qe2,b'2r4r/pp1b1pkp/1q2p3/3pb1N1/8/8/PP2QP1P/R1B2RK1 b - -',Yup he takes my pawn opening having the rook attack my queen so I move it out of the way and attack his bishop.
873,38,15,1Qd4,b'2r4r/pp1b1pkp/4p3/3pb1N1/3q4/8/PP2QP1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',I think that this move was a blunder on for black because it gave me a nice forking opportunity. black should have just guarded his bishop with his f-pawn that would have also driven my knight back.
874,38,16,Bxh2+,b'2r4r/pp1b1pkp/4p3/3p4/3q4/5N2/PP2QP1b/R1B2RK1 w - -',I fork his his bishop and Queen so he takes my pawn and checks my king with his bishop.

879,38,21,Rg8,b'2r1k1r1/pp1b1pBp/4p3/8/4p3/5N2/PP3P1K/R5R1 w - -',I was really worried about my position and it took me along time to figure out what my next move would be. Finally the only sensible move that I saw was Ne5 getting my knight to safety and attacking his bishop.
880,38,22,Rc2,b'4k1r1/pp1b1pBp/4p3/4N3/4p3/8/PPr2P1K/R5R1 w - -',This was the move that i was hoping he would not make the only thing I could do was take his bishop and if he took back with his king I would have a checking opportunity.
881,38,23,Kc6,b'6r1/pp3pBp/2k1p3/8/4p3/8/PPr2P1K/3R2R1 w - -',When we got to this position my position not very good if I do not do something fast black is going to take up all my pawns with his rook. It took me about 10 minutes to find the only move that could save me for now.
882,38,24,2Bd4,b'6r1/pp3p1p/2k1p3/8/3Bp3/8/PPr2P1K/3R2R1 b - -',I was really happy with this move not only did this protect both of my pawns but I was also offering a trade of rooks which I really wanted the trade.
883,38,25,hxg6,b'8/pp3p2/2k1p1p1/8/3Bp3/8/PPr2P1K/3R4 w - -',He brings his rook to g6 and I decide to make the rook trade I just really wanted to simplify the situation as much as I could but I new that I was in trouble because right now I think his position is better than mine.  His pawns are in a better position than mine and I can tell that once the pawns start to come down it is going to be tough for me to keep him from queening.  I figure that if I can somehow get my king to e5 that I can somehow hold the position.
884,38,26,3Ke5,b'8/p4p2/1pk1p1p1/4K3/3Bp3/8/PP2rP2/3R4 b - -',I was lucky that black did not really have a good way of preventing my king from getting to e5. Now that I look back at this position I realize that I like my position because all of my pieces were protected but at the time I thought that I was barely holding on.  I didn't think that I was losing but I didn't feel like I was winning.
