First, instead of 54...Rf3+, we looked at what would happen if he forked before I promoted, so 54...Kc6  Black, however, would still be busted because of my a4 pawn since there is no way out of mate as he said.  For example, 55.d7 Kxd5 56.d8=Q+ Kc6 57.Qd7+ Kc5 58.Rb5#   But, as I thought that he made lucky blunders that allowed me to pull a swindle and win.  However, Jack said that the blunders that he made were not luck.  Instead, he allowed me to win because of my readiness to resign.  What he's emphasizing is something similar to what I see in TA's blitz Q sacs which is another reason I like studying them.  That is, don't resign so quickly, even if, you are at a disadvantage.  For, you don't know when you're opponent will go wrong.  I partially agree with him, especially with players at or below my rating.  But, I have doubts with players a lot stronger because ION, Ken, and reversion have all said that one should resign after getting a piece or higher, or when you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  That's what I thought against Jack, but he showed me otherwise which is why he has let his opponents win before.  However, another way of looking at it is not to trust your opponent.  So, one must decide whether to agree or not.  Normally, I would not and think of it as luck.  But, I don't here because after 47.f4, black did not capture with 47...exf4+  Had he done that, after 48.Kxf4, black is still winning and for the same reason being that my dangerous pawn is gone.  And, that would, in return, take away the opportunity to get back in the game.  And, after 49.fxe5, combined with the checks, he did not take back with ...dxe5.  Yes, I'd still get a pawn back but would, in return, lose the passed pawn which was used to promote and win the game.  So, him not taking back and allowing me to promote is what made me realize that there was no luck here.  And, that's because, in general, Mr. Stockel does not miss moves like that.  Therefore, the moral of this story is to not resign just because you feel that there is nothing left to learn.  Instead, keep playing, and only resign when the position hopeless against a stronger player.  So, as a new guideline I'll thinking of some of them similar to the Supplemental Talking the Talk (original WTW rules).  And, those rules state that one is not allowed to resign until a mate is proven.  That is, until the runner has a forced mating sequence. "

I think what was lacking was any urgency to fully develop his pieces.  Instead of focusing on the white pawn that was effectively dead, White should have worked to finalize development sooner.  White moved his queen into Black territory twice, without a clear strategy and the second time it should have been maintaining defense.  When making forays into enemy territory, seek to use multiple pieces to have a sustained presence and threat.  Finally, you have to play defensively sometimes.  Don't move out pieces that are critical to defense and consider all potential moves on enemy attacks and understand when you have to trade, even if it's not to your advantage. Being ahead in points doesn't matter if you get checkmated.

Thanks for your comments and review."

Although, Jeremy's rating is higher, I don't blame for not taking chances.  And, that's due to the fact that Charles was able to outplay Janet in a game that I annotated about a month ago."

Even though it's not a London System, what I studied there from Susan Polgar is very applicable here because with the move played, it would now be a mistake for Charles to take on b2.

However, I believe that this is the losing move because of what's to follow.  And, I only say that because of the misfortune with Jack Stockel in my first game with Tom Walsh on Friday, during the tournament.  So, it was the game before my very last annotation, in which Jack Stockel yelled at Tom and I which had negative affects on our play during the second game.  The mistake that should've lost was taking a pawn.  Sure, I was up a Queen for a minor piece or two.  But, then I took the doubled.  The problem was my N being pinned against my Queen with two of his Rooks.  I was very lucky that Tom overlooked it, but had he doubled up on one file, I would've lost the N, and would have to hand back my Queen to avoid mate.  From then on, I would be in a lost position.  Well I believe that more or less could be said here since these two pawns are weak.  And, is combined Jeremy's Ne5 and Bb5 becoming the killers for this game."

What's more is that aside from maybe from one move, nothing else came into consideration.  The reason is that he has doubled pawns.  But, this is an inaccuracy as my assessment.  I remember that Ken said it was also worth exchanging when you double up the opponents the pawn around the K.  That's what where I thought it was.  However, that, I believe was ghost vision.  As yes, he has doubled pawns, but it's no of major asset since it's around the Q side, instead.  And, I also overlooked that my Nf6 is still pinned.  With those two things, the timing wasn't right which means that my judgement still needs fixing.  That's because once he takes back, Stanley will have better mobility with the center as he is breaking through which is something that one does not want to see. "

But, that's moving too quickly right there.  I didn't play it because I was worried about an exchange which wouldn't have benefited me.  What I overlooked is where his N is located.  Somehow, I thought it was on d2 or on e3 which is more likely.  I forgot that it's in a place that taking would've won a pawn.  Had I spent a little more time, I would've seen this, and thus, taken on c4.  I think that getting too excited made me think like Turtose, as opposed to, the Hair, as I've mentioned.  In doing so, Stanley will get the favorable exchange."

White has a 3-1 majority on the K-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - Black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.

DON'T JUST ASSUME THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE, BUT ASK YOURSELF WHY HE PLAYED IT.""  That is an important lesson that GM Susan Polgar emphasized, and I have taught my students.  And, it seems so obvious, but it wasn't.  That's because right after my resignation, I had to get going, at once.  In other words, I had no more then 5 seconds to spare.  As noted, If time was on my side, I would've continued with 29...Rg8.  And, it would go as smoothly as it should be.  So, it's a good thing that it finished, as now, it's at least lost, instead of still in progress.  That's because if it doesn't finish, it remains that way as we don't resume.  Therefore, what there is to learn is actually what happened in the beginning where I blundered my piece, more then the threat that I would've seen with more time.  My take is that when a piece is threatened, you must ask yourself if they'll take with check or not.  Had I not been in check, my piece would've protected, as Tom would not have taken due to the Queen being in danger.  But, having gotten the check he had won a piece."

If you see what looks like a blunder, you can suppose that it is, but make no such assumption.  Equally: you can suppose the apparent blunder disguises something sneakily nasty.  But do not assume so.  I am reminded of an old US acquaintance (TS) domiciled in my own country telling me about his victory over a Grandmaster - Larry Evans, I think it was, or it might have been Sammy Reshevsky.  At about move 9, the Great Man left a piece 'en prise'.  Our friend, TS, simply could not, for the life of him, figure out the plot.  What dastardly scheme did the GM have in mind?  So TS simply took the piece.  'I guess we'll find out now,' he thought.  He found out, all right!  Having made a simple blunder, the GM promptly resigned.  It happens to us all.  With GMs, it is a rarity, but not at all unknown.   Here, Black had to play 17...Kc7 though the following King hunt ought eventually to have cornered him: 18.Rf5 ... (I was actually thinking of the immediate Rf7ch, but this finesse is more decisive) 18...Qa7  19.Rf7ch ... [A] 19...Kb6 20.Bd8ch Kg5  21.Qd3ch Ka4 22.Bb3# or [B] 19...Kb8! 20.Qg4 Qc4!  21.d5!?

With that, I don't completely agree with his assessment.  As I believe that 20...Kh6?? was the losing blunder, in it of itself.  For had I taken back, and Jack had taken back, I have made up for lost material and would have plenty to fight for.  Not only that, but his attacking forces against my King would not have been as strong.  So, there would've been a chance for me to get a draw.  But, by moving the monarch the way I did, black was busted because of what happened afterwards.  After this game, Jack went back to making a mistake, in which I got a piece, but moved a little quickly.  Then, I messed up in the endgame since I had to leave.  In doing so, it ended in a draw.  The moral of this story is what Jack and I discussed in the Men's Room while saying goodbye.  So, on top of taking enough time, he said that one the things that must come into consideration is the K.  And, that I need to watch out for it's safety.   I agree with him there since K safety is very important, as Jack Stockel has previously emphasized with this being the perfect example."
