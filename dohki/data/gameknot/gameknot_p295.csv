0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I usually play 1.e4 because 2 pieces are released. But 1.d4 I play rarely because sometimes it can get boring but 1.d4 is what many grandmasters play. But it was worth a try!
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',not very common against  1.d4.  I tried to get him into the French defence by doing.....

           the Queen-side that did not even bother me. It was not too late at this

36,1,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I decided to try the Vienna Game.
37,1,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The Max Lange variation.  The Falkbeer variation Nf6 is more common but both are solid.
38,1,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Other good moves are f4 and g3 as well as Nf3 transposing to the Three Knights Opening.
39,1,3,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2BnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This move surprised me probably developing another piece would be better.  It does threaten a fork at c2 so my queen can't move.
40,1,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2BnP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Since he undefended e5 this is the natural response.  If Nxf3 Qxf3 threatens scholar's mate and gives me the edge in development.
41,1,5,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/2BnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',In addition to gaining the pawn this threatens Nxf7.
42,1,6,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4N3/2BnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? d5 or Ne6 would have stopped the fork.
43,1,7,Nxf7,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/3b1n2/8/2BnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Winning the rook.

45,1,9,Ne2,b'r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/3b4/8/2Bnn3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQq -',If Nxe2 Qxe2 his attack has lost it's bite.
46,1,10,Be5,b'r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/8/4b3/2Bnn3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQq -',Preparing Qd6 for an attack on h2?  Probably actually preparing what happened in the game.
47,1,11,Nf7,b'r1b1k3/ppppqNpp/8/4b3/2Bnn3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQq -',"I wanted to get my king out with O-O but that would lead to 9...Bxh2  10. Kxh2 (Kh1 Qh4 looks bad) Qh4  11. Kg1 Nf3  12. gxf3 Qg5  13. Ng3 (to avoid three-fold repetition I failed to notice Kh2) Nxg3 14. fxg3 (I failed to notice Re1 ) Qxg3  with three-fold repetition to follow.
So I'll get my knight out of danger and threaten the bishop."
48,1,12,Qc5,b'r1b1k3/pppp1Npp/8/2q1b3/2Bnn3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQq -',I figured he was attacking my bishop with thoughts of attack but not an immediate plan.
49,1,13,1Nxe5,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/8/2q1N3/2Bnn3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQq -',"? So I went ahead and took his bishop expecting Qxe5.
Nxd4 would have been the best move."
50,1,14,1Nf3+,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/8/2q1N3/2B1n3/5n2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQq -',! A very nice move setting up the discovered threat of Qxf2# which can't be prevented since the king is in check.
51,1,15,1Nxf3,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/8/2q5/2B1n3/5N2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQq -',I decided to let him finish the checkmate.
52,1,16,1Qxf2#,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/8/8/2B1n3/5N2/PPPPNqPP/R1BQK2R w KQq -',A very interesting ending position.  The loser is up by 11 points we both have 6 pawns left on their starting squares most of my back rank and half of his queenside haven't moved and 14 of the 22 moves have been by knights.
53,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is a brilliant game which arises after a the wild Danish Gambit which is rapidly becoming a favourite of mine. 1.e4 The best opening move in my opinion. This was the most common opening move in the 19th century and still is today according to the GK Database. As Bobby Fischer once said ""best by test."" Another great exponent of 1.e4 was the best player of all time in my opinion Paul Morphy."
54,2,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the center game. This attempts to rip open the centre by exchanging pawns. However white opts not to make the more 'sound' move 3. Qxd4. He decideds to play a romantic gambit instead. 
55,2,2,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the best move. 2...d6 is posible which transposes into a philidor which is a fairly average defence in my opinion and is now not seen at GM level.
56,2,3,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Danish Gambit is to follow. However this move signifies the start of the Goering Gambit. White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. With care Black can accept one or both pawns but I express with great care. Black can decline the gambit safely but that's just boring In my opinion so accept and test your defensive skills I say.
57,2,4,dxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Day is no spoil sport he accepts the second pawn.
58,2,5,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The Danish Gambit. White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. With care Black can accept one or both pawns but I can't express enough WITH GREAT CARE! Black can decline the gambit safely but that's just boring In my opinion so accept and test your defensive skills I say.
59,2,6,cxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/Pp3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',He accepts the exchange. You can tell this game is going to get fun now!
60,2,7,Bxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Already you can see that here whites position is much better. He is nearly fully developed and is almost ready to launch an attack. Another thing that you can see is that the majority of whites Queenside pawns have been eliminated. This is the main weakness in the DG because if it gets into an endgame black has the advantage because of the Q-side majority. However it is a rather double edged sword because the pawns have been sacrificed white starts setting a very powerful attack. Black on the other hand has not developed a single piece.
61,2,8,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',This is a common move which aims to pin the knight so he can attack the e4-pawn. However the best move would have been 5... d5 6. Bxd5 Nf6 7. Bxf7  Kxf7 8. Qxd8 Bb4  9. Qd2 Bxd2  10. Nxd2. With a balanced endgame with maybe a slight edge to black in the endgame.
62,2,9,d6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',This opens a diagonal for his light squared bishop. It also sets black to play Nf6 at some point without d6 Nf6 would be weak because of the e4-e5 push of the pawn.
63,2,10,Qb3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/1bB1P3/1QN5/PB3PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',This is a fairly thematic move in the DG aiming at the f7 pawn while also attacking the bishop.
64,2,11,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/1Qb5/PB3PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Black decides to exchange which is probably his only option as if he retreats he loses a tempo. He could however of played 7...Nc6.
65,2,12,Bxc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/1QB5/P4PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Another possitive effect 7.Qb3 has done it has locked the light squared bishop to the back rank defending the b7 pawn. The key aim for white is to gain a massive advantage in development and then involve all hi pieces in a final mating attack.
66,2,13,Qg5,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/6q1/2B1P3/1QB5/P4PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',?! This is meant to be some type of counter attack on the g2 pawn. A better move would have been to develop one of his pieces or playing his queen to d7.
67,2,14,Bxf7+,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2Bpp/3p4/6q1/4P3/1QB5/P4PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',The pawn is hanging so Blackburne may as well take it and shorten his material disadvantage.
68,2,15,1Nf3,b'rnb2knr/ppp2Bpp/3p4/6q1/4P3/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This develops a piece prepares to castle kingisde and threatens black's queen gaining another precious tempo. 
69,2,16,1Qg4,b'rnb2knr/ppp2Bpp/3p4/8/4P1q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',This move aims to attack the e4 pawn but white's next move deems the attack useless. Better would have been 10...Qe7. If he took the g2 pawn then blacks queen might become fairly passive which is not very good as it is one of the only developed pieces black can use to defend.
70,2,17,1O-O,b'rnb2knr/ppp2Bpp/3p4/8/4P1q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',! I like this move because it contains a positional trap which defends the capture of the e4 pawn without moving a piece to defend it. If you have not already spotted it if 11...Qxe4 12. Rf-e1 and White has a very powerful attack which will either result in mate or at the expense of material for black.
71,2,18,1Nh6,b'rnb2k1r/ppp2Bpp/3p3n/8/4P1q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This move attacks the bishop and therefore forces it to move. Black feels this is important because or the threat of mate on the back rank.
72,2,19,1Bc4,b'rnb2k1r/ppp3pp/3p3n/8/2B1P1q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black achieves this for now but the bishop is still in a powerful attacking position.
73,2,20,1Nc6,b'r1b2k1r/ppp3pp/2np3n/8/2B1P1q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is amazing. Black is still developing his pieces while white is already fully developed with a safe king and a powerful attack.
74,2,21,1e5,b'r1b2k1r/ppp3pp/2np3n/4P3/2B3q1/1QB2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White pushes a pawn trying to open one of the central files.
75,2,22,Qg5,b'r1b2k1r/ppp3pp/7n/4B1q1/2B5/1Q6/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black tries to fend of white's bishop again.
76,2,23,1Rfe1,b'r1b2k1r/ppp3pp/7n/4B1q1/2B5/1Q6/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White defends with the rook while putting his rook on an incredibly powerful square.
77,2,24,1Nf5,b'r1b2k1r/ppp3pp/8/4Bnq1/2B5/1Q6/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',?! Black tries to get his knight involved but completely forgets his hanging pawn on c7.
78,2,25,1Bxc7,b'r1b2k1r/ppB3pp/8/5nq1/2B5/1Q6/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White is now equal in material and is in a won position.
79,2,26,1Qb4+,b'r4k1r/ppBb2pp/8/5nq1/1QB5/8/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',! This starts white on a combination which is almost entirely forced.
80,2,27,1Ne7,b'r4k1r/ppBbn1pp/8/6q1/1QB5/8/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Only possible move.
81,2,28,1Rxe7,b'r4k1r/ppBbR1pp/8/6q1/1QB5/8/P4PPP/R5K1 b - -',! This sets up the skewer with the bisho when black takes with his queen which by the way is forced the only other option which is very respectable in a such a position is 19... 1-0!

I wish Paul Morphy had played this openings as white because he would have created games just as good as this if not even better because he truly understood the power of development.. I hope you liked this game as much as I did. If you have any feed back or any complaints on mistakes you've spotted please PM me. Oh yes one more thing if you enjoyed this game then I recommend you look at my annotated game called 'Naval intelligence' which involves the Evan's Gambit which is a lot similar to the DG. It offers a good intro to the opening.

109,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I first saw this game on www.chessgames.com as it was game of the day sometime back and took a liking to it as I was studying the Guico Piano at the time.1.e4 The most common opening move and in my opinion the best as I have stated in most of the game that I have annotated.. However it's stats are falling because the surge of the sicilian monster!
110,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Siezes space in the centre like white has done.
111,4,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Attacks the e5 pawn a pretty standard move.
112,4,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Defends it. Also standard!
113,4,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of ""Naval Intelligence"" a very nice little game!.) "
114,4,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. Tartakower now has the chance to play my fave as I have already mentioned the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?
115,4,6,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',THis prepares d4 however has the setback of weakening the e4 pawn as the natural Nc3 to defend the e4 pawn is now impossible. The other main option is 4.b4?! the Evan's Gambit which you can see in the game titled 'Naval Intelligence'
116,4,7,Bb6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is an old fashioned approach to this opening. This move is an early retreat from the inevitable d4 advance attacking the bishop. The better and more modern approach would be 4... Nf6 attacking the e4 pawn.
117,4,8,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',The d4 advance seizing space in the centre aiming for the typical Italian centre.
118,4,9,Qe7,b'r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This seems a strange move because most people would play 5... d6 here however the chosen move is still adequate.
119,4,10,O-O,b'r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Getting his king in a safe place before embarking on attacking the enemy king.
120,4,11,d6,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/1bnp4/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This secures the e5 pawn.

124,4,15,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',This is a typical position from the Giuoco Piano well atleast it would have been in theory 50 years ago. At this point whites position is more agressive in the centre but but is hard to make progress as Black can retain his central strong point at e4.
125,4,16,Na3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',! I think this is a good move because it starts the knight on a long journey Nc2-e3-d5 where it proves to do a very effective job.
126,4,17,Nd8,b'r1bn1rk1/ppp1qppp/1b1p1n2/4p3/2BPP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',This move anticipates white moving his knight to d5 it allows ...c6 if White's Knight moves to d5.

However you'll see that Tartakower didn't have the same opinion of the bishop defending the King-side.
128,4,19,1Ne8,b'r1bnnrk1/ppp1qppp/1b1p4/4p3/3PP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRBK1 w - -',??This looks like a backwards move and it is inferior as you've probably guessed but its plan itself is not bad. The plan is to support e4 by ...f6.  a better plan would have been 10... exd4 11.cxd4 Nxe4.
129,4,20,f6,b'r1bnnrk1/ppp1q1pp/1b1p1p2/4p3/2NPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRBK1 w - -',Black has reinforced his e-pawn.

131,4,22,1c6,b'r1bnnrk1/pp2q1pp/1bpp1p2/4p3/P1NPP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQRBK1 w - -',Black decides to choose the latter option. 
132,4,23,1Nxb6,b'r1bnnrk1/pp2q1pp/1Npp1p2/4p3/P2PP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQRBK1 b - -',This is an effective move it exchanges his Knight which is ineffectively placed on the wing for a well placed Bishop that puts pressure on the centre.
133,4,24,1axb6,b'r1bnnrk1/1p2q1pp/1ppp1p2/4p3/P2PP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQRBK1 w - -',Now black has a semi-open file for the exchange you'll see that this proves useful later on in the game.
134,4,25,1Qb3+,b'r1bnnrk1/1p2q1pp/1ppp1p2/4p3/P2PP3/1QP2N1P/1P3PP1/R1B1RBK1 b - -',A queen fork! It forks the King and the hanging pawn on b6.
135,4,26,1Ne6,b'r1b1nrk1/1p2q1pp/1pppnp2/4p3/P2PP3/1QP2N1P/1P3PP1/R1B1RBK1 w - -',Black parries the King with his little horsey!

137,4,28,1g5,b'r1b1nrk1/1p2q2p/1Qppnp2/4p1p1/P2PP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1B1RBK1 w - g6',! Black attacks Whites weakened kingside. Even though it weakens his own kingside he feels that he doesn't have anything to lose as he has already had a setback in material.
138,4,29,1Bc4,b'r1b1nrk1/1p2q2p/1Qppnp2/4p1p1/P1BPP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',White ignores blacks threat on the kingside. He should have left his bishop on f1 to help defend and play16.g3 preventing Blacks ...Nf4. However if he did that he wouldn't of made this game this entertaining!
139,4,30,1h6,b'r1b1nrk1/1p2q3/1Qppnp1p/4p1p1/P1BPP3/2P2N1P/1P3PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',This is so if white takes the e5 pawn he can retake with the f-pawn with out the risk of having the g5 Pawn taken by White's Knight on f3.
140,4,31,1h4,b'r1b1nrk1/1p2q3/1Qppnp1p/4p1p1/P1BPP2P/2P2N2/1P3PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',? Whitebreaks the rule that you should not move the pawns on the side that is being attacked. Better would have been 17.d5 or 17.b3
141,4,32,1Kh7,b'r1b1nr2/1p2q2k/1Qppnp1p/4p1p1/P1BPP2P/2P2N2/1P3PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I am not sure what the point of this move was. If you think you know please PM me. Maybe it was to support his Kingside advance.

143,4,34,2g3,b'r1b1n2r/1p2q2k/1Qp1np2/4p1p1/P1B1P3/2P1BNP1/1P3P2/R3R1K1 b - -',? THis move must have been so frustrating for the people who watched this game. He again weakens his kingside. I think a better move would have would have been to evacuate the king via f1 and e2.

151,4,42,Nc4+,b'r7/1p3k2/1Qp2p2/8/P1n1b3/KPP5/3q1P2/2R3R1 w - -',! With this sacrifice and the one one the next move finally destroys the white king's defence on the Queenside once and for all!

As you can see a very good game. White is in the better position out of the opening but he ignores blacks threat on the kingside early on in the middlegame an from there on in Whites position goes down hill with the help of a few masterful sacrifices by Max Euwe.

Black should have also allowed white to take; the black pawn is stronger on f5 than e6 at this point.

On closer examination it becomes clear why -- white will be unable to stop the black queenside pawns from queening long before his own pawns can queen -- it's the power of a good bishop plus good king position.  After all of that fighting white still can't save the game!  Kh7 was black's last hope but it's met by Be4 ! cementing the win for white.
294,8,48,3Ne5,b'4k1r1/1b4P1/1p2p2K/pp2N3/3P1P2/4P3/P7/8 b - -',Nxb6 offers no chances.  37. Kh7 is no good now too as it's met by Rxg7  38. Kxg7 Kxd7 and black has an easy win.

Amazing though how despite being down a full major piece after the sacrifice white almost pulled out a victory.  I'm not sure that this game illustrates anything more than I'm just barely smart enough to not blow a won game but I hope you enjoyed it.

The present position differs in not exposing the queen to tactics on the a-file after ab (a feature of the Shirov game); on the other hand it deprives the e6 pawn of the queen's support.

This opening is very passive for Black but it is safer than the common variations and Black can play this to avoid studying although in the variations where Black gives up the centre instead of fighting for it with Nf6 or d5 White is usually better.
443,14,6,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto.

The dark bishop is developed to an active square but there are two drawbacks both of which are illustrated in this game. The bishop serves as a target as white pushes into the centre and black ends up with a backward c-pawn.

522,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a game between me (tomwhufc) and my good friend maarten. The opening is the sicilian in wich black blocks the centre with a kind of stonewall formation.
523,18,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',At this point I was planning on using the Grand Prix attack ( 2...d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 .) As you will see black has other plans.
524,18,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',This move clamps the d4 square. This seems at first sight to be a very strong move challenging for the centre. However there is now a possible outpost for my knight on d5 uncontested by any pawns on adjacent files. 
525,18,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This develops a piece prepares to castle kingside and attacks the centre aswell as the f7 pawn. 
526,18,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Also develops a piece and prepares to castle kingside.

528,18,6,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This solidifies  the pawns on c5 and e5. It creates a backwards pawn although black doesn't have any other choice. 
529,18,7,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This move may seem premature to some people although it is a crucial move because it  hinders the development of blacks lightsquared bishop.
530,18,8,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I feel black could have delayed this move as the development of my dark squared bishop was impossible at the time.
531,18,9,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This opens space for my bishop to be developed. As you can see Blacks central pawns do not complement the dark squared bishop as far as development is concerned this is because they are  on the dark squares blocking decent development. I knew this would happen after he played his pawns to c5d6 and e5. This also explains why I played 5.h3 which also hindered the dark squared bishops development. At this point Black effectively has two bad bishops. My (white's) position however is much better. My lightsquared bishop is outside my pawn chained and developed. Both my knights are in play I am about to castle kingside and move my dark squared bishop to e3. I have the a small edge.
532,18,10,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This develops a piece and threatend ... Nd4 wich would have given him a very powerful piece in my territory.
533,18,11,Ne2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',! This may seem a  backwards move but I planned to play c3 attacking d4 stopping the threat of ...Nd4. It also was meant to prepare d4 and if the worst came to the worst I could shift it to g3.
534,18,12,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/n1p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I think this was a good logical move. It threatens the bishop that hinders blacks lightsquared bishop's development. It attakcs the defender.
535,18,13,Nd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/n1p1p3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPPNNPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is another backwards move? It disobeys the opening principle of never moving apiece twice in the opening. But the alternatives were not to my liking. I could have played 8.Bb3 Nxb3 9.axb3. This would have left me with a powerful semi-open file but would have left me with doubled pawns.  I do not favour positions wich leave me with damaged pawn structure. Another option was to ignore the threat and castle kingside. Of course that would be a bad move bcause after 8. 0-0 Nxc4 dxc4 my position would be worse of than if i had played 8.Bb3 because I would have had doubled pawns without the semi-open file! This kind of justifies my decision to play 8.Nd2 even though  8.Bb3 is strategically better it is not to my style.
536,18,14,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2N1P3/3P3P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I was surprised by this move because I thought  ...Be6 was better.
537,18,15,1Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2N1P3/3PB2P/PPP1NPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I strengthen my hold on the d4 square.

539,18,17,1Nd2,b'r1bqk2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/1pp1p3/4P3/3PB2P/PPPNNPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I retreated again but this time the move is not so bad because my darksquared bishop has already been developed.
540,18,18,1Qa5,b'r1b1k2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/3PB2P/PPPNNPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',?! I am not certain why maarten played this move. It pins my knight but puts his queen in danger of attack from my minor pieces and pawns.
541,18,19,1c3,b'r1b1k2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/2PPB2P/PP1NNPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I lift the pin on the knight and prepare d4
542,18,20,1Ba6,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b2p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/2PPB2P/PP1NNPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',? I try not to use question marks but his move is awful. Black has done well to remove the defender and open up the e6 square for his light squared bishop but he doesn't use it.
543,18,21,1O-O,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b2p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/2PPB2P/PP1NNPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I castled kinsgide here. Looking back on this move I think that if I had realised the way the game was going I  should have waited and castled queenside. However this is not a bad move it is decent enough.
544,18,22,1b4,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b2p1n1p/q1p1p3/1p2P3/2PPB2P/PP1NNPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',This move attacks my hold on the d4 square and attacks my pawn on d3.

546,18,24,1Qb5,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b2p1n1p/1qp1p3/1p2P3/2PPB2P/PPQNNPP1/R4RK1 w kq -',This move thwarts my original plan of playing d4. I had no other option I had to completely close the centre with...
547,18,25,1c4,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b2p1n1p/1qp1p3/1pP1P3/3PB2P/PPQNNPP1/R4RK1 b kq -',As you can see the queenside is almost completely blocked. This means any attacking actions will be on the kingside of the board and I was smart enough to castle kingside!(sarcasm) I should have waited and seen what way the game was going before castling. However castling kingside is a sufficent move.
548,18,26,1b3,b'r3k2r/p3bpp1/b1qp1n1p/2p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PB2P/P1QNNPP1/R4RK1 b kq -',?? Completely blocking off the queenside.  There are three better options here. 1. A much better move may hav been 16. a3 because of 16...bxa3 17. bxa3 18.Rf-b1. This would have been a lot better because my king would have been a lot safer and I could have attacked the queenside without endangering my kingside as you will see my kingside is soon under attack in this game. 17. f4! which opens the centre and leaves the possibility of couterplay on the queenside. 3. Ng3 with the plan of putting it on f5 with a powerful position. Basically I played one of the worst possible moves here.(within reason)
549,18,27,1O-O,b'r4rk1/p3bpp1/b1qp1n1p/2p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PB2P/P1QNNPP1/R4RK1 w - -',?? THis completely contradicts everything I have said about king safety. There is no excuse for this move. The queenside is almost completely blocked off maarten should have delayed castling until he had completely blocked of the queenside then castled queenside and pawn stormed the kingside.
550,18,28,1f4,b'r4rk1/p3bpp1/b1qp1n1p/2p1p3/1pP1PP2/1P1PB2P/P1QNN1P1/R4RK1 b - f3',?! A dubious move. I overlooked 17. a3 bxa3 18. Rxa3. This would put me in a good position because I could double up rooks on a-file and put my queen there aswell creating a powerful cannon.
551,18,29,g5,b'r4rk1/p3bp2/b1qp1n1p/2p3p1/1pP1PN2/1P1PB2P/P1QN2P1/R4RK1 w - g6',This begins the start of a pawn storm. It threatened my knight but that is irrelevant becasue I was going to move my knight to d5 anyway.

554,18,32,2Rf3,b'r1b2rk1/p2qbp2/3p3p/2pP2p1/1pP3P1/1P1PBR1P/P1QN4/R5K1 b - -',?! I am not sure whu I made this move. It was probably because I was deluded enough to think that I would have a chance to double my rooks on the f-file and attack.
555,18,33,2f5,b'r1b2rk1/p2qb3/3p3p/2pP1pp1/1pP3P1/1P1PBR1P/P1QN4/R5K1 w - f6',! This is a good move. If 23. gxf5 Rxg5 24. Rxg5 Qxg5 my king would have been a dead man walking.
556,18,34,2Raf1,b'r1b2rk1/p2qb3/3p3p/2pP1pp1/1pP3P1/1P1PBR1P/P1QN4/5RK1 b - -',?! I am still deluded enough to think i was supporting the rook when in fact I was actually cutting off its points of retreaat! 23. Kh1 is better because if 23...f4   24. Bg1 leaving my rook with a place to retreat to.
557,18,35,2f4,b'r1b2rk1/p2qb3/3p3p/2pP2p1/1pP2pP1/1P1PBR1P/P1QN4/5RK1 w - -',My only option is...

Even though this is forced I still give this a question mark because I shouldn't have got my self into this position.Now my rook is immobile and I am effectively a major piece down! I think I deserve a round of applause for being able to muck my position up so badly.
559,18,37,2d4,b'r1b1qrk1/p3b3/3p3p/2pP2p1/1pPP1pP1/1P3R1P/P1QN1B2/5RK1 b - -',My only hope here was to check mate him down the a1-h8 diagonal.

Better would have been declining the sacrfice e.g. 28...Bd8 29. d7 Qxd7 30. Qg6   (if 30....  Kh8 white will win with the better position after 31. Bd4  .)  Qg7  31 Qxg7  Kxg7 32.

567,18,45,3Qg6+,b'r4rk1/p3q3/6Q1/3P4/1pP2pp1/1P3N2/P4B2/5RK1 b - -',! This has put me back into the game and threatens mate along the a1-h8 diagonal.
568,18,46,3Kh8,b'r4r1k/p3q3/6Q1/3P4/1pP2pp1/1P3N2/P4B2/5RK1 w - -',???????????????? This loses the game. Better would have been 31.... Qg7 which would have kept his king alive. However I would have exchanged queens and taken advantage of my massive queenside majority.
569,18,47,3Bd4+,b'r4r1k/p3q3/6Q1/3P4/1pPB1pp1/1P3N2/P7/5RK1 b - -',Maaarten finally realises the fatal consequences of his mistakes. He realises he had me by the throat and concentrated on ripping my throat off while I kicked him in the balls and killed him when he was distraught from his unsuccesful attack.  The moral of this game is that you are in the gravest danger when you are in the middle of a powerful attack. I would like to say thankyou to my good friend Maaarten for a fantastic game.

819,27,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Morphy sticks to his classical approach to chess. Always playing the King pawn openings when possible.
820,27,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The king's gambit. This opening was very popular in the 19th century. Although more rare these days it still has a sound reputation.
821,27,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nowadays this is considered the best way to play as black. 
822,27,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This move is contradictory to the opening principle that you should move your knights before bishops. HOwever it is an adequate move. It was famously moved by Bobby Ficher with 100% scored. Although I think the best move would be 3.Nf3.
823,27,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Morphy shows that he was ahead of his time by developing his knight as he did most of the time when he played the opening.
824,27,6,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2B2p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Andersson was seduced by this early attack on blacks knight thinking that it would gane him a tempo. However as you will see Morphy's precise play does the complete opposite. 
825,27,7,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pP3/2B2p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',! Morphy doesn't bother moving his threatened knight but instead decides to answer an attack with an attack.While also opening a diagonal for his queen's bishop and preparing an outpost for his knight on e4. Pretty good no?

827,27,9,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/4np2/1B6/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This secures the knight in an accurate position while blacks light squared bishop has been demoted toa passive role on b3.

However he weakens his kingside. A more solid move would have been 8...Ng5 moving his knight to a more stable position less likely to come under attack from whites queen pawn.
832,27,14,bxc6,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2p1p/2p5/3pP1p1/4npb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now white has a clear advantage in development. Anderssons's idea of the black's doubled c-pawns beingweak is absurd as you will see Morphy uses these pawns to his advantage.

Ok - the question here is to whether or not exchange the light squared bishops. That's why I hate the French.

So far this game hasn't been strictly about maintaining material equality. It has been equally stubborn surges of initiative.

Black tries to break white's king's position open by marching this loose pawn down the king's side while white's major pieces queue up to attack his uncastled king!

The move played stops black castling and makes the threats to his king more serious.

Whites attack keeps going but is missing the power it had black defends well then counter attacks and quickly mates as the white attack runs out of steam. i hope you enjoy

No way i would like to switch to a kind of Benoni (3.d5 exd5 4.exd5 d6) with my pawn still on c2 instead of c4. In that type of game black has problems with his space and white can put a knight on c4 AND play c2-c3 at some moment. Then black doesnt have the d4-square.
991,32,1,Qb6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Interesting! But black has to play well now. He will be behind in development soon!

On the other hand why make the same mistake as black does? (play too many queen moves). So 5.f4 is a good move! 5.Nf3 was also ok but less forcefull."

I expected 5...e5 or 5...f6 and black blocks on the black fields but placing his Q and B completly offside. After 5...e5 i intended to play 6.Nf3 (then if 6...f6? 7.fxe5 fxe5 8.Nxe5 Bxe5 9.Qh5  Qg6 10.Qxe5  and white is winning.

First i thought about 6.Nb5 Qa5  (6....Qb6 7.dxe6) 7.Bd2 Qb6 and that will be great as well eg 8.Bc3----->g7---->h8 but why not have some more fun?"

1004,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I was White in this game in an online tournament. I carefully maneuvered an attack against Black's frozen position after sacrificing a piece.
1005,33,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',1...c5 is the most common move against e4 because it leads to complicated imbalanced play while 1...e5 simply matches me in the centre while I have the tempo.
1006,33,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',I play King's Gambit a lot in short time control games. Although I never play it in longer games or correspondence games since the opening is considered unsound meaning Black should be able to recover from his underdeveloped position and hold onto his extra pawn.
1007,33,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black chooses to accept the pawn. If he doesn't want it he can play Bc5.
1008,33,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',3.Bc4 was the sharpest move but to play it you have to know the Qh4  Kf1 variation and I also want to preserve the option of developing my bishop to c4 or d3. Knights before Bishops.
1009,33,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I consider this a terrible move. MUCH better moves are Nf6 g5 Be7 or even simply d6.
1010,33,6,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Now I have more compensation for the pawn than I should have since Nc6 was a pointless move.
1011,33,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This position is totally winning for Black since he's up a pawn but it's hard for Black to win accurately since this was a fast timed game and it's easier for me to find good moves than it is for Black.
1012,33,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I considered d5 but it leads to an incredibly boring position. I want to defend my central pawns where they control much of the centre.
1013,33,9,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This isn't much of a threat since I can simply defend while developing a piece. Pins are usually stronger on g4 and g5 than they are on b4 and b5.

Giving me back the pawn immediately is safer but leaves me with a lead in development.
1015,33,11,Bxc3+,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPB2/2bB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black is strengthening my pawn structure by letting me pull a flank pawn toward the centre.

1021,33,17,1Nb8,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black actually played Re8 in this position but I don't want to redo my entire annotation just because of one mistake in analysis. Black played Re8 before Nb8. Black's knight does nothing on c6 so he wants to redevelop it to d7 to defend his helpless pinned knight.

I picked this one due to a rook sacrifice later in the game which I thought people may find interesting.  I am not a grandmaster (or anywhere near) I have not memorised all openings.  I do refer to a book for openings and I am not as good over the board as on this site.  However I do think about what I am doing and try to understand why certain moves are the preferred one.  This is my view of what happened and why - better players may disagree but lets not worry about that!  My favourite opening.  Who knows whats coming back at you?

Some  use Nc6 as the second move instead of d6 but I cannot find a variation that would result in the above position in my sources.

However after the immediate Ra6 I was worried about Qg5 followed by f3 with threats of mate on g2 or c1.  28 Qg4  still does not succeed in my opinion: ...Kc7 29 Ra7  (or Qxg7)  Kb6. The problem is that black can still block the 7th rank with Be7 at the same time threatening back rank mate. 28 Ra8  was still possible; then for example ...Kc7  29 Ra7 Kb6 30 Qe1 b4 31 Qa1; or 28 ...Kd7 29 Qg4 .

On the other hand black can easily force the queen off the long diagonal winning the b-pawn. The text is a (flawed) attempt to make counterplay on the light squares defending th g-pawn indirectly.
