With ...a6 I intended to nullify some of white's potential threats and steer the game into calmer waters while at the same time trying to give myself space and play on the queenside. 
230,7,3,b5,b'rnbq1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/1p6/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R w KQ b6',Part of my plan for queenside expansion.  Now if cxb5 then axb5 gives me a space edge on the queenside as well as an open file for my rook.  Or if white doesn't take on b5 then I have the option of bxc5 with an open b-file and potential to create a weak pawn for white later on with pressure against b2 with my rook and/or the a-pawn.
231,7,4,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/3nppbp/p1pp1np1/8/2BPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Strengthening e5 and preparing Nb6 or if white pushes d5 which he often does in the KID Nc5 which can be supported by an ...a5 push (hindering b4 by white dislodging the knight).
232,7,5,a5,b'r1bq1rk1/3nppbp/2pp1np1/p7/3PP3/1BN1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Still hoping white plays d5 while at the same time expanding on the queenside and preparing a possible Ba3 which could be very useful as the bishop cuts across the light squares where several white pieces lay currently and which might play some role in an annoying pin at some point.
233,7,6,Qb8,b'rq3rk1/3nppbp/b1pp1np1/p7/3PP3/1BN1BP2/PP2N1PP/2RQR1K1 w - -',Here I thought it might be useful to get the queen on the open file and put some pressure on the b2 square.  Also the queen can provide some protection for a knight maneuver to c4 (via b6) putting further pressure on b2 and the bishop on e3.
234,7,7,Nc4,b'rq3rk1/4ppbp/b1pp1npB/p7/2nPP3/1BN2P2/PP1QN1PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',I didn't feel as though the weakening of my dark squares (from the Bh6xBg7 exchange) was as problematic for me as the b-file pressure I was getting against him.  I thought I could get some good chances on the queenside with the open b-file and the a-pawn battering ram and wasn't that concerned about any kingside attack from white.  He really had no pieces on my kingside that could cause much damage while my rooks queen and bishop had some room to work in and some targets to take aim at on the queenside.
235,7,8,Qb4,b'r4r2/4ppkp/b1pp1np1/p7/Nq1PP3/1P3P2/P2QN1PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',After white's b3 I wasn't as confident I could generate much on the b-file so I decided an exchange of queens would do two things: first virtually eliminate any real mating or serious threats of white against my somewhat weakened kingside and second I would now have some pressure and play down the a-file if white exchanged queens.  And if he didn't exchange queens I thought his knight was awkward on the edge of the board and my queen was well positioned for threats to the a and b pawns.
236,7,9,2Rxc6,b'r4r2/4ppkp/b1Rp1np1/8/Np1PP3/1P3P2/P3N1PP/4R1K1 b - -',I thought this might have been a small inaccuracy.  I think e5 or Nb6 might have been slightly better with fewer counter play chances for black.  
237,7,10,e6,b'r4r2/2R2pkp/3ppnp1/8/Pp1PP3/5P2/P3N1PP/4R1K1 w - -',I thought quite awhile about this move and after I found it I liked it better than any of the other choices the primary reason being to hold onto the important central pawn and not allow myself another weakness with an isolated central pawn.  I felt that the latent dynamism of the two center pawns (or at the very least not having an isolated central pawn) was important and the two weak a-pawns for white would still be there for me to gobble up.
238,7,11,2Rb6,b'5r2/5pkp/1R1ppnp1/8/rp1PP3/5P2/P3N1PP/4R1K1 b - -',This struck me as more of a mistake than an inaccuracy.  Allowing me access to the c-file just didn't seem prudent.

417,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is the second of two games I won against tedd123. Though this game took a few more moves than the last one (32 moves this game vs 24 the previous) there was a lot of neat moves in this game that I felt worth of sharing as it worked out really well with lots of new strategy ideas. Feel free to comment and critique.

Now at the time I was very tempted to just advance pawn to h3 and force the black bishop to take the knight or retreat. However doubling up on pawns is not ideal so hence my decision to move the Queen

He has several options Nb4 is attacking the White Queen he can also potentially move to c2 forking the King and Rook his bishop is still threating Kf3 and his knight on the rim can easily jump back in and move to g3 for example and threaten the Rook.

My main motive was to draw the King out keep him from castling on the King side in the near future but also capture Nb4. Black can take the bishop or move his King. If he does capture the bishop I can easily put him back in check and capture the Knight and be in a good position possibly attack his knight on G4 by moving white pawn to e5
426,12,9,1Qb5+,b'r2q1b1r/pppkpBp1/3p3p/1Q5n/1n2P1b1/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Black decides not to take moves Kd7 white Qb5+

This would allow white to move Queen to F3 for the checkmate. Black did not take the bait moved pawn to a6

746,15,5,Kxe7,b'8/4k2p/4p3/2bp4/4pB2/4P2P/P3K1P1/8 w - -',I still had hopes of saving this ending though white has a passed pawn on a2 and a 2 to 1 majority on the other wing.
747,15,6,6Bxa7,b'8/B7/8/3p4/4p3/4P2k/4K3/8 b - -',This is won for white. The king has always to give way in these situations. I could have resigned now but played on a few moves.
748,15,7,6Bb4,b'8/8/4k3/3p4/1B1Kp3/4P3/8/8 b - -',As i said the king has to give way in these situations. White wins the last pawn in the same manner and queens his pawn.  VERY STRONG PLAY BY WHITE ESPECIALLY IN THE ENDING. WELL PLAYED.

755,16,6,Qxc2,b'8/p6p/6pk/8/P7/1P3Q1P/2q3PK/8 w - -',Ironically this is roughly the same position that the game ended up going so you got there in the end.  And as we both experienced this is a winning position for White.  Good game.

Time to deploy the queen.  The beauty here is that white will no longer be able to castle and the black queen can then traipse across the empty 5 rank to protect the h pawn.

Black hunts around for another high value target (HVT) and decides Ne3+ would work--provided Pf2 was trapped.  It would require several feints with the knight and Bf6 could cause much mischief.  But the first move is clearly the queen.
778,17,22,2Qf5,b'r1b2rk1/1p3p1p/p1np1Bp1/5q2/7P/8/P3BPQ1/R4K1R w - -',We should persuade white's black bishop to move.

Kg7 would discourage Bh6--and the white queen is in no position to offer assistance.  But with a three pawn advantage black could also frighten white with even trades.

936,22,48,d3,b'6k1/6r1/pn5r/1b4p1/1Pp3B1/P2p2PP/3R3K/2R5 w - -',and now? How to stop my pawns? I will pass whatever it takes as my rooks and my knight will be able to overtake the white rooks structure.

941,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am annotating this game for the benefit of my teammates in the Kingslayers.  Welcome all comments so we can improve together.
942,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sicilian defense standard stuff.
943,23,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Good to stop any knight or bishop excursions on the b5 square.
944,23,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',All pretty standard/book play thus far.
945,23,4,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',White is getting a little aggressive here threatening to do some action on the center.
946,23,5,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Good response from Black threatening b2 and getting some good counterplay on the center.
947,23,6,e5,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/4P1B1/3N1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Threatening his knight forcing the next play.  Qd2 is a more book play.  The other downside of this play is that it leaves a lone center pawn with no other pawns to lend support.  Lone center pawns can prove troublesome to protect and can sometimes cost the game down the line.
948,23,7,fxe5,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq2pn2/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now comes a moment of decision for Black.  There are a few options worth considering getting the knight to safety but the Queen has the best play.  White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn.
949,23,8,Qxb2,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PqP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Notice that the rook is not really threatened but the even if exf6 Black can do some unpleasant things with some check combos.  Black also gains a 1 pawn advantage.
950,23,9,1Bd2,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/4P3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I think that Na4 is a better response forcing the Queen to the a3 square but this move protects the knight and prepares for White to shoo away the Black queen.
951,23,10,1Nd5,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Moving the knight to safety and threatening a piece capture.  White has a few interesting options in response.
952,23,11,1Rb1,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq -',This move will force action on Black's queen.  A more interesting play is 11. Nxd5.  If Black doesn't retake with exd5 and does something like Qxd4 Nc7+ wins.
953,23,12,1Nxc3,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/2n5/PqPB2PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq -',An interesting exchange play that if seen through will rob white of castling.  However a retake is pretty much forced by this play since if 12. Bxc3 Qxc3+ wins a piece outright.
954,23,13,1Kxd1,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/8/PRPB2PP/3K1B1R b kq -',White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle but is only down 1 pawn so still a competitive game.
955,23,14,1Ba3,b'rnb1k2r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/b7/PRPB2PP/3K1B1R w kq -',An interesting move by Black.  The original goal was to get the bishop out to the c5 square but White could simply move the knight to b4 and cause the bishop to have to move again.  The anticipated move by White of Rb3 would block that path and allow the bishop to go to where it would do the most good c5.
956,23,15,Bc5,b'rnb1k2r/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R6/P1PB2PP/3K1B1R w kq -',Plan achieved.
957,23,16,1Be3,b'rnb1k2r/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R2B3/P1P3PP/3K1B1R b kq -',White either has to defend or move the knight.  I actually anticipated Nf3.
958,23,17,1Bd3,b'rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R1BB3/P1P3PP/3K3R b - -',Good placement for bishop.  When in doubt of where to place a bishop centralize.  Another possible good spot would be c4 as it would prevent Black from moving the f pawn.
959,23,18,1Nd7,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R1BB3/P1P3PP/3K3R w - -',Continuing on with the development of Black's pieces.
960,23,19,1Be4,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3NB3/1R2B3/P1P3PP/3K3R b - -',Nice way to add some pressure on the b pawn.  This move gave Black some positional choices to make.  Also it centralizes the LSB on the main diagonal so it can affect the maximum amount of squares.  I actually anticipated White moving a bishop to protect the e pawn.
961,23,20,1Nxe5,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1n3/3NB3/1R2B3/P1P3PP/3K3R w - -',Unprotected pawn becomes a snack.  Down 2 center pawns White needs a move to get equalization or he will have to sacrifice a piece to prevent promotion later on.
962,23,21,1Ke2,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1n3/3NB3/1R2B3/P1P1K1PP/7R b - -',Moving to get the King into the game to offer some protection to the DSB on e3.  It also prevents a back row rook check down the line threatening to lose another rook.  More importantly it will allow White to marry up his rooks on the b file.
963,23,22,1Bxd4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/4n3/3bB3/1R2B3/P1P1K1PP/7R w - -',Black's final development is seriously hampered by the LSB on e4 so in order to uncomplicate things I decided to trade pieces allowing more flexibility in maneuvering.
964,23,23,1Bxd4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/4n3/3BB3/1R6/P1P1K1PP/7R b - -',White now has a 2 bishop to 1 advantage in a fairly open board.  If White can keep both bishops it will make things more challenging for Black.
965,23,24,1Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/8/3BB3/1R6/P1P1K1PP/7R w - -',Another option considered here was f5 to chase away the LSB on e4 but ultimately decided to offer White a trade and a split of my a/b pawns.
966,23,25,2Bb6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/pBn1p3/8/4B3/1R6/P1P1K1PP/7R b - -',And White denied Black.  A good rule of thumb when you're down in points is to trade pawns and not pieces (unless you're trading up!).  With this move White further complicates Black's position and Black has no easy way to extract the bishop.  Nice move.
967,23,26,2e5,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/pBn5/4p3/4B3/1R6/P1P1K1PP/7R w - -',Recognizing I'm not getting much action for the bishop otherwise time to open a diagonal and put that piece to work.  Also threatening f5 once the LSB is on e6.
968,23,27,2a4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/pBn5/4p3/P3B3/1R6/2P1K1PP/7R b - a3',Looking to make a permanent post for the DSB and if Black wants to trade for it will reconnect White's pawns in the process.  Nice.
969,23,28,2Be6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/pBn1b3/4p3/P3B3/1R6/2P1K1PP/7R w - -',Tempo move and completed development of Black's pieces (only 21 moves in!)
970,23,29,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1p3ppp/pBn1b3/4p3/P3B3/8/1RP1K1PP/7R w - -',Preventing a piece exchange that would break up the a/b pawn chain.
971,23,30,2c3,b'2r2rk1/1p3ppp/pBn1b3/4p3/P3B3/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R b - -',Uncertain of the utility of this move.  I would connect the rooks on the b file and then try to eat Black's b pawn.
972,23,31,2f5,b'2r2rk1/1p4pp/pBn1b3/4pp2/P3B3/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R w - f6',Now that the LSB is on e6 no check counterplay is offered to White.
973,23,32,2Bxc6,b'2r2rk1/1p4pp/pBB1b3/4pp2/P7/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R b - -',I would have probably have looked at Bd3 or Bc2 to preserve the 2 bishop advantage.
974,23,33,2Rxc6,b'5rk1/1p4pp/pBr1b3/4pp2/P7/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R w - -',Now there is a different color bishop end game.  Black will need a pair of pawns to promote.
975,23,34,2Ba5,b'5rk1/1p4pp/p1r1b3/B3pp2/P7/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R b - -',Better to connect the rooks on the b file.  The bishop on b6 did not need to be moved yet. 
976,23,35,2Bc4+,b'5rk1/1p4pp/p1r5/B3pp2/P1b5/2P5/1R2K1PP/7R w - -',Looking for some room to start marching the pawns down.  Also looking to get the LSB into the game more forcefully.  Also looking for a perch for the bishop with some follow on pawn action.  There can be no better perch for a bishop than bearing down on the diagonal to protect a pawn for promotion.
977,23,36,b5,b'5rk1/6pp/p1r5/Bp2pp2/P1b5/2P5/1R3KPP/7R w - b6',Removing the threat of a rook battery going after the b7 pawn.
978,23,37,2Bb4,b'5rk1/6pp/p1r5/1p2pp2/PBb5/2P5/1R3KPP/7R b - -',Equally good post for White's bishop complicating Black's life a bit as well.
979,23,38,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/6pp/p1r5/1p2pp2/PBb5/2P5/1R3KPP/7R w - -',Rooks love open files.
980,23,39,2axb5,b'3r2k1/6pp/p1r5/1P2pp2/1Bb5/2P5/1R3KPP/7R b - -',There were a few choices to be made for Black at this point.  I could take with the pawn and completely block the c pawn or take with the bishop.  My decision point was that if I took with the pawn I now have another open file into my backside.  To limit White's options at counterplay I opted to take with the bishop.  Later on this could cause me problems if White put a rook behind the c pawn to start pushing down the board.
981,23,40,e4,b'3r2k1/6pp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2P5/1R3KPP/4R3 w - -',White will need to get his bishop into play to stop those pawns.  A 4 on 2 advantage will require a piece sacrifice to prevent a promotion with proper play from Black.
982,23,41,3g3,b'3r2k1/6pp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2P3P1/1R3K1P/4R3 b - -',Good instincts.  Hoping to break up the e/f pawn chain.
983,23,42,3Rd3,b'6k1/6pp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/1R3K1P/4R3 w - -',Besides blocking off the file it also allows for more support to push pawns.
984,23,43,3Rc2,b'6k1/6pp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R2K1P/4R3 b - -',Uncertain what White is going for here.  I would consider getting your rooks connected to forced away that Black rook on d3.
985,23,44,3Rf3+,b'6k1/6pp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2P2rP1/2R2K1P/4R3 w - -',The hope here is to get the other rook up on d3 but the White bishop on b4 is making that a multi-move endeavor.
986,23,45,3Rd1,b'8/5kpp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2P2rP1/2R3KP/3R4 b - -',Rooks do love open files but a dangerous move as it puts both rooks on a diagonal of the LSB of Black.  However Black's rook is totally in the way.
987,23,46,3Rd3,b'8/5kpp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R3KP/3R4 w - -',Another move I considered for black was Rc7 to protect against the d7 check.  Ultimately I decided against it since it was too easy for Black to move the bishop around.
988,23,47,3Rf1,b'8/5kpp/p1r5/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R3KP/5R2 b - -',"So many tantalizing ""almost"" options for Black.  Alas there was no obvious way I could see to trade a bishop for a rook.  Rg3+ could be captured with a pawn which would make it a poor trade."
989,23,48,3g6,b'8/5k1p/p1r3p1/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R3KP/5R2 w - -',Protecting the f pawn from a rook incursion.
990,23,49,3Rfc1,b'8/5k1p/p1r3p1/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R3KP/2R5 b - -',Finally White has doubled the rooks looking to start a pawn push on c.
991,23,50,3Ke6,b'8/7p/p1r1k1p1/1b3p2/1B2p3/2Pr2P1/2R3KP/2R5 w - -',Looking to get the king into the game for offense/defense.
992,23,51,3c4,b'8/7p/p1r1k1p1/1b3p2/1BP1p3/3r2P1/2R3KP/2R5 b - -',The long awaited pawn push.  I have only one place to go.
993,23,52,3Rc2c3,b'8/7p/p1r1k1p1/5p2/bBP1p3/2Rr2P1/6KP/2R5 b - -',Sadly White couldn't bring a rook to the a file.
994,23,53,3Rxc3,b'8/7p/p1r1k1p1/5p2/bBP1p3/2r3P1/6KP/2R5 w - -',Forcing the trade.
995,23,54,3Rxc3,b'8/7p/p1r1k1p1/5p2/bBP1p3/2R3P1/6KP/8 b - -',Now White is still down 2 pawns with diminishing piece options for counterplay.  
996,23,55,3Rb6,b'8/7p/pr2k1p1/5p2/bBP1p3/2R3P1/6KP/8 w - -',Hoping to trade rooks and go into a fairly decisive endgame.
997,23,56,3Ba3,b'8/7p/pr2k1p1/5p2/b1P1p3/B1R3P1/6KP/8 b - -',White obliges.  A better option was Bc5 and escape.
998,23,57,3Rb3,b'8/7p/p3k1p1/5p2/b1P1p3/BrR3P1/6KP/8 w - -',No choice for White now.
999,23,58,Kd5,b'8/7p/p5p1/2Pk1p2/4p3/Bb4P1/6KP/8 w - -',Now White is stuck on the c pawn and has to defend against 2 pawns down the center.  White needs a blunder from Black to survive this one.
1000,23,59,Ba4,b'8/7p/p5p1/2Pk1p2/b3p3/B5P1/5K1P/8 w - -',To allow the king to get into the game and still guard the c6 square...
1001,23,60,4Ke3,b'8/7p/p5p1/2Pk1p2/b3p3/B3K1P1/7P/8 b - -',A decent move to get the king involved but regardless coming 2 against 4 pawns is tough.
1002,23,61,4Bc6,b'8/7p/p1b3p1/2Pk1p2/4p3/B3K1P1/7P/8 w - -',An important move to block the c pawn from advancing  as well as provide support to the f/e pawn march.
1003,23,62,4Kd2,b'8/7p/p1b3p1/2Pk1p2/4p3/B5P1/3K3P/8 b - -',Allowing my king to advance and get the square.  It might be best to give up the c-pawn and get the DSB involved.
1004,23,63,g5,b'8/7p/p1b5/2P2pp1/3kp3/B5PP/3K4/8 w - -',in preparation for f4.
1005,23,64,gxf4,b'8/7p/p1b5/2P5/3kpp2/B6P/4K3/8 w - -',Now White is in serious trouble.  His remaining pawns are blocked and two connected passed pawns spells doom.
1006,23,65,e3+,b'8/7p/p1b5/2P5/3k1p2/B3p2P/5K2/8 w - -',Notice how the earlier bishop placement to c6 allows for a smoother advancement seriously blocking White's potential responses.
1007,23,66,Bb5+,b'8/7p/p7/1bP5/3k4/B3p2P/5p2/5K2 w - -',"And that as they say is the ballgame.  Interestingly enough if the pawns on f/e were not connected it would be very very hard to win this game as opposite color bishops can block all sorts of promotions without the connected pawns to force the issue.

White should have given up the c pawn and instead brought his bishop into play.  The end likely would not have changed but everyone makes mistakes.  A lone king against two connected pawns a king and a bishop is impossible to beat."

Now I would have preferred for him g6 instead since black's duty is to put a barrier to white. g6 doesn't leave much of a hole in h6 because Wdsb is blocked and through the 7th rank now black will be able to get some action with Rf7 (defending the N which can't move or Qh8#).

I choose this one instead with the idea that ""opening columns will be in my favour anyway"". So I was inviting him to ""come on please..."" :-). I'll allow him to move but I hold a pressure that will allow my lsb to get to h5... and curtains for black if he doesn't come up with something (which he did). "

1137,28,6,Nxc3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2nP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black makes this move to give his opponent an ugly pawn formation.  The isolated a pawn and the doubled c pawns are liabilities that can provide dividends in the end game.

Knowing how to close out an ending like this is chess 201.  (Chess goes all the way to infinity.)  The idea is to close off the King's squares push him to the edge get your own King in opposition.  As follows.
1154,28,23,Rb4,b'8/8/8/4K3/1r6/8/2k5/8 w - -',White can no longer move to ranks 1-4.  Important to note:  Black did not try for a check.

Where there is a pawn conflict it will be between White's pawns on the 4th rank and Black's on the 6th pushing the center of gravity of the battle towards Black's king. Black's pieces provide no help to him; they are perhaps a little more coordinated than White's but not much. White still has an extra knight and his pieces are more centrally located.
1176,30,6,Bxd4,b'r3k2r/ppp1p2p/3p2p1/q7/3b1PP1/2NP3P/PPPBQ3/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black trying to put some pressure on White whose position is generally pretty well defended.
1177,30,7,1Rb1,b'r3k2r/ppp1p2p/3pq1p1/8/2PbNPP1/3P3P/PP1BQ3/1R2K2R b Kkq -',The previous two moves White has ignored the Black threat on his b-pawn which might have become an avenue for Black to breach White's defense and weaken the back rank. Black's attack has seriously been blunted as the queen is back on the sixth rank and the bishop is little more than an obstacle White is working around. The move up of the c-pawn essentially made the b- and a-pawns irrelevant by breaking the chain with them but White decides to consolidate his gains for a move.
1178,30,8,1Kxe2,b'r3k2r/ppp1p2p/6p1/3p2N1/2Pb1PP1/3P3P/PP1BK3/1R5R b kq -',White has opened up the middle with his attack on the queen and now this game is largely a flanking action. White has a definite advantage but Black has some possibilities to scratch and claw for a draw. He might be well off to try to start trading away pieces.

It is understandable to try to get the rook into the game but capturing the pawn on c4 will open up White's middle and allow some attacks on White's king which is a bit out in the open. Had Black castled kingside it would have allowed White to capture Black's pawn on d5 forcing Black to scramble some more. However the knight fork to come is more devastating and White correctly goes for material.
1180,30,10,2dxc4,b'2kr4/ppp1p2p/6p1/8/2Pb1PP1/7P/PP1BK3/1R5R b - -',The dust has settled with White up a piece and the exchange. Black has few credible attacks here and essentially no hope of winning. However his pawns might offer some hope of clogging up the middle and getting a draw from this mess. Moving a pawn to the 5th rank would blunt White's attack.
1181,30,11,2Bh8,b'2kr3b/ppp1p2p/6p1/8/2P2PP1/7P/PP1BK3/1R5R w - -',Entirely useless except to open up Black's rook. Now White has every reason to try to exchange pieces to get Black's rook off the board the only really dangerous piece left.
1182,30,12,cxd4,b'2kr4/pp2p2p/6p1/8/2Pp1PP1/7P/PP2K3/1R1R4 w - -',Two rooks against one with Black's pawn caught between his rook and White's. What a mess.
1183,30,13,Rf8,b'5r2/ppk1p2p/6p1/8/2Pp1PP1/3R3P/PP2K3/3R4 w - -',Black scrambling as he has little recourse to defend the d-pawn. However as long as he's going to lose it he might as well get rid of his useless e-pawn as well which is clogging up his rook's mobility. A move to e4 would prompt a capture from White's f-pawn. At that point White's king has only a capturable pawn between the Black rook and him and the f-file is open as well. 
1184,30,14,3Rd4d7+,b'5r2/ppkR3p/8/4p1p1/2P2PP1/5K1P/PP6/3R4 b - -',Black's whole problem this game has been falling in love with one piece to take without noticing White's spatial advantage. Here he has pressed White into a mistake although eventually of little consequence. White himself ought to understand that he's going to lose the f-pawn no matter what and shift his rook to e4 where he could force Black into a pawn capture which just protects White's king some more. Instead White wants to gobble up some of Black's pawns. That's fine but leaves White vulnerable to a rook capture of the f-pawn letting Black into White's backfield and complicating matters somewhat.
1185,30,15,gxf4,b'5r2/pp5R/1k6/4p3/2P2pP1/5K1P/PP6/3R4 w - -',But Black misses the opportunity and might as well resign now. As this is an online game however what do we expect?
1186,30,16,Rd4+,b'8/pR6/8/4R3/2kr1KP1/7P/PP6/8 w - -',Another grave mistake allowing White to force a rook trade.
1187,30,17,3a4,b'8/1R6/8/p7/P1k1K1P1/7P/1P6/8 b - a3',Now White's rook is quite well-positioned preventing Black's king from getting to either of White's pawns on the left side of the board. White could probably win with this material but gets lazy and just decides to promote to win.
1188,30,18,Kb1,b'6Q1/8/8/pR3K2/P7/7P/1P6/1k6 w - -',White's pawn on b2 is becoming something for Black's king to maneuver around.
1189,30,19,5h5,b'8/8/8/p4K1P/P7/1RQ5/1P6/1k6 b - -',White decides to promote again possibly worried about accidentally creating a stalemate situation.
1190,30,20,5Ra3#,b'8/8/8/p4K2/P7/R1Q5/kP6/7Q b - -',Black just did everything wrong. White's play is aggressive with his pawns all game but generally he just waits for Black to tie himself into ribbons and lose. Perhaps that aggression created Black's stupid play.
1191,31,0,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P2B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',A good and original (for me) answer to the Icelandic. Black can't play Nbd7 because of dxe. Black doesn't have to but has to think about how to develop properly.

1415,34,119,6c4,b'8/8/5k2/7r/2p5/2K1n3/8/8 w - -',protected by the knight
1416,34,120,6Kd2,b'8/8/5k2/7r/2p5/4n3/3K4/8 b - -',and he attacks my knight
1417,34,121,6Nf1+,b'8/8/5k2/7r/2p5/8/3K4/5n2 w - -',RUN!!! 
1418,34,122,6Kc3,b'8/8/5k2/7r/2p5/2K5/8/5n2 b - -',he goes back to attacking me
1419,34,123,6Rh4,b'8/8/5k2/8/2p4r/2K5/8/5n2 w - -',and to make sure i did not get a forced draw i moved my castle
1420,34,124,6Kc2,b'8/8/5k2/8/2p4r/8/2K5/5n2 b - -',he moves
1421,34,125,6Ke5,b'8/8/8/4k3/2p4r/8/2K5/5n2 w - -',i move up to protect my pawn
1422,34,126,6Kc3,b'8/8/8/4k3/2p4r/2K5/8/5n2 b - -',stopping me from going to d4
1423,34,127,6Kd5,b'8/8/8/3k4/2p4r/2K5/8/5n2 w - -',it will take a move longer for my queen
1424,34,128,6Kc2,b'8/8/8/3k4/2p4r/8/2K5/5n2 b - -',he moves
1425,34,129,6Kd4,b'8/8/8/8/2pk3r/8/2K5/5n2 w - -',i move
1426,34,130,6Kc1,b'8/8/8/8/2pk3r/8/8/2K2n2 b - -',the next moves are quite boring 
1427,34,131,6c3,b'8/8/8/8/3k3r/2p5/8/2K2n2 w - -',as i try to get a queen and he tries to stop me

1429,34,133,6Rh2+,b'8/8/8/8/3k4/2p5/2K4r/5n2 w - -',have to be careful of stalemate
1430,34,134,6Kc1,b'8/8/8/8/3k4/2p5/7r/2K2n2 b - -',as he is locked dawn in 1 row
1431,34,135,6Kd3,b'8/8/8/8/8/2pk4/7r/2K2n2 w - -',i move king up
1432,34,136,6Kd1,b'8/8/8/8/8/2pk4/7r/3K1n2 b - -',he does one of two moves possible
1433,34,137,6c2+,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/2p4r/3K1n2 w - -',and of course he will not move to e1 which will give me checkmate in 1
1434,34,138,7Kc1,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/2p4r/2K2n2 b - -',but he moves there
1435,34,139,7Rd2,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/2pr4/2K2n2 w - -',with only one possible move
1436,34,140,7Kb2,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/1Kpr4/5n2 b - -',i get ready for queen
1437,34,141,7Rd1,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/1Kp5/3r1n2 w - -',3 possible places
1438,34,142,7Kb3,b'8/8/8/8/8/1K1k4/2p5/3r1n2 b - -',and i have a......

1440,34,144,7Ka2,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/K7/2qr1n2 b - -',the end is close... closer then i actually saw at first
1441,34,145,7Qa1+,b'8/8/8/8/8/3k4/K7/q2r1n2 w - -',he has to move to b3
1442,34,146,7Kb3,b'8/8/8/8/8/1K1k4/8/q2r1n2 b - -',as said
1443,34,147,7Rb1#,b'8/8/8/8/8/1K1k4/8/qr3n2 w - -',Well i never saw that coming when i started to play him. a very good opponent ans it was fun to play him... feel free to comment and i hope you found this fun
