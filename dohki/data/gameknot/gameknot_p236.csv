10,0,10,1Nf5,b'r1b1k1r1/p4p1p/2p1pB2/5N2/5q2/2P5/P1P2PPb/R2QR2K b q -',I thought over this for a long time and saw the move Nf5. Pawn cant take the knight due to pin and Queen cant because of Qd8++. I couldnt calculate completely the variation of Blacks Bd7 everything else looked good for white. Fortunately Ms. Hannah didnt play Bd7.

47,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here White uses unusual move orders to beat the Scandanavian Defense.
48,2,1,a3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This begins a strategy of slowly constricting Black and limiting options with flexible moves that offer transpositional possibilities to favorable positions according to the DB.
49,2,2,h3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/8/P1N4P/1PPP1PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Here White prevents Bg4 but also lays the groundwork for an attack on the kingside.
50,2,3,b4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/1P6/P1N4P/2PP1PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq b3',Drives away the queen and prepares for an attack on the other wing as well as possibly fianchettoing the bishop.

54,2,7,e6,b'rn2kb1r/ppq2pp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/1PPP2P1/P6P/5PB1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',At this point White is in good shape. Wherever Black puts the king White is prepared to attack with powerful bishops.
55,2,8,1Nd3,b'r3k2r/ppqnbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/1PPP1PP1/P2N3P/6B1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White decides to retreat the Knight. He wants to save it for the attack once Black decides which side to castle on.
56,2,9,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppqnbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/1PPP1PP1/P2N3P/6B1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',...0-0-0?! While 0-0 is risky and this is common in the Scandanavian Defense main line here White can rapidly bring every piece and a pawn storm to bear on the Black king.
57,2,10,2Qxc6,b'1qk3rr/p1bn1pp1/2Q1pn1p/8/3P1PP1/P2NB2P/6B1/R4RK1 b - -',White has opened up the King.

60,3,0,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Hier dacht ik nog even aan spektakel varianten met 6…..Pxe4. 7. Pxe4 d5. Dat wordt dan weerlegd door 8. Lb5 +. Daarom moet a6 eerst en Gerard haalt met zijn volgende zet de mogelijkheid Pxe4 er definitief uit. Dus ga ik op de normale Siciliaanse manier door met ontwikkelen
61,3,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',De beslissing wat te doen met de stukken op de damevleugel nog even uitstellen
62,3,2,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Ik had gedacht dat hij lang zou rocheren. Op Chess base kon ik 19 partijen met de korte rochade vinden waarvan wit er flink wat won! 
63,3,3,Na5,b'2r2rk1/1pqbbppp/p2ppn2/n7/4P3/1BN1BP2/PPPQN1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Nu is het voor zwart heel lastig om een goede voortzetting te vinden daarom heb ik hier wel een minuut of 10-15 bedenktijd gebruikt. Belangrijk is meestal het goed op tijd plaatsen van de opstoot d6-d5. Ik besluit daarom de loper op b3 af te ruilen. Wat voor alternatieven heeft zwart? Tfd8? Pe5? h6? De laatste vond ik griezelig want misschien kan wit wel gewoon offeren op h6.
64,3,4,Nc4,b'2r2rk1/1pqbbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2n1P3/1BN2P2/PPPQN1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Achteraf lijkt 14.   Pxb3 15. cxb3 Kh8 me beter voor zwart het wint een tempo ten opzichte van Pc4. Nu neemt wit het initiatief
65,3,5,gxf6,b'2r2rk1/1p1bbp1p/p2ppp2/8/2q1P3/2N2P2/PPPQN1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',vooral geen Lxf6 vanwege Dxd6
66,3,6,Bc6,b'2r2r1k/1p2bp1p/p1bppp2/8/2q1PP2/2N2R2/PPPQN1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Deze zet was erg naar mijn zin. 
67,3,7,Rfg8,b'2r3rk/1p2bp1p/p1bppp2/8/2qNPP2/2N2R2/PPPQ2PP/3R2K1 w - -',Dd4 lijkt mij een goed alternatief voor wit. Een heel dwingende zet ik moet dan weer lang gaan nadenken of ik de dame wil afruilen en zo ja hoe. 
68,3,8,bxc6,b'2r3rk/4bp1p/p1pppp2/8/2q1PP2/2N2R2/PPPQ2PP/3R2K1 w - -',bxc6 in verband met de opstoot d6-d5 die gaat mogelijk worden en geeft mij de nodige ruimte
69,3,9,d5,b'2r3rk/4bp1p/p1p1pp2/2qp4/4PP2/1PN2R2/P1PQ2PP/3R3K w - -',Daar is-ie dan eindelijk. Df2 lijkt mij ipv Kh1 een solide alternatief voor wit maar wel erg richting remise bijvoorbeeld 22. Df2 d5 23 exd5 cxd5 24. Dxc5 Lxc5. Heel ander spel
70,3,10,Rcg8,b'6rk/4bp1p/p1p1pp2/2qp1P2/4P1r1/1PN4R/P1PQ2PP/3R3K w - -',Gerard gaf hier zelf i.p.v f5 g3 als degelijker alternatief aan. Dat is voor wit minder riskant maar zet wel Th3 geïsoleerd
71,3,11,Rg4xg2,b'6rk/4bp1p/p1p1pp2/2qp1P2/4P3/1PN4R/P1P1Q1rP/3R3K w - -',"Hier kwam het nodige rekenwerk aan te pas. Gerards’ voortzetting heb ik gezien maar ook

 Ook  26. Dxg2 Txg2 27. Kxg2 d4! 28. Thd3 dxc3 29. Td7 lijkt mij uiteindelijk winnend

76,3,16,Qe5,b'2k4r/4b3/p1p1Pp2/4q3/8/1P6/P2R3P/3Q3K w - -',Dd3 lijkt lastiger maar dan volgt Dd5 met ruil

De afloop is bekend. Mijn f-pion sneuvelde op het veld van eer de 2 resterende witte pionnen gingen er af wit moest zijn toren geven om promotie van de a-pion tegen te gaan. De c-pion werd een prachtige dame met ideale maten en met nog 1 minuut op de klok bleef Rijs in klas 2.

79,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I think I initiated this challenge against a higher-rated player with a higher score in D1. I adopted a suitably conservative opening move.
80,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',An interesting move order.  I have vague memories of having been stuffed by White after playing this after 3. cxd5 Nxd5 but I can't believe it's actually wrong.  As White I continue to take a conservative approach.
81,4,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Develops a piece and piles pressure on d5.

85,4,6,Bh4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White prefers to keep the 2 bishops if possible.  He needn't worry about Black's KN exposing an attack on the Bh4 because Black can't take any White pieces in the process of revealing the attack and White can merely swap on e7.
86,4,7,b6,b'r1bqk2r/p2nbpp1/1pp1pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black prepares to fianchetto his q-side B.  His pawn structure already restricts this B.  White's Bishops are much better because of their greater freedom of movement and influence on the position.

150,5,24,3Kd2,b'8/5kp1/8/R7/5P1p/P1r5/3K2PP/8 b - -',Keeping black off of c2. How hard can it be? White is up by two pawns and has a passed pawn. Each side only has a rook to play with. Should be an easy endgame right?
151,5,25,3Kc2,b'8/5kp1/8/R7/5P1p/Pr6/2K3PP/8 b - -',This is where I realize white is in trouble. I want to advance the a-pawn and promote him but my rook is in the way. How I wish that rook were on a2 right now. White cannot force a promotion on the kingside with the pawn majority because black's king is over there. In fact if I'm not careful that king could destroy white's pawns if allowed to - fortunately white's rook dominates the 5th rank shutting out the black king. White's king cannot run to the support of the kingside because if he makes one move away from b2 he let's black play Rb2 followed by Rxg2 and Rxh2 and then he'll have no kingside to support. In fact I worried that black might be able to play for a 3-move-repeat draw by bouncing back and forth between b3 and e3. Up by two pawns and I'm faced with a draw?
152,5,26,3Kd1,b'8/5kp1/8/R7/5P1p/P3r3/6PP/3K4 b - -',As I feared.
153,5,27,3a4,b'8/5kp1/8/R7/P4P1p/1r6/6PP/3K4 b - -',OK no point in letting him have his draw. Besides I think I found a way to get a queen. I spent lots of time here. If this had been a timed game in a tournament room my time would surely have run out. Well I would have spent less time and gone with my gut much sooner. I decide to let black have his slice of heaven back.
154,5,28,4Rg5,b'8/5kp1/8/6R1/P4P1p/8/1r4PP/3K4 b - -',The rook defends g2 and is defended by a pawn so black cannot dislodge the rook with anything other than his own rook such as from g6 which would be suicide - his king is too far away to stop the white a-pawn from promoting.
155,5,29,4a5,b'8/6p1/5k2/P5R1/5P1p/8/1r4PP/3K4 b - -',Never have 4 little steps looked so far. The pawn takes the first step.
156,5,30,4h3,b'8/6p1/5k2/P5R1/5P1p/7P/r5P1/3K4 b - -',Black attacks the pawn but he's well enough defended. Of course now the pawn can't take those last three steps that are looking even farther away now. Black might want to break up the white kingside by playing his pawn to h3 so white prevents it.
157,5,31,4Kc1,b'8/8/5kp1/P5R1/5P1p/7P/r5P1/2K5 b - -',Now it's time to get the white king involved in driving black out of heaven.

159,5,33,4Rg4,b'8/8/5kp1/P7/5rRp/7P/1K4P1/8 b - -',The key move. I have to give 45. Rg4! an exclamation. Black cannot get back behind the white pawn now no matter what he tries.
160,5,34,4Ra4,b'8/8/5kp1/P4r2/R6p/7P/1K4P1/8 b - -',Back on move 37 I was wishing my rook were on a2. Well wish granted (somewhat) since a4 is now just as good. Well almost as good since on a2 the rook could prevent black's next two moves.
161,5,35,4Kb3,b'8/8/5kp1/P7/R6p/1K5P/5rP1/8 b - -',By moving to the third rank white prevents black from simply playing 47. ... Rf3+ and then playing for perpetual checks or 3-move-repeats. Further it's possible that later in the game there may become a power struggle over the a8 square and white will need his king to help.
162,5,36,4a6,b'8/8/P4kp1/8/R6p/1K5P/6r1/8 b - -',Now white has sacrificed two pawns but at least the little guy on a2 knows he can finally put on the royal gown and reign as queen even if only for a moment. Black should not have captured with 47. ... Rxg2?. Instead 47. ... Re2 48. ... Re8 and 49. ... Ra8 to block the white pawn and initiate that power struggle over a8 that I previously mentioned. Capturing with 47. ... Rxg2? loses the tempo he needs to reach a8 before the pawn promotes.
163,5,37,4Kc4,b'8/8/P4kp1/8/R1K4p/6rP/8/8 b - -',Same as with 47. Kb3 again white prevents black from simply putting him right back in check with 49. ... Rg4+. Black must play 49. ... Re3 and 50. ... Re8 so he can capture white's queen on a8.
164,5,38,5a7,b'8/P7/5kp1/8/R1K4p/7r/8/8 b - -',49. ... Rxh3?? seals black's doom. It's doubtful that black could survive a King+rook+pawn vs. King+2 pawns endgame but it's far more doubtful that he can survive once white's queen promotes without immediate recapture. Moving his rook immediately to e8 was his only chance at a draw. It's interesting to note that six moves ago white had a two pawn material advantage and now black has a one pawn advantage. Three white pawns gave their lives so their king could find a new queen.
165,5,39,5a8=Q,b'Q7/8/5kp1/8/R1K4p/5r2/8/8 b - -',See? The royal gown looks good on him!
166,5,40,5Kd3,b'Q7/8/5kp1/8/R4r1p/3K4/8/8 b - -',52. Kd3 once again prevents black from putting the white king in check. All black can do is play some kind of waiting move and if he moves his rook off of the 4th rank he will lose his pawn to 53. Rxh4. Nothing for it but to trade rooks.

This is the point that black resigned.

Firstly since the game is currently closed in the middle a knight is slightly more valuable than a bishop. Trading a bishop for a knight in a closed game is a good trade. However White is trading an active bishop for a passive knight: Black's knight had no central squares to move to. Secondly (and much more importantly) White is trading his good bishop for Black's knight. Since White's pawn structure is locked down on the light squares White's dark-colored bishop is much more valuable than his light-colored bishop since it isn't blocked by his pawns. The game will soon open up leaving White with one weak bishop and Black with a powerful bishop pair. Better would have been more development such as 7. Nc3 or 7. Be2.

The move is moot though because White has left the b4 square unprotected. Black's knight can move there to dislodge White's knight.

Black will want to move his pawns to a5 and b6 to lock in White's bishop and stop all counterplay on the queen-side.

Black's pawns on b4 and a5 have shut in White's queen bishop and rook on the queen-side. Black's f-file rook is important to the protection of the king-side where White still has good attacking chances. Naturally the a-file rook is the correct rook to move. Black is slightly ahead heading into the middlegame.

Ng5 offers a trade Black's bad bishop (which is locked in by his pawns) for White's active knight. This is a bad trade for White who is already suffering from weakened dark squares. The knight would have been useful protecting those. Much better would have been 16. h4 followed by 17. h5! and 18. h6! damaging Black's king-side defenses and opening up his king.

Things will open up on the king-side soon (the king-side pawns are the only ones White can push) and the king will be safer closer to his pawns. King safety is important since all of the action is on the king-side.

Also if the f7 square comes under attack the pawn push b7-b6 will open up the Black queen's defense of that square.

White never recovers from this blunder.

A knight anywhere on the edge of the board only had 4 moves (2 if it's in a corner or 3 if it's next to a corner). In this case three of the black knight's moves are blocked by black pawns and the fourth b3 is instant death by axb3.

This isn't the safest castle position but I feel I've inflicted enough damage to black's queenside to make it unlikely he can launch a scary attack against the exposed king. The rook on d1 might create a pin on the d5 pawn if things work out right which may allow the white bishop on f1 to capture on f4 in a few moves.

I did see the threat while I was waiting for black's 16th move but it was too late to stop it then. But black played 16. ...

Bd4 was the best move here but I thought I may want that bishop home to help with the defense something it was unable to do from b6.

I feel my bishop is more crucial to my defense than the knight and I would like to play the pawn to f3 to drive off black's knight so capturing the pawn at e5 with the white knight seems the best option.
251,8,19,2Ng4,b'2r5/1b3pp1/3bk2p/3p4/3Bn1N1/3BP3/P4PPP/K4R1R b - -',Because I still want f3 open for a pawn.

I looked long and hard at taking this pawn (at least for two whole minutes). I knew better. The white DSB needs to remain on the long diagonal a1-h8 to prevent black from getting his DSB on it. The damage black can do with two bishops and a rook against white's lone king is scary. I thought about it then decided I could get away with it. It was the wrong choice. White should have played 27. Bd4 or simply left the bishop on g7 for now and brought his rooks into a more active role.
254,8,22,2Rfc1,b'2r5/8/3bk2B/3b4/4p1p1/4P3/P4PPP/K1R4R b - -',Another mistake. White must get his DSB on that long diagonal.

256,8,24,3h3,b'1r6/8/4k2B/4b3/4p1p1/4P2P/b1K2PP1/2R4R b - -',One dead pawn. If nothing else black has traded his isolated h-pawn for white's passed a-pawn thanks to white's dubious 27. Bxh6? which makes that an even pawn trade but black isn't done. White's bishop on h6 is useless as a defender and black still has three pieces attacking the exposed white king. White intends to run his king all the way to the kingside and I feel he can get there so I play 31. h3? looking to create a passed pawn. But I think 31. Kd1 was called for here to prevent the immediate loss of more material.
257,8,25,3Kd1,b'8/8/4k2B/4b3/4p3/4P2P/br3P2/2RK3R b - -',Too late.
258,8,26,3Rxf2,b'8/8/4k2B/4b3/4p3/4P2P/b4r2/2RK3R w - -',Another white pawn falls. Now that 27. Bxh6? (with sloppy white moves that followed) has cost white two pawns rather than gaining one. And now white has no kingside shelter to run to.
259,8,27,3Bf4,b'8/8/4k3/4b3/4pB2/4P2P/b4r2/2RK3R b - -',Finally white makes a good move of sorts. Black has all kinds of scary threats and white really wants to play Rh2 forcing the trade of rooks. after 34. ... Bxf4 35. exf4 Rxf4 white will have lost a third pawn thanks to 27. Bxh6? but now at least black's attack will have been adequately blunted to allow white room to breathe. However white will only be up by the exchange not much to bank on for winning an otherwise even endgame. Worse white's only pawn is on the h-file very difficult to promote while black's pawn is centrally located on the e-file much easier to promote. To whites benefit black's only bishop does not control either promotion square. White might be able to work out a win but there's a good chance this game will end in a draw.
260,8,28,3Rh2,b'8/8/4kb2/8/4pB2/4P2P/b4r1R/2RK4 b - -',I am not sure why black chose not to win white's e-pawn as previously noted with 34. Bxf4. Whtie capitalizes by skewering the black rook to his bishop thinking this forces the exchange of rooks which would greatly favor white.
261,8,29,3Ke1,b'8/8/4kb2/8/4pB2/1b2P2P/5r1R/2R1K3 b - -',Black found his zwischenzug moving his bishop with check which breaks the skewer and avoids the rook exchange.
262,8,30,3Ke2,b'8/8/4kb2/8/4pB2/1b2Pr1P/4K2R/2R5 b - -',Black's rook has nowhere to go. Trapped. White wants to attack it with a rook and force the exchange but not with 38. Rf1?? which loses a rook to 38. ... Bc4+! and not 38. Rf2? which loses a pawn to 38. ... Rxh3. Well at least the black rook is stuck for now.
263,8,31,3h4,b'8/4b3/4k3/8/4pB1P/1b2Pr2/4K2R/2R5 b - -',Might as well see what this passed pawn can do.
264,8,32,3Rc6,b'8/8/2Rbk3/8/4pB1P/1b2Pr2/4K2R/8 b - -',Black blundered with 38. ... Bd6??. Clearly he wanted to exchange bishops with white freeing his rook in the process. But white's reply wins the black bishop for free.
265,8,33,4Rd4+,b'8/8/8/8/2kRpB1P/1b2Pr2/4K2R/8 b - -',To win the last black pawn.
266,8,34,4Rxe4,b'8/8/8/8/4RB1P/1bk1Pr2/4K2R/8 b - -',And now black's rook is cooked. It has nowhere to run. Black could try 42. ... Bc4+? hoping to drive off white's king but white would reply 43. Rxc4+ Kxc4 44. Kxf3 and win easily with a rook bishop and two pawns against black's lone king.
267,8,35,4exf4,b'8/8/8/8/4RP1P/1bk5/4K2R/8 b - -',Black at least sold his doomed rook for the price of a bishop. Now the endgame is brutally easy. Advance the passed pawns look for an opportunity to trade a rook for the last black bishop then either promote a pawn and checkmate with queen+rook or simply go for the king+rook checkmate without promoting any pawns. Black took this opportunity to resign.

I think I was not enthused with either Qxb4 or an eventual Rxb4 as a matter of his moving forces in to threaten the King. 25. a3 was my way of securing that pawn chain because it was way harder for him to assault the 3rd rank than the 4th. I think I just wanted to put this out of my mind and focus on King defense. Of course I had to try to make sure there were no observable threats to the King over the next 2-3 moves.

The other thing I was very worried about was an attack on my now vulnerable a pawn from his Queen.

344,12,26,3Qf7,b'8/2P1nQpk/p5r1/1p2pp2/1P6/P4P1B/4q2P/5R1K b - -',Trying to force his knight from preventing c8. He thankfully does not appear to have a way to defend his knight. Notice my bishop is effectively limited to h3 or g2. Qxf1# is the threat.
345,12,27,4Qxf5,b'2n5/2P3pk/p5r1/1p2pQ2/1P6/P4P1B/4q2P/5R1K b - -',I felt some relieve at this point pinning the rook and threatening the Knight.

348,12,30,4Rg1,b'2Q5/6pk/p5r1/1p2p3/1P6/P4P2/4q1BP/6RK b - -',Without the Knight I felt it safer to huddle in while I find a way to extricate myself out of this tight(er) spot.
349,12,31,4Qf2,b'2Q5/6pk/p5r1/1p2p3/1P6/P4P2/5qBP/6RK w - -',I'm not sure what he intended to do with this move. I was almost certain he was gonna attack my queen-side pawns.
350,12,32,4Qf5,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p2pQ2/1P6/P4P2/5qBP/6RK b - -',Re-establish the pin while threatening the e pawn so I can buy myself some room.

352,12,34,4Rf1,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p2pQ2/1P1q4/P4P2/6BP/5R1K b - -',His Queen's current position prevents me from moving the bishop to some more useful position with Qxg1#.
353,12,35,4Qh4,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p2pQ2/1P5q/P4P2/6BP/5R1K w - -',He might be trying to unpin the Rook (takes more than 1 move I think) and then go for Rh6.
354,12,36,4Qxe5,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p2Q3/1P5q/P4P2/6BP/5R1K b - -',I figured I'd unpin it for him and remove that annoying pawn and protecting the h pawn at the same time so even if he did Rh6 it would not achieve anything. My key worry now was denying him a chance at perpetual check.
355,12,37,4Qe4,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p6/1Pq1Q3/P4P2/6BP/5R1K b - -',Re-establishing the pin and offering an exchange of queens. I was trying to simplify and allow my bishop to be useful again. Notice his queen-side pawns are on white squares which are perfect targets.
356,12,38,4Qxe4,b'8/6pk/p5r1/1p6/1P2q3/P4P2/6BP/5R1K w - -',He takes the exchange. I think he's counting on reducing me to just the King and Bishop and hence a draw.
357,12,39,a5,b'8/6pk/6r1/pp6/1P2P3/P7/6BP/5R1K w - -',This was unexpected. I was expecting Rc6 or Rd6 to get to a position to attack the a pawn. The offered exchange is really a trap. It is MUCH better for me if I made him take the exchange than for me to take this exchange right now.
358,12,40,5e5,b'8/6pk/6r1/pp2P3/1P6/P7/6BP/5R1K b - -',I had to check that it was safe to push this pawn. There were two goals the first was to get it close enough to be a threat and the second was to free my bishop.
359,12,41,5axb4,b'8/6pk/6r1/1p2P3/1p6/P7/6BP/5R1K w - -',Again unexpected. I had to think very carefully at this point. He had opened himself up for a Rook for Bishop exchange and I had to make sure his advanced b pawn was not going to be a problem.
360,12,42,Kxg6,b'8/6p1/6k1/1p2P3/8/p7/7P/5R1K w - -',In the end it was clear. His King was prevented from reaching my e pawn. The e pawn promotes LATER than the a pawn BUT puts him in check allowing me to recapture the queen with no loss. Any attempt to move his King to deny this check would then make his promotion later than mine also losing the game.
361,12,43,5e6,b'8/6p1/4P1k1/1p6/8/p7/7P/5R1K b - -',Given how seriously pressured I was in the middle of this game and also in another game where I played the Queen's Gambit I do not think I'd be trying this opening for a while ...

371,14,1,dxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Black tries the Charlick Gambit and unsound opening for black that is known for combative positions and opening traps but careful play by white should easily refute this opening. White's reply is main line.

Nc6 which can lead to the Englund Gambit) is stronger for black. The text move 2. ... Bc5 is not in my resources. White's 3. Nf3 is the recommended reply to black's main line (2. ...

374,14,4,e3,b'r2qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1pn5/2b1P3/5B2/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White opens the diagonal for his LSB (Light Squared Bishop) prepares to castle in a couple more moves. The pawn seems a little passive on e3 and might better have been moved to e4 instead where it would block the fianchettoed black bishop on the long diagonal though it might become tenuous to defend it on e4.
375,14,5,Bd3,b'r2qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p6/n1b1P3/5B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Black weakly moves his knight to the edge of the board where it has nothing to do and no safe squares to move to other than back to c6. While it does open his bishop's diagonal black may have been better served by 6. ... Nc6e7 followed soon by Ng6 where it can threaten the white bishop on f4 and can support a kingside attack. White responds with a fairly weak bishop move. It does clear the way for the kngside castle but it doesn't really threaten anything. It may have been better placed on f4 but black's 6. ... Na5 contests that square. Another line of play might have been 7. a3 threatening 8. b4 to fork black's two pieces. Just the threat of the fork should cause black to retreat one or both pieces gaining tempo for white.
376,14,6,O-O,b'r3k1nr/pbppqppp/1p6/n1b1P3/5B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Black develops his queen perhaps prematurely. This is the standard 3rd move for black in the Charlick Gambit deferred here by 4 moves. It would be stronger if black's knight were still on c6 to exert pressure on the white pawn at e5 (black could remove a defender with Bxf3 then Nxe5 wins a pawn). As is the queen blocks the black knight on g8 from it's only reasonable development and she gains little by way of an attack from e7.

380,14,10,1Qd2,b'r3k1nr/pb2qpp1/1p1p4/nN5p/8/3BPN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',It might have been fun to try 12. Nh4?! which is not a good move in and of itself but if black plays carelessly such as with a safe-looking developing move such as 12. ... Nf6 white can win at least a pawn with 13.

Black can avoid that checkmate but he cannot save his queen. The move as played 12. Qd2 is somewhat passive and allows black to open up the white castle with 12. ... Bxf3.
381,14,11,1Be4,b'r3k1nr/p3qpp1/1p1p4/nN6/4B2p/4PP2/PPPQ1P1P/R4RK1 b kq -',White's king is in a bit of danger. Black is getting close to winning with Qg5+ and h3 and Qg2#. It's not locked yet but white better take precautions. The move as played 14. Be4 does little to prevent this impending mate but it does allow white to play f4 at some time letting the bishop cover g2. It also threatens black's rook but with a possible checkmate in sight black doesn't have to save that rook right away - in fact he could use it as bait. Worse while the bishop was on e3 it protected white's far-flung knight at b5 but now it does not and black has a simple fork to threaten to win that knight (though the need to save his rook on a8 will give the knight time to escape).

Qe7 threatens the knight twice and pins it to the undefended white queen 18. Rad1 Rh6 and now white's knight must fall. Accordingly 16. Nc3 or 16. Nd4 were called for here or even Nc7+. As a silver lining the white rook on g1 skewers the black queen to the pawn on g7 and after she moves white can win the g7 pawn.

If black exchanges queens white replies with exd4 and undoubles his pawns consolidating his superior pawn structure even more.

I respond by pinning the white knight on f3 to the rook on h1.

429,17,18,Rxc4,b'5rk1/p3Qppp/8/4p3/1Pr3P1/q2PK2P/4B3/5R2 w - -',Instead white defends his pawn on b4. That's OK white wasn't going to capture that one first anyway. Since the pawn on d3 is pinned to the king the black rook can safely capture on c4 putting a double threat on b4.
430,17,19,Qxb4+,b'5rk1/p3Qppp/8/4p3/1qr3P1/3P3P/3KB3/5R2 w - -',White broke the pin and black gobbled the b4 pawn creating a passed pawn for black on the a-file. 25. Qxb4+! is much better than the passive 25. Rxb4 since it gives black a royal fork (forking the white king and queen). This forces white to trade queens with 26. Qxb4 Rxb4 leaving black ahead by the exchange and two pawns with a passed pawn for black on a7 and an isolated pawn for white on d3. At this point black can coast in for an easy endgame but white failed to respond before the 3-day time limit expired so black won due to time out. The white player had less than 1/2 of 1% of all his games end due to time out so I assume the time out wasn't deliberate.

A small point of interest: it took 46 days to play 32 moves and at least three of the moves here at the end (black's 28th 29th and 32nd) were entered as conditional moves. During that time my GK rating increased 197 points (including 5 from this win) and I'm now rated 253 higher than my opponent a 255 point swing. A lot can happen in a month and a half.

So I quite suddenly became aggressive taking a pawn and threatening to clean up his pawns (as long as I felt I had the tempo). Clearing the pawns there has the added advantage of increasing my b3 Rook's capabilities (currently very limited thanks to my pawn chain).

655,26,23,2Nf3,b'r5k1/p1p2rp1/4Q3/4Ppq1/3P4/1RP2NP1/P3n2P/5R1K b - -',Attacking the queen was a tertiary concern. The primary was getting my knight the hell out of there and my secondary concern was continuing to provide shelter to the King.
656,26,24,2Qh5,b'r5k1/p1p2rp1/4Q3/4Pp1q/3P4/1RP2NP1/P3n2P/5R1K w - -',25. ...Nxg3 forks King and Rook and gains a free pawn while he was at it. I had to prevent it.

658,26,26,2Qc4,b'r5k1/p1p2rp1/7q/4P3/2QP1pP1/1RP2N2/P3n1KP/5R2 b - -',I was considering the Queen exchange until I noticed his Knight really had nowhere to go if threatened! Hence my earlier comment about Ne2 being a mistake. The best part was I could do this while still maintaining that Rook pin.
659,26,27,2Ng3,b'r5k1/p1p2rp1/7q/4P3/2QP1pP1/1RP2Nn1/P5KP/5R2 w - -',I don't think this was the best response. Looking at this position now I think he could be way better off passively giving up the Knight. 27. Qc4g5 secures his lone pawn even in the face of the Rook pin. 28. Qxe2 which I may not do under the hypothetical circumstances unpins his Rook and gives him time for 28. Qxe2Kg7 29. ...Rh8. I think that if not stopped would give his queen power over the h file to start tearing my King's defenses apart.
660,26,28,Qf4+,b'r5k1/p1p2rp1/8/4P3/2QP1qP1/1RP2NK1/P7/5R2 w - -',From this point on I had to be extremely careful about allowing the conditions for perpetual check (given how 2 of my major pieces are more or less isolated from the action King-side).
661,26,29,g6,b'r5k1/p1p2r2/6p1/4P3/2QP1qP1/1RP2N1K/P7/5R2 w - -',I had hoped for 30. Kh3Qh6+ 31. Nh4 making him lose the rook ... Now the (very serious) threat was 31. ...Kg7 32. ...Rh8+.

Note how the pin was making it just slightly tougher for me to properly reason about the threat posed by the Queen at various positions along the f file. What were moves normally too dangerous to make given a Queen + Rook had to be given a second look since the Rook cannot move.
663,26,31,Raf8,b'5rk1/p1p2r2/6pq/4P3/2QP2P1/1RP3K1/P6N/5R2 w - -',Again the pin prevented this move from being far more dangerous than it would normally have been.
664,26,32,3Rb7,b'5rk1/pRp2r2/6pq/4P3/2QP2P1/2P3K1/P6N/5R2 b - -',I knew he only had one option left after Raf8 ... he was going to unpin his King and the only way he could do it was via Kg7. Anything else loses him a rook. I calculated I had time for Rb7 followed by Rxc7 which because of my Queen's protection (I got lucky again) granted me a 2nd pin on his King's intended position along the 7th row.
665,26,33,3Rxf8+,b'5Rk1/p1Q5/6pq/4P3/3P2P1/2P3K1/P6N/8 b - -',I had to think long and hard about 36. Rxf8+. I had to make sure I had sufficient time to move my queen into a more effective position (note that it cannot reach back to cover the King if some perpetual check scenario was possible).
666,26,34,3Qd8+,b'3Q1k2/p7/6pq/4P3/3P2P1/2P3K1/P6N/8 b - -',Kf7 or Kg7 both left him vulnerable for the followup Qf6+ which gave me the peace of mind I needed (not 100% though) regarding the King.
667,26,35,3e6,b'6k1/p7/4PQpq/8/3P2P1/2P3K1/P6N/8 b - -',Again I had to ensure it was safe to start pushing pawns.

669,26,37,4Qxc3,b'6k1/p7/4PQp1/8/3P2P1/2q2NK1/P7/8 w - -',Opens another diagonal to attack the King from c7. Thankfully Kh3 is the eventual appropriate response.

In this game I want to show an unusual attack of the semi-slav game the Shabalov attack. At 6th a very usual continuation is the meran variation with 6.Bd3 dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 and now white must choice were to put his bishop (d3 o e2) with a loss of time. To avoid this I prefer to play 6.Qc2 which is the anti-meran variation.
672,27,1,g4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/2PP2P1/2N1PN2/PPQ2P1P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq g3',Here we are! 7.g4 is the very aggressive Shabalov attack introduced by Alexander Shabalov in the first 90's. Of course this is more powerful in fast gamesbecause of the surprise effect. The main idea is that after the sacrifice of the pawn (that in some cases can be token back) white can make a strong attack with the rook on the open g column so black must be very carefull as we will see with an example in the next comment. If the black decides to not take the pawn white has gained some space and has the possibility of playing g4-g5 attacking the knight.
673,27,2,dxc4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/8/2pP2P1/2N1PN2/PPQ2P1P/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Black decides to not take the pawn. Another way to decline the offer is the aggressive 7...e5 which I think is the best for black. If 7...Nxg4 a possible continuation could be 8.Rg1 Nxh2 9.Nxh2 Bxh2 10.Rxg7 and now the best possibilities for black are Bd6 Bc7 Qf6 or  if he doesn't want to give back the pawn Qh4 and Nf8. In the game Shabalov - Mephisto(computer) we had a mistake with 10...h6? trying to save the pawn... 11.f4! trapping the bishop and then the game continued with 11...Qh4+ 12.Qf2 Qxf2+ 13.Kxf2 Nf6 14.Rg2 h5 15.Rxh2 Ng4+ 16.Kg3 Nxh2 17.Kxh2 with a good advantage for white.

The advantage of this move order for Black is that Black avoids several anti-Dutch variations and White's dark-squared bishop is not developed outside the pawn chain as in the main game.

19. a4... the queen can go to c6 allowing him some freedom and leaves c3.
19. Ne5. Prevents the black queen to go to c6 and BxN favours me in theory. It's ok apparently. But he has Nf5 to which I should play Rd1. This is the reason 19. Nd4 is slightly inferior. But Ne5 allows Qb5. Let's look for surprising and not natural moves: 
19 g4... prevents Nf5. But again loses c3.

White was presumably planning to retreat the Q to b2 anyway so there's not much point attacking it.  g7 was a better square for the B than f8 though there is an opportunity to redevelop it to d6 or c5 whence it can attack the K directly.

So I'm not convinced of the rectitude of my play over the last few moves.  This does however leave me with a strong unopposed dsb.  I remember reading somewhere that it is more important to consider what is left on the board after an exchange than what is being given up in the exchange (eg good N for bad B doesn't matter if afterwards Black's good B is even better).

893,36,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi all! This is a game between me and my long-standing Arch-Rival who has only recently come to GameKnot. He is playing White and before this game the score between us is 1.5-1.5. So there's a lot to play for...
894,36,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play the move for Black which points the way to main line Queen Pawn openings such as the King's Indian Nimzo-Indian or Benoni. The benefit of this move is that Black has more or less complete freedom to choose the opening.
895,36,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Pointing the way to a King's Indian Defence.
896,36,3,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This solid move my Arch-Rival told me is often played to bypass the sharp play and the theoretical lines of the King's Indian Defence also blunting Black's fianchettoed bishop. Annoying for me as I am more comfortable with main line KID.
897,36,4,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Both sides develop in nearly symmetrical fashion.

903,36,10,Rxd7,b'6k1/pp1r1pbp/2p3p1/5b2/5B2/2P3P1/PP3PBP/4R1K1 w - -',I recapture my queen. I had yes foreseen lines with 21.Re8+ Bf8 22.Rb8 Rd2 which I think are narrowly advantageous for me.

This is exactly as GM Yasser Seirawan describes this combination in ""Winning Chess Combinations"" and I fell right for it! No! An embarrassing loss against my ARCH-RIVAL!"
905,36,12,Bh3,b'4Rbk1/pp3p1p/2p3pB/8/8/2P3Pb/PP3P1P/3r1BK1 w - -',I may as well replicate the attack. There's nothing else I can do.

914,38,2,1h4,b'r1b1k2r/1pqnbp2/p2ppp1p/8/3NPPPP/2N2Q2/PPP5/2KR1B1R b kq h3',Looks logical.  My book memory runs out here and I can't find my book on this variation...

Black also has to beware of White's sacrificial opportunities with Nc3-d5 or Bxb5 or Nxb5.  When White's Q moved to f3 this inhibited ...b5 because of the potential for revealed attacks on the Ra8 and the ris of moving Black's B onto b7 if unprotected hence 8...Qc7 which I always play automatically against Qf3 in this and similar lines.

I was ready to resign on resumption.  Imagine my surprise when White beat me to it and resigned!  Play might continue along one of these lines: (18. Rxd3 e5 19. fxe5 (19. Nc3 exd4 20. Qxd4 bxc3 
21. Rxc3 Qd7 22. Rg1 Rg8 23. Rxc8  Bxc8 24. f5 Rxg4 25. Bh3 Rxg1  26. Qxg1) 19. .. fxe5 ( 19. .. Qxc2  20. Nxc2) 20. Nc3 {anything to block the mating attack on c2} exd4 21. Qxd4 O-O 22. Rd2 bxc3 23. bxc3 Qxc3 24. Qxc3 Rxc3 {when Black should be able to make his extra piece count})"

922,39,1,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Scandanavian Variation.

924,39,3,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My reference suggests 4. Nf3 and has no coverage of 4. f4.
925,39,4,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp1b1pp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Really just winging it. I think I played this one since the GameKnot DB recommended it. I was eager to castle kingside and get my rook on the open f-file or if white beats me to it just put my rook on f8 and oppose white's claim of the open file. 6. ... Bb4  just seems to fail after 7. c3 and then white chases my bishop back to b6 (or a7 with an extra move or two) or back to e7 so I just played to e7 to begin with. In retrospect since f6 is covered by white's pawn at e5 I might have wanted to play my king's knight here first.
926,39,5,Bd7,b'r2qk1nr/pppbb1pp/2n1p3/1B1pP3/3P4/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Breaking the pin.

928,39,7,Be7,b'r2qk1nr/pppbb1pp/2n1p3/1B1pP3/P2P4/5NP1/1PP4P/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In my head I had seen 9. ... Bg4 but when it came time to actually play it I quickly realized that would cost me a piece so back to e7 I go. I'm starting to feel cramped and miserable and it's looking like white's having all the fun.

932,39,11,Bxc6,b'r2qk2r/1pp1n1p1/p1b1p2p/3pP3/Pb1P3P/2NQ1NP1/1PP5/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Ahh a bit of breathing room. I'm thinking Qd7 0-0-0 and bringing a rook to f8 comes next but this is when the timeout happened again just when it was getting good. 39 days for 14 moves - this game could have gone on for months...
