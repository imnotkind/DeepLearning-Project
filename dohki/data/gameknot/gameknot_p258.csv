0,0,0,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"(Game info on previous page) Hmmm... Already a !? type move.  I'd like to hear your motivation for this as I notice you play it quite regularly in your other games as well.  Comes under the category of irregular openings.  I said at the time that I can't really criticize it because if the Caro-Kann is a solid opening for Black it must be even better with a move in hand.  
However as the WT player in an unrated game surely you must be going for the win and this doesn't hold many attacking chances for you. 
Also you mustn't try and run before you can walk: It's recommended to learn  to attack before you may consider adopting a more defensive/positional approach.  Therefore I recommend sticking to e4 for now.  it will help with all the basic opening principles: development control of the centre etc.. and also it gives you a chance to practice tactics.  It is recommended right up until expert level to devour as much tactics as you can (within a balanced approach of openings endgames and strategy) and the game won't be as tactically based using this type of opening.

Perhaps over-preparing.  That DSB will be entombed throughout the majority of the game and d4 straight away would have been better IMO (sticking to Caro Kann mainline but of course with a degree more initiative).  Your DSB will be locked in the pawn chain for some time but after d4 you would have had the chance of soon Bf4 and then e3 can be played with the advantage of 2 'good' Bishops. "

Let's pause and compare the 2 positions:  My Bishops are free to develop with lots of open lines and my pieces can come rushing out with ease.  While your position is comparatively cramped and as proved in the game developing will not be easy.  On the upside your pawn structure is solid and could be a potential endgame advantage."

However it does nothing to change the course of the game.  This is an almost certain win from here and it weakens the light squares around your King which probably can't be helped.  (11.

I want to squeeze everything out of the position however so I'm taking time to try and shut down any last embers of a Q-Side counter-attack that are still there and trap both Bishops in the corner of the board and virtually out of play.  Also note that it's move 11 and while my attack is building your whole Q-Side still sits undeveloped!  Another thing to note is that where there would normally be a defensive Knight on f3 covering h2 there is a hole.  So it's desperation but maybe you would want to play Re1 and Nf1 although a downside is it cuts off your King's escape square and is giving in to passive defense.  Not a lot else you can do however but sit wait and hope I slip up somewhere down the line.  Another plan for me was Nh6 and my Bishop can come to g4 and then f4 or straight to h3 and completely undermine the K-Side light squares also either Knight can take up a tasty and powerful square on g4: piling on the pressure.

However I couldn't pass up the opportunity of likely putting my Bishop on the powerful f1-a6 diagonal cutting almost straight through the centre of the board and opening up a discovered attack on your Rook (although flawed as you will see in my comment on his next move).  Although I didn't play it for the cheap trick of 14. bxa4 15. Bxa4(say) bxf1 that I didn't expect you to fall for.  I also wanted to provoke you into the 'easy way out' of 14. a5 (I would have just moved my Bishop back to c8 and carried on my assault on your King's position) which I expected you to do and it was a good sign that you didn't: because when complications arise most beginners resort to closing the position; probably because the calculation required in an open position they think is too hard for them and it seems to be easy on the brain to get into a 'safe' closed game (I'm not dissing a closed game just many weak players like it for the wrong reasons).  
Here you realized correctly that you must try and create complications on the Q-Side and open it up at all costs.  Unfortunately you blundered when you had a combination staring you in the face which does cause me a few complications..  Try to find it you'll be kicking yourself!..  "

At this point the game is won anyway so it doesn't particularly matter.  Also what chess engines say is not necessarily gospel.  Don't for one second believe that they are always right.

This is the sort of endgame that you need to know you can't just figure it out.  It may seem like a daunting task but if you know how it's done and have practiced it it's actually quite manageable; but remember because of the 50 moves rule I have to get it done before or on White's 101st move.  There is almost a 'system' in doing it which I'll take you through.  But before we start here's a few key points you need to know about this.  
You will ONLY be able to force mate in the same coloured corner squares as your Bishop FACT.  In this case mine is Dark Squared so I need to force him to either h8 or a1.  But how do I achieve this seeming impossible task? 1st things 1st I'll need to force him to the edge of the board.  It doesn't even matter if at 1st I can only force him to a8 or h1 I will have achieved step 1 of the puzzle.  Step 1 is quite easy you can just figure this bit out.  Just keep cutting off his King's escape squares and soon he'll be forced onto the edge.  Oh.. and another thing my Knight and Bishop will better co-ordinate when kept close and on the same colour squares: that way my knight can control the squares my Bishop is unable to and so they will together control more squares collectively.  
So anyway.. I'll get you on the edge and we'll take it from there (no comments are needed until then you can see basically what's happening). "

Stick to these squares and you can't go wrong.  The same formula would apply if we had a symmetrical position but two ranks down on the 6th rank or even 4 ranks down on the 8th.  
I should run through an important line which I don't need to worry about in this position but try to if you can imagine this piece arrangement:  WK on a6 N on b6 BK on

Well these are the kind of core endgames that just need to be learned.  Imagine you are at a tournament and you have completely outplayed your opponent and you get into a specialist type endgame such as this and you don't know how to finish him off!  And learning it also teaches good Bishop and Knight co-ordination. 
Anyway thanks for faxander for the game and although it wasn't perfect I do notice you are gradually improving.  Keep it up!  make a note of the good and  
bad moves you made during the game and try to improve on them for future games.  For more help on this and other endgames there are some great videos on youtube.com

179,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I had played this opponent many times and know that he is a very tactical player so I opened with d4.
180,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The previous day out of pure curiosity I had asked my opponent if he had ever played the Albin Counter-Gambit knowing that he loves gambits and he replied that he had. I had actually studied it recently unfortunately I didn't remember much beyond White's first five moves.
181,6,2,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This was as far as I was comfortable; after this I started spending a lot of time on my moves.
182,6,3,a3,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4Pb2/2Pp4/P4NP1/1P2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Bg2 is more common here and probably is a better move but I did not feel comfortable with 6.Bg2 Nb4 7.Na3 d3!? which IM Andrew Martin admits is unclear.
183,6,4,Bg5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/4PbB1/2Pp4/P4NP1/1P2PP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Bg2 may still have been more to the point. This moves seems to help Black develop more than White.
184,6,5,h6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1npp1/2n4p/4PbB1/2Pp4/P4NP1/1P2PP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Practically forcing me to give up the bishop pair.
185,6,6,d3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2n4p/4Pb2/2P5/P2p1NP1/1P2PPBP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',As expected. If I take the pawn castling will be very difficult to me and my king will be stuck in the center against an attack specialist with the bishop pair. 
186,6,7,1e3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2n4p/4Pb2/2P5/P2pPNP1/1P3PBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I decided I would try to pressure Black's d-pawn and prove that it had overextended itself.
187,6,8,f6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1p1/2n2p1p/4Pb2/2P5/P2pPNP1/1P3PBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',While this move is often thematic in the Albin here the weakening of the a2-g8 diagonal seems to lose a lot of time and allow White to recapture the initiative. Black tends to play this before he has castled the next few moves show why.
188,6,9,Kh8,b'r2q1r1k/ppp1b1pb/2n2p1p/3BP3/2P4N/P2pP1P1/1P3P1P/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',At this point I had 1 hour and 24 minutes remaining and my opponent still had 1 hour and 50 minutes left.
189,6,10,1e6,b'r2q1r1k/ppp1b1pb/2n1Pp1p/3B4/2P4N/P2pP1P1/1P3P1P/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Now I also have a pawn on the 6th rank! Although I knew that this pawn would be weak I felt more comfortable with this move given that I was already a pawn up and I knew it would disrupt Black's development. Often a pawn on the sixth rank can have an effect on the opponent's position similar to dividing his position in two and that was one of my major goals here.
190,6,11,c6,b'r2q1r1k/pp2b1pb/2p1Pp1p/3Bn3/2P5/P2pPNP1/1P3P1P/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Unfortunately I cannot keep my strong bishop on d5 which had protected the e6 pawn and limited the scope of the Black queen on the d-file.
191,6,12,1Bg2,b'r2q1r1k/pp2b1pb/2p1P2p/4p3/2P5/P2pP1P1/1P3PBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',I realized that Black would then play e4 to make the d3 pawn a connected passed pawn which forced me to change my plan - I would now attack the e4 pawn hoping that once it left the board the d3 pawn would be fatally weakened.
192,6,13,1Nc3,b'r2q1r1k/pp2b1pb/2p1P2p/8/2P1p3/P1NpP1P1/1P3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The pawn cannot be maintained.
193,6,14,Re8,b'r2qr2k/pR4pb/2p1P2p/8/2P1N3/b2pP1P1/5PBP/3Q1RK1 w - -',So the smoke has cleared. I have a rook on the powerful 7th rank I still have an extra pawn but the pawn on e6 is going to fall at any moment and Black has an outside passed pawn that could prove very difficult to stop especially in an endgame where the rook on a8 protects it. I thought for awhile here and decided that my top priority needed to be stopping the d3 pawn.
194,6,15,2Qa4,b'r2qr2k/pR4pb/2p1P2p/8/Q1P1N3/b2pP1P1/5PBP/5RK1 b - -',Accordingly I cleared the d1 square for the rook hoping to do so with tempo in the event the attacked bishop move. This didn't end up happening because of Black's next move.
195,6,16,Bxe4,b'r2q3k/pR4p1/2p1r2p/8/2P1b3/Q2pP1P1/5PBP/5RK1 w - -',"I was okay with this because Black's bishop had been supporting the d3 pawn.
At this point I had 59 minutes remaining and Black still had 1 hour and 40 minutes."
196,6,17,2Qc3,b'r2q3k/pR4p1/2p4p/8/2P1r3/2QpP1P1/5P1P/5RK1 b - -',This mating threat forces Black to move either his rook or queen into a defensive position to defend g7. At this point I could tell that my opponent was getting frustrated with his position.
197,6,18,2Qxd3,b'r6k/p3q1p1/2p4p/8/2P5/3QP1P1/5P1P/5RK1 b - -',One passed pawn down another still to go.
198,6,19,Rd2,b'7k/p5p1/2p4p/2q5/2P5/1Q2P1P1/3r1PKP/5R2 w - -',Grabbing the pawn gave Black a lot of counterplay. I was starting to get nervous here. Although I was up a pawn Black had an outside passed pawn that I wasn't sure how to stop and his pieces were very aggressively placed aiming straight at my king.
199,6,20,3Qb8+,b'1Q5k/p5p1/2p4p/2q5/2P5/4P1P1/3r1PKP/5R2 b - -',I saw that I likely had a perpetual check with Qb8  Kh7 Qb1  and I was seriously considering taking it here. I decided to make the first move of it so I could see what to do from there.
200,6,21,3Kh7,b'1Q6/p5pk/2p4p/2q5/2P5/4P1P1/3r1PKP/5R2 w - -',The first day of the tournament had been rough for me and I had lost about 20 rating points. I realized that I could get them all back if I won this game and I could also tell that my opponent did not like his position. I decided to keep pressing.
201,6,22,Rd6,b'8/p5pk/2pr3p/2q5/2P2Q2/4P1P1/5PKP/5R2 w - -',I think it was here that my opponent offered me a draw. I had already made the decision to play for a win and I was sticking with it. I knew that my opponent did not offer draws in positions he thought were unclear so this must have meant that he was nervous. I realized I had the psychological edge here.
202,6,23,3Rb1,b'6k1/p5p1/2pr3p/2q5/2P1Q3/4P1P1/5PKP/1R6 b - -',Qe7 followed by Rd1 would have won material here.
203,6,24,3Qg6,b'5rk1/pR4p1/2p3Qp/2q5/2P5/4P1P1/5PKP/8 b - -',At this point I had 38 minutes remaining. Although I had a lot of pressure on the critical g7 square Black was starting to develop threats of his own against the f3 square.
204,6,25,3Qxc6,b'5rk1/pR4p1/2Q4p/4q3/2P5/4P1P1/5PKP/8 b - -',After the game my opponent told me that taking this pawn gave him a lot of counterplay. However I saw no better move. I didn't like 36.Qxa7 because of the reply ...Qb2.
205,6,26,3Kh8,b'5r1k/pR4p1/2Q4p/4q3/2P5/4P1P1/5PKP/8 w - -',White now needs to be careful not to leave the rook undefended and lose it to ...Qe4 .
206,6,27,3f3,b'5r1k/pR4p1/5q1p/3Q4/2P5/4PPP1/6KP/8 b - -',I now had 32 minutes left.
207,6,28,3Qd4,b'5r1k/pR4p1/7p/8/2PQ4/2q1PPP1/6KP/8 b - -',I do not believe that I could have won this game without these mate threats. I was now trying to trade queens and make my pawn plus count but with so many checks available to Black this was not so easy of a task.
208,6,29,4Qe2,b'5r1k/pR4p1/7p/8/2P2P2/4P1PK/4Q2P/q7 b - -',I thought that ...Qf1  Kh4 g5 was threatened here not realizing that after Kh5 Black has no queen checks.
209,6,30,Rg8,b'6rk/pR4p1/4q2p/8/2P2P2/4P1P1/1Q4KP/8 w - -',Finally defending against the mate threat but also taking away an escape square from the queen which becomes important later.
210,6,31,4Qd5,b'6rk/pR4p1/2q4p/3Q4/2P2P2/4P1P1/6KP/8 b - -',24 minutes remaining.
211,6,32,h5,b'6rk/p3R1p1/8/3Q3p/2P2P2/4P1PK/4q2P/8 w - -',This move seems to fatally weaken Black.
212,6,33,5Ra7,b'6rk/R5p1/8/p5Qp/2P2P2/4P1PK/4q2P/8 b - -',Black's queen cannot leave the h5 pawn undefended upon pain of mate and Qf1  leads simply to Kh4. I was down to 20 minutes here (while my opponent had 57 minutes) but I felt like I was finally almost out of the woods.
213,6,34,5Qxh5+,b'4r2k/6p1/8/R6Q/2P2P2/4PqPK/7P/8 b - -',Now that the queens are coming off the rest should be simple for White. Black resigned here and I breathed a sigh of relief.
214,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was a standard game between two lowish-ranked players (although this was my first game so my rank may not be representative). I (fish613 playing black) annotated this game not because it's a stunning game although it does exemplify how strategic advantages can be thrown away with tactical mistakes but simply because I wanted to develop my own thoughts and thinking process further. Comments are welcome - I'm sure I've missed a lot.
215,7,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Hence 4 dxe5 Nxe4. 3... d6 is an alternative but blocks the bishop. 3... exd4 4 Nxd4 Nxd4 5 Qxd4 is equal on material but white has an iron grip on the centre.
216,7,2,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',The natural response pinning the knight.
217,7,3,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Guards against the threat of 5... Nxe4
218,7,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The white square bishop is still unmoved. 5... b6 leading to Bb7 would have been a viable option.
219,7,5,Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4N1B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',At this point white has a very powerful centre and is ahead on development.
220,7,6,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4N1B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',6... Nxe5 7 dxe5 leaves white with a strong centre.
221,7,7,Nxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2Np1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Forces the exchange and weakens the black queen-side pawns after the next move.
222,7,8,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2pp1b2/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Allows castling as well as attacking f7.
223,7,9,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/p1p1qppp/2pp1b2/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',9... Re8 aiming at attacking the king is negated by castling next move and Rb8 is too easily blocked to be useful. This prepares for 10... Be6 hoping to exchange bishops without weakening the king side pawn structure.
224,7,10,cxd5,b'r4rk1/p1p1qppp/3pbb2/3p4/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black gets rid of his doubled pawn but white is able to keep a pawn in a useful position.
225,7,11,1Re1,b'r4rk1/p1p1qppp/3p1b2/3P1b2/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',White tries to force open the e-file for his rook.
226,7,12,1Be5,b'r4rk1/p1p1qppp/3p4/3Pbb2/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',The advantage of this move is that it blocks the e-file and also attacks h2. Black's bishop pair is now a useful threat against the castled king. The game is wide open at this point with white one pawn ahead.
227,7,13,1Rac1,b'r4rk1/p1p1qppp/3p4/3Pb3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPb2PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Anticipated by black. White retains the tempo and restricts black's bishop but black has snatched a pawn for nothing.
228,7,14,1g6,b'r4rk1/p1p1qp1p/3p2p1/3Pb3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPb2PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',This move and my next few show my biggest weakness - I tend not to think through moves properly. The gambit is an interesting one but I had hoped for a mate after Qxe1#. I missed the fact that white could move the king off the back rank. This move g6 was intended to let white think I had made a mistake and move the c-rook off the back rank.
229,7,15,Qxe1,b'r4rk1/p1p2p1p/3p2p1/3P4/2B5/2N2Q2/PPR2PPK/4q3 w - -',This is the point at which my plan fell through. I had made the game level on points but left myself with a worse position.
230,7,16,1Re2,b'r4rk1/p1p2p1p/3p2p1/3P4/2B5/2N2Q2/PP2RPPK/4q3 b - -',A good move by white leaving him with control of the e-file.
231,7,17,2Rxe8,b'4Rrk1/p1p2p1p/3p2p1/1N1P4/2B5/5Q2/PP3PPK/2q5 b - -',White exchanges rooks but relinquishes the e-file - a factor which by chance becomes significant a few moves later.
232,7,18,2Qb3,b'6k1/p1N2p1p/3p2p1/3Pr3/2B5/1Q6/PP3PPK/2q5 b - -',? The white queen has left her defence of the white king and some interesting tactical opportunities for black are available. Black has 3 lines of attack two of which are fairly unpromising but the third can easily lead to mate if white does not take care. The unpromising lines are Rh5  and Qh6 . Black played Qf4 .
233,7,19,2Qf4+,b'6k1/p1N2p1p/3p2p1/3Pr3/2B2q2/1Q6/PP3PPK/8 w - -',23 g3 Qxf2  24 Kh1 Re1  25 Bf1 Rxf1# 24 Kh3 Rh5 25 Kg4 Qf5#; 23 Kh3 Rh5#; 23 Kh1 Re1 24 Bf1 Rxf1# are all big pluses for black. White can defend with 23 Qg3 allowing black to swap queens or with 23 Kg1 which is more difficult for black to checkmate (due to defence of f1 a key spot in some of the variations shown).
234,7,20,2g3,b'6k1/p1N2p1p/3p2p1/3Pr3/2B2q2/1Q4P1/PP3P1K/8 b - -',In the end white missed those options and played a move (quite quickly as he happened to be online at the time) that allows a decisive black attack.
235,7,21,Qf5#,b'6k1/p1N2p1p/3p2p1/3P1q1r/2B3K1/1Q4P1/PP6/8 w - -',"I won by checkmate.
As far as move 13 both players were doing fine but I made a tactical error by sacrificing both bishops without looking ahead properly. It was mostly by luck that white made a worse tactical error in move 22. I spent about 15 minutes analysing the position - which for me is a very long time to spend on a move - and my suspicions were correct: there was a promising mating attack on. White made one last error in move 23 where he could have blocked the mate but by playing without looking to the end of the sequence he let me force a mate.
I hope you enjoyed reading this. Please feel free to comment."

I am tempted to swap off at once but the database recommends e5 as the best move - it does enable me to get my own dsb out.

I can prevent this however with d6 so that if white plays Qg7 Henry can move to d7 opening up a line for his wife Glenda to defend the rook on h8.

White has the option of either leaving his queen where it is taking my queen - either option results in a queen trade disarming white's mating attack or retreating it.  White takes the latter option by checking on h3.  Henry goes back to his home square.

I choose the queenside as there is more pawn cover.  I might think about either a kingside or queenside mating attack on the white king wherever he chooses to go.  Both kingside and queenside is looking mega draughty.

I do not get to carry out my castle by hand plan because my opponent throws in the sponge on the grounds of Impending Ruinous Loss of Material!  He resigned because he felt he had no play for the pawn minus and indeed his shattered queenside pawn structure could be a very vulnerable target resulting in further loss of material.  As in a previous note where is the safest place for the white king?  All in all I think that black certainly has a clear advantage.  This game was unrated so I did not win any points.

I will play my knight to f3 while black plays his bishop to g7 and then castles which is perfectly in line with the Pirc or Robatsch.  The Pirc Defense btw is d6 and the Robatsch Defense is g6 which is a very hypermodern way for black to defend against white's first move e5.

I felt so despondent that it took me another two days to make a move - thankfully I had a 15 day time control to play with!  I finally decided to play b4 - a move which would release Glenda from protecting it and should the Wicked Witch of the West land a check on b6 then I would not lose the b pawn.  This move also expands on the queenside.

But anticipating the freeing of the bishop on c1 to attack black's queen from g5 the black knight is reluctant to abandon its post just to capture the king pawn.  The knight would stand on an unprotected square and have to retreat in the face of Re1 or d3 thus giving up a tempo."

Nh3 - this move gives the white lsb control over the d5 square and the white knight is eyeing up f4 or g5 which will hit out at e6 and it will need black to open up the kingside with g5 (if Nf4) or h6 (if Ng5) rather risky if I want to castle short.

540,20,6,Nf7,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nqnpp/2p5/3p1p2/3P4/3NPNP1/PPQ2PBP/R4RK1 w - -',14. .......... Nf7 - I think due to Ion's earlier note this was the loser.  Although it contests control of e5 it ensures my lsb is blocked in and it hinders the completion of my development.  If I had played Nf3 - although that would have allowed one of Ion's knights to come to e5 that would have allowed e6 and then one of the knights could have then gone to f7 or e7 and perhaps forced an exchange of one or both of the knights.

If Glenda had gone straight to c7 then I would have had time to back off my bishop to c8 and swap off one pair of rooks on the b file.  In a pressure situation like this time is of the essence!  If I had perhaps got in an earlier g6 then Glenda could have gone straight to c7 and all may have been well.

Rc8 - after a plethora of exchanges black is not only a pawn minus but my rook is reduced to utter passivity defending the backward pawn on c6.  The only white pawns on Ion's second rank are the f pawn and the h pawn.  They are defended by the white king so no counter targets here.
547,20,13,3Ne1,b'2r5/4knpp/R1p5/2Pp1p2/3P4/4P1P1/5P1P/4N1K1 b - -',30. Ne1 - makes for e5 or b5 either way striking out at the c6 pawn.  Ion chooses to plonk it on e5 after I back my knight off to d8 to defend the stricken c pawn.  Note that with the knight on e5 Henry is prevented from defending c6 which would have released the black rook for action down the open b file.

41. f5 Ng5 
42. Rxg7  Kd8 
43. Rg6  - white could also force an exchange of rooks with Rxc7 which still wins but more slowly but I think this is the best move here (I will be a second pawn down and about to lose a third - the g and f pawns will become passed and the c pawn continues to be a target - this pawn will fall if I try to counter with my rook.  I do not think that my rook will be able to mop up Ion's pawns in time - therefore time to resign!)

So ends the lesson on how retarded development can be severely punished by the strong player.

Have a nice day everyone!

Gioachino Greco was one of the earliest chess experts.  This game took place around 1619 almost four centuries ago.  Greco considered this one of his best games.  It is very short and has no need for intense calculation but rather shows how being greedy and forcing the position can be a big mistake especially in a fianchetto position.  Greco starts with the familiar e4."
553,21,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"The Queen's Fianchetto opening.  This move shows Black is willing to give up most direct control of the center.  This is quite dangerous for inexperienced players as we will see later on white will attack Black's king quickly and one false move could end the game.  Black must try to meet the threat on his king while still attacking White.  

To players that are unfamiliar to the Queen's Fianchetto opening it may seem weird just how many of these moves are considered ""book"".  But more on that later.

Also please note the difference between the Queen's Fianchetto opening and a fianchetto position.  Fianchettos are great solid positions even for a castled king.  However starting the game by playing a fianchetto and not developing the center first is a bit more dangerous than developing the center pawns and a knight or two first."
554,21,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"White is happy to dominate the center.  This is probably the most tradition and natural move.  

This brings up an interesting point.  If your opponent ever plays a move you are unfamiliar with or that is a bit unorthodox you should just continue normally after accessing any possible threats.  Sometimes your opponent is just hoping to throw you off your game with an unfamiliar move.  

Do as Greco did and just play normally."
555,21,3,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is where the fianchetto actually comes in.  The bishop is attacking the longest light-squared diagonal on the board.  One note is it may be positionally better to fianchetto after getting at least some center developement.  Also once the pawn move is played moving the bishop to the fianchetto position is a must.  You need to finish the combination quickly.
556,21,4,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Greco always preferred his bishop on d3 rather than c4 or b5.  This was obviously a good choice as we will see later on.

In fact these types of openings were very popular in the hypermodern movement of the late 1900's.  One of the movement's ideas was that occupying the center was not a necessity.  It is very interesting that a game played 400 years ago used an opening very popular now.

Here Black offers a pawn to break up White's center.  Also avoiding direct contact Black still contests the center."

1b) Si copre di donna. Allora l'unica coerente � g6 scambio di donne (e non � forzato occhio) e rimane il mio pedone bianco in f7. Se Re7 per prenderlo io posso prendere in c7 direttamente o usare il cavallo in b5. In entrambi i casi non vedevo chiaro se mantenevo l'iniziativa (ci sono sempre i salti dei suoi cavalli da tenere in conto).
1c) Pu� anche rifugiare il re in c8 e qui non so proprio come andare avanti. Avrei solo un pedone in pi� magra consolazione!

2) h4 con l'idea Ah3. Questa viene contrarrestata come prima da De8. 

3) Cb5 con l'idea di minacciare c7 da dove poi si minaccia e6. Ma con Tc8 mi blocca. E poi dato che pu� sempre tagliarmi la ritirata (o l'appoggio a seconda se mangio c7 di alfiere o di cavallo) pu� anche permettersi di offrire lo scambio di donne e lasciare in presa c7 poi con la torre mi guadagna due pezzi. O dopo lo scambio di donne Ad6 e chi si � visto si � visto. 

4) Ab5. Blocco il cavallo ma a che pro? A parte che con a6 mi rimanda indietro. 
L'unico vantaggio pu� essere che se AxC poi il mio alfiere nero � libero di occupare e5 e attaccare g7 e poi avanzare il pedone in f fino al debole f5. 
Non pu� proteggere direttamente con la torre in g8 per Df7  ma pu� portare il cavallo in c4 minacciandomi due punti (e3 e b2) ma soprattutto minacciando di scambiarmi l'alfiere. Posso fare direttamente Axg7 non gli rimane che AxA DxA  e adesso dopo D37 praticamente non mi rimane molto solo lo scambio e poi perdere a mia volta uno dei due pedoni minacciati dal cavallo.

669,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',It starts off with the kings pawn Opening
670,29,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now My opponent comes out with his knight first which is fatal for my plan
671,29,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',and i follow
672,29,3,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',then he brings out his kings pawn
673,29,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',and my knight
674,29,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',then his knight so it basically starts off with a 4 knights opening
675,29,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now Here is where the Halloween's Gambit starts out by me sacrificing my knight to gain the middle
676,29,7,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Naturally he is gonna take it
677,29,8,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',Then I push his knights back
678,29,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And here there are other places he could have gone and this opening still works but this is the easiest 
679,29,10,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3P4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',so I kep chaseing the Knight away 
680,29,11,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Then he comes back to where my pawn was...
681,29,12,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq f3',and I push again 
682,29,13,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/3P4/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So then he moves to the other side I could keep chasing but it would not do me any good 
683,29,14,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/3PP3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So here i chase the other knight and push him back to his original spot
684,29,15,Ng8,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3PP3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',OK at this point i have complete control of the middle of the board
685,29,16,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/3P2n1/4P3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',and so now i want to box him in so he will take with the pawn on C7
686,29,17,cxd6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/3p2n1/4P3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',and then i will counter with my pawn
687,29,18,1exd6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/3P2n1/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',now he is boxed in now there are other moves that could be made but there are also other counters for the opening as well but this is what you usually end up with after the Halloween's gambit but since it worked out so well let me show you the rest of the game. Now look and my opponent has basically no position at all.
688,29,19,1Qb6,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P2n1/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Here of course he brings his queen out to try and get rid of the pawn so i will counter once again
689,29,20,1Nb5,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P2n1/1N6/5P2/8/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',so now i will protect my pawn
690,29,21,1Kd8,b'r1bk1bnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P2n1/1N6/5P2/8/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',now he had to move his king cause he is basically boxed in and that messes up any chance of castling
691,29,22,1f5,b'r1bk1bnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P2n1/1N3P2/8/8/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',this time i attack the other knight
692,29,23,1Ne5,b'r1bk1bnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P4/1N2nP2/8/8/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',and he basically has no where to go he is just setting my pieces up for me
693,29,24,1Bf4,b'r1bk1bnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P4/1N2nP2/5B2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',and now i bring out the bishop which will also protect my pawn
694,29,25,1a6,b'r1bk1bnr/1p1p1ppp/pq1P4/1N2nP2/5B2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',so he attacks my night and i can safely move that
695,29,26,1Nc7,b'r1bk1bnr/1pNp1ppp/pq1P4/4nP2/5B2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',and at this point he has to move his rook so he still cannot get that pawn
696,29,27,1Rb8,b'1rbk1bnr/1pNp1ppp/pq1P4/4nP2/5B2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',so now i get the knight back that i gave him and I'm way ahead at this point
697,29,28,1Bc3,b'1rbk1bnr/1pNp2pp/pq1P1p2/5P2/8/2B5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',at this point i should have just moved the bishop back but instead let him get the pawn at this point I'm going to move along a couple moves cause i made some mistakes along the way i new the game was won
698,29,29,Re8,b'1rbkr3/1p1pn1pp/pN3p2/6q1/1B6/5R2/PPP1Q1Pb/3RK3 w - -',ok at this point I knew there was a mate here about 10 to 12 moves away i didn't see it right away but after thinking i got it here we go but i would have to give some pieces up but int he end I would get it
699,29,30,Kxd7,b'1r2r3/1p1kn1pp/p4p2/6q1/1B6/5R2/PPP1Q1Pb/4K3 w - -',OK here i dropped 2 pieces to him on purpose no less and here is where i get him 
700,29,31,2Rd3+,b'1r2r3/1p1kn1pp/p4p2/6q1/1B6/3R4/PPP1Q1Pb/4K3 b - -',check

702,29,33,2Qe6+,b'1r2r3/1p2n1pp/p1k1Qp2/6q1/1B6/3R4/PPP3Pb/4K3 b - -',so i bring my queen down and check again
703,29,34,2Kb5,b'1r2r3/1p2n1pp/p3Qp2/1k4q1/1B6/3R4/PPP3Pb/4K3 w - -',he has to move king
704,29,35,2a4+,b'1r2r3/1p2n1pp/p3Qp2/1k4q1/PB6/3R4/1PP3Pb/4K3 b - a3',no here i give him another piece knowing that he is dead in the water
705,29,36,2Kxb4,b'1r2r3/1p2n1pp/p3Qp2/6q1/Pk6/3R4/1PP3Pb/4K3 w - -',then here took me a little thinking i new it was there but did not see it right away

Now White has several ways of winning now taking on h7 with queen or bishop threatens mate or Bh6 is also strong. Then I glanced across the board at my angel. I couldn't do it to her. I played 9.f3 which also seems a good move trapping the Bishop on h1 in.

Do you want a draw and then we can see if we get a result with colours reversed?"" She nodded her lovely little head and held out her soft warm hand. I once again had the pleasure of shaking it.

Bc3 - black makes a further error on move 17 by playing his pawn up to a5 - this allowed me to win this pawn by a bishop fork on b6.  Black could have the beginnings of a mating attack on my kingside position so I cannot afford to be complacent here.

If the queen retreats then an exchange-winning knight fork will come on f6 as the g7 pawn is pinned.  This will allow black to win his pawn back and my kingside pawn structure will be slightly compromised but as I am still a piece up this exchange is desirable.

As my opponent was still on-line I knew that I would come back to my desk and receive a gameknot message telling me that I have delivered mate or at the very least received a white flag!  When I returned to my desk Gameknot sent me this message ""Game Won (Checkmate) Congratulations!

I think of throwing in the sponge here but consider what type of ending I am in.  Firstly if you are one or two pawns down then the endgame you want to be in is either a Q P ending or an opposite coloured bishops ending.  At the moment I have both.  If you have an active queen in these types of ending then you have the chance of landing some useful checks.  Glenda does just that by landing on b1 at the first opportunity.

The a pawn cannot be taken because the Wicked Witch of the West will land on d8 giving a nasty check on me pore ole 'enry stuck in the corner.  In fact come to think of it she could land on that square now but my Good Witch of the North Glenda can start checking again.

I decide against taking the h pawn because it is a non checking move and I do not want to allow the Wicked Witch of the West to hassle Henry so I keep Glenda on checking my opponent's king instead.
749,32,17,Qf2,b'7k/p4B1p/6p1/2b1P3/P4P1P/8/2KQ1q2/8 w - -',44. ........... Qf2.  Glenda pins the Wicked Witch of the West to the White King.  The exchange of queens would leave me a pawn down but in an ending with bishops of opposite colour.  I think I will be able to hold of the passer on e5 and protect my remote a pawn with the dsb.  I therefore decide to offer a draw.  My opponent decided to accept and I had to hand back 4.7 rating points I obtained from him in Stealth & Wealth.

Nf3. 2. c3 all look like more active options.  The Knight cannot take the pawn even if it were white's move again because the queen defends it and probably will defend it for a while.  This move deserves a ?! (slight mistake) in my opinion but probably should lead to = (equality) as white has/had the move edge.
896,38,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"Some might think: ""Hey you called white's move passive.  Now you're DEFENDING a pawn you said yourself would be safe by the queen for a while??  That seems just as passive if not more so than white's move!"" But in fact there's much more to this move than that.  I do not block the important c-pawn with my knight.  Rather I block the f-pawn which probably shouldn't move immediately anyway (that weak diagonal can kill many a good king if opened).  I defend a pawn that's already defended yes but there's more to it than that.
1) I am one step closer to an early kingside castle.  If I play a moves like 3. e6 or 3. g6 followed by 4. Be7 (Bb4) or 4. Bg7 I could then castle at move 5.
2) In a strange way I do need to defend my d5 pawn if I am to play a specific Queen's pawn opening.  Consider 2....c5.  If I try this reversed Queen's Gambit of sorts I see I lose two pawns and probably the game after 2...c5 3. dxc5 e5 4. Qxd5.  It is clear that my d-pawn is not in fact defended sufficiently in this course of play.
3) In an even stranger continuation that I sometimes like to play as white I am preparing e5 with this move.  The idea there would be to play at some point in some order c6 Nd7 e6 Bd6 and finally e5.  This is very slow play and often times I opt for more active lines but it is a powerful idea.  If/when I force white to recapture on e5 my knight jumps powerfully into play and reveals as black my light-square bishop.  This is a perfectly fine idea.

In any event the merits of this move as compared to those of white's can be summed up as my knight being involved in a variety of possible plans allowing a prompt castle and not blocking my c-pawn.  It is important to have such a general idea in even (especially!) opening positions as these are forseeable and can prevent early disasters."

I believe an immediate Nc6 or e6 were better tries as they would have been more active.

903,38,10,cxd3,b'rn1qkb1r/1pp1pppp/p4n2/3p4/3P1B2/2NPP3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Objectively about as strong as Qxd3 though most people would prefer to gain a tempo in that way.  This move can be very potent if white takes the half-open c-file with a rock or two and possibly his queen and if white builds up a strong center.
904,38,11,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2NPP3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',? (Blunder).  This move is outright bad.  Nc6 and g6 would have been much better as this move makes 4....a6 an undeniable waste of tempo.  It is not catastrophic but it is a slight error in judgment.  Now e5 if played at all will take two tempii instead of the more natural one.
905,38,12,Be5,b'rn1qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/3pB3/3P4/2NPP3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',? I cannot help but think that this was meant to prevent g6 which I would not do after e6 anyway but even at this strange task it would fail as my queen defends the knight in the meanwhile of the two moves it would take to get my bishop fianchettoed at g7.  Wastes a tempo (or gives my a6 tempo back) by moving a developed piece more than once.
906,38,13,Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/1ppn1ppp/p3pn2/3pB3/3P4/2NPP3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Attacks the newly vulnerable bishop.  Though both worth roughly three the bishop is thought to be slightly more valuable than the knight and I am usually happy to trade knight for bishop.  
907,38,14,a3,b'r2qkb1r/1ppn1ppp/p3pn2/3pB3/3P4/P1NPP3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',"Same idea as my 4...a6.  It stops my bishop from actively pinning his knight.  Better would have been to develop queen or knight and castle or at least move rook to the half-open c-file.  This allows me to win a small gain of bishop for knight an edge I use all the way until the end of the game.  The main reasons a bishop is preferred to a knight are basically two-fold (though this is a highly simplified explanation):
1) Bishops can defend or attack the same square if they are attacked by retreating along that diagonal while knights cannot as they alternate from light to dark squares.
2) Bishops can move long distances more quickly an advantage not to be underestimated in the end game especially.
Knights do have some merits namely:
1) Knights can jump over pieces giving them tremendous flexibility especially in a closed opening or middle-game.  
2) they can attack both colored squares whereas bishops are forever stuck on one (light or dark).
Still bishops are objectively viewed as slightly better than knights in most situations"

I was hoping to lock the pawn structure by seeing an advance of 9. d4 which would trap his pawns on dark squares where my bishop could harass them but the reply was better than that.  Still my knight was attacked and this move was fine

921,38,28,1Na4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1n2pp/p3pb2/2pp4/N2P4/PP2PN2/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now the pawn is all that stops me from taking the rook.  However my opponent has threatened my pawn on c5 so I should respond.....

This is prefered to Be7 as moving the queen connects my rooks and makes it slightly more active.  e7 is preferred for the queen here (as compared to c7) because at c7 the rook could potentially attack my queen (more x-rays).

To truly defend the pawn only Qa4 would have worked and that is an awkward place for his queen (as compared to my powerfully placed queen).  If 21. Qa4 the game is roughly even.  With this move I win the pawn and eventually the game.

d5 � minacciato. 
Se faccio Th4  e poi prendo h5 lui prende d5. Continuo ad avere due pedoni liberi ma la mia torre � scomoda. E anche lui ha un pedone libero e quando questo avanza ho le mie belle difficolt� a fermarlo (anche il cavallo � inchiodato). 

Se avanzo a d4 Ce8 . Attenzione a dove va il re per evitare un altro scacco con gli occhiali e perdo la torre. Potrebbe essere perpetuo a meno che vada per esempio in f8. Allora Cf6 minacciando la torre e difendendo h5! Adesso lo scacco non mi serve pi�. Se la torre va in f5 Cd7  e perdo il pedone in e!

Non sono solo quelle le minacce. Una volta rotti i pedoni centrali le nere devono difendere quello in d che comunque non pu� avanzare. Rimane solo il pedone h SE il nero riesce a prenderlo senza perdere anche d!

Che il ""gentile lettore"" mi dica: possono vincere le nere?

Ora altra cosa � che le bianche abbiano giocato male..."
