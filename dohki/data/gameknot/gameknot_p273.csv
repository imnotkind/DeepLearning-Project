48,3,1,Bg4,b'r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p1p3/6b1/1P3N2/PBPPQPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',good move but he doesn't anticipate me swapping queens

82,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I opened this game with a fairly standard King's Gambit which my opponent accepted.  I was unable to win back the pawn at any point in the game which is unusual in my games but I took as a mark of superior play on my opponent's part.  The game itself was somewhat unusual but I do not intend to analyze the greater portion of it.  On move 33 I missed a possibility and was forced either to exchange Rooks - which I had been avoiding - or lose a tempo which could have been crucial.
83,7,1,3Rd1,b'8/pkp5/2pr3p/6pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/3R4 b - -',I was here considering advancing the Queen's pawn establishing myself on Black's half of the board which seemed critical as I was playing a pawn down.  In this position it is crucial to remove mobility in Black's Queen-side as his King-side pawns will win the game if the White King wanders too far.
84,7,2,3Rd5,b'8/pkp5/2p4p/3r2pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/3R4 w - -',Black blocks the advance of the pawn.
85,7,3,3Rb1+,b'8/pkp5/2p4p/3r2pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/1R6 b - -',I am looking to drive Black's king to the side of the board and then advance the d-pawn.  It was not a particularly well-thought-out idea as the Rook block is in plain view.
86,7,4,3Rb5,b'8/pkp5/2p4p/1r4pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/1R6 w - -',Black as I thought looks to force the exchange.  With the Rooks off the board the extra King-side pawn brings the game to a quick finish.  Although there are weaknesses to this move I missed them.
87,7,5,3Rxb5+,b'8/pkp5/2p4p/1R4pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/8 b - -',Better on reflection is Rb4 pinning the Rook.  White's king is free to move and Black has to spend moves extricating his Queen's side.
88,7,6,3cxb5+,b'8/pkp5/7p/1p4pP/2KP1p2/P1P2P2/8/8 w - -',What should be the clinching move.  The King cannot capture as on 34. Kxb5 g4 gains Black a Queen!
89,7,7,3Kd3,b'8/pkp5/7p/1p4pP/3P1p2/P1PK1P2/8/8 b - -',Better is Kd5 briefly containing the Black King.  But in the meantime White's isolated a-pawn is weak and in combination with Black's King-side majority will probably lose the game.  White cannot keep at least one from Queening and is forced to play for his own Queen.  Play might proceed: 35. ... Kb6 36. e4 Ka5 37. f5 Ka4 38. Kg6 g4! 39. Kxh6 gxf3 40. Kg7 f2 41. h6 f1=Q 42. h7 Qg2 .  Even if White can Queen the h-pawn he will be forced to interpose and exchange and Black can Queen his a-pawn with relative ease.  If instead 39. fxg4 f3 White is another move behind in Queening his pawn and there is no doubt whatsoever.
90,7,8,3a5,b'8/1kp5/7p/pp4pP/3P1p2/P1PK1P2/8/8 w - a6',Threatens 36. b4 at which point either the a-pawn or the g- or f- pawns will Queen.

92,7,10,3Kb6,b'8/2p5/1k5p/pp4pP/2PP1p2/P2K1P2/8/8 w - -',Coming to the rescue.  Probably an attempt to protect the c-pawn although 36. ... c6 would do that more effectively.  Still insufficient to make a difference if played properly.
93,7,11,3c5+,b'8/2p5/1k5p/ppP3pP/3P1p2/P2K1P2/8/8 b - -',Although this should result in the disastrous 37. ... Kc6 at which point the Black King prevents a further push White is running out of time - and I'm not thinking clearly.  On the other hand 37. d5 invites 37. ...Kc5 which is even worse as White has no decent moves left.  (38. Kc3? and the Black King and new b-pawn walk down the board.  38. Ke4? and Black's position to push on the a-file is even stronger than it was.  38. d6??? loses another pawn.)
94,7,12,3Kc6,b'8/2p5/2k4p/ppP3pP/3P1p2/P2K1P2/8/8 w - -',Black makes his move and then analyzing the position decides that White has won.  As explained in the notes I see no chance for White (my own) position.  What am I missing?
95,8,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',1. d4 is not my regular opening for white; most of the time I'm playing the London System. 
96,8,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Wow ! A whole new world opened for me ! Dutch ! It was the first time I've played against that opening-line.. Let's see what it brings..
97,8,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Let's go into Dutch Defense then..
98,8,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',With this knight-move white controls all centre-fields.. 
99,8,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"In meanwhile the opening is called ""Dutch with c4 & Nc3"". Black makes an open line to position his bishop on b4 to pin my knight."
100,8,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black's preparing to castle..
101,8,6,e3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Normal developing.. One more move and white is also ready to castle on kingside.
102,8,7,Ne4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/5pB1/2PPn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',A nice attacking move from black ! 6. ... h6 would create openings in her king's defence where white could take advantage of..
103,8,8,Bxe7,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppB1pp/4p3/5p2/2PPn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Black is forced to take my bishop.. On the next move I will capture her knight wich after taking back will create a double-pawn.
104,8,9,Nd2,b'rnb2rk1/ppppq1pp/4p3/8/2PPp3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Attacking that lonely e-pawn.. 9. Ne5 would result in 9. ... d6 so it would cost me another move to get my knight to a safer place..
105,8,10,d5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4p3/3p4/2PPp3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ d6',Protecting the e-pawn.. Actually I think black hopes on 10. cxd5 exd5; wich will re-arrange black's centre-pawns.. 
106,8,11,e5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1q1pp/8/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',11. dxe5 would mess up my pawn-structure while awaiting 11. ? exd4 12. exd4 e3 would bring me in troubles.. Let's develop my bishop to e2 (only field available since 11. Bb5 would straighten black's pawn-diagonal) to prepare the castling..
107,8,12,a6,b'rnb2rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I don't really understand why black played this move; since there is no threat from white's bishop..
108,8,13,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Finally castling :)
109,8,14,1Be6,b'rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p3b3/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Maybe 12. ... Bd6 would've been better ? So black could have the chance to play 13. ... Bb5 ?
110,8,15,1f3,b'rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p3b3/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4PP2/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I thought opening the f-line would be great; since my two rooks and queen where on the same rank (a nice open line could become desastreus for black; once white took control of it !).
111,8,16,1fxe4,b'rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Pppb2/3PP3/4P3/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Opening a nice line for my rook. Black now can take my pawn with his pawn wich will double his structure up once again. Not so good so it's best to wait for white's actions..
112,8,17,1exd5,b'rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p3b3/2PPp3/3P4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',That pawn is a double-pawn anyway so why not putting some pressure on black while winning some pawns ? The treathening on the f-file still remains so .. 
113,8,18,1Bxd5,b'rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Pbp3/3P4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Only (good) move at the moment.
114,8,19,1Rxf8+,b'rn3Rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Pbp3/3P4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Exchanging some pieces.. Situation at the moment: black has an isolated pawn at the e-line wich will be lost later on; while white still has a closed pawn-line from the a- till e-rank.. 
115,8,20,Nd7,b'r4qk1/1ppn2pp/p7/2Pbp3/3P4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/R4QK1 w - -',Nice move !! Now black keeps being dangerous because it won't have to play 18. Qxf8  Kxf8  19. Rf1 . (where black would need to spend another move to develop his closed-in rook).
116,8,21,1Rf1,b'5rk1/1ppn2pp/p7/2Pbp3/3P4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/5RK1 b - -',Is black willing to exchange her last rook ? 
117,8,22,1exd4,b'5rk1/1ppn2pp/p7/2Pb4/3p4/4P3/PP1NB1PP/5RK1 w - -',Nope she won't.. Trading the isolated pawn isn't a bad idea in my opinion ?
118,8,23,Bxa2,b'5rk1/1ppn2pp/p7/2P5/3P4/8/bP1NB1PP/5RK1 w - -',"A ""free"" pawn ? No it now costs black her bishop with a check.. She's forced to take my bishop pretty obvious."
119,8,24,2Nxc4,b'5rk1/1ppn2pp/p7/2P5/2NP4/8/1P4PP/5RK1 b - -',A nice position for my knight !!
120,8,25,2b6,b'5rk1/2pn2pp/pp6/2P5/2NP4/8/1P4PP/5RK1 w - -',The score is equal at the moment so black has good chances of promoting on the queenside ! 
121,8,26,2c6,b'5rk1/2pn2pp/ppP5/8/2NP4/8/1P4PP/5RK1 b - -',23. cxb6 would favour black.. So I'm NOT going to do this ! Giving some pressure on c6 feels better.. 
122,8,27,2Nf6,b'5rk1/2p3pp/ppP2n2/8/2NP4/8/1P4PP/5RK1 w - -',Aiming for e4 for helping her pawns ?
123,8,28,2Rf3,b'5rk1/2p3pp/ppP2n2/8/2NP4/5R2/1P4PP/6K1 b - -',Can't remember why I played this move.. But I remember it had a good reason !
124,8,29,Ne4,b'3r2k1/2p3pp/ppP5/8/2NPn3/3R4/1P4PP/6K1 w - -',There's e4.. Good place for the knight !
125,8,30,2Nd2,b'3r2k1/2p3pp/ppP5/8/3Pn3/3R4/1P1N2PP/6K1 b - -',Exchanging knights ? In fact this move wasn't so good; since 26. ... Nc5 would cost me at least a pawn at max a rook :/
126,8,31,2Nc5,b'3r2k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2n5/3P4/3R4/1P1N2PP/6K1 w - -',There you go..
127,8,32,2Nb3,b'6k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2n5/3r4/1N2R3/1P4PP/6K1 b - -',Double-attack going for the knight-exchange ?
128,8,33,2Rd1+,b'6k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2n5/8/1N2R3/1P4PP/3r2K1 w - -',Nice move but I think it only helps white to bring his King into the game..
129,8,34,Rd3,b'6k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2n5/8/1N1rR3/1P3KPP/8 w - -',Nice try ! 30. Rxd3 Nxd3  costs me a pawn.. So it's best to take away that rook's security !
130,8,35,Rd2+,b'6k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2N5/8/4R3/1P1r1KPP/8 w - -',Still going for that lonely pawn ! 
131,8,36,3Re2,b'6k1/2p3pp/ppP5/2N5/8/8/1P1rRKPP/8 b - -',White wants to exchange those rooks hardly ! After exchanging and loosing the knight there's a good chance for white to promote (since black will have two pawns on the c-line).
132,8,37,3Kd3,b'6k1/2p3pp/p1P5/2p5/8/3K4/1P4PP/8 b - -',Going for those pawns !! The following moves are one by one good moves for both sides..
133,8,38,3Kxc5,b'8/2p3pp/p1P1k3/2K5/8/8/1P4PP/8 b - -',Now it's getting risky.. If one side blunders things will be over.. (within x-number of moves offcourse).
134,8,39,3Kf5,b'8/2p3pp/p1P5/2K2k2/8/8/1P4PP/8 w - -',Excellent move ! White's king is forced to go back to the fourth rank because all ways till the sixt rank are closed.
135,8,40,3Kb4,b'8/2p3pp/p1P5/5k2/1K6/8/1P4PP/8 b - -',Heading for that a-pawn..
136,8,41,3Ke5,b'8/2p3pp/p1P5/4k3/1K6/8/1P4PP/8 w - -',Coming back for the c-pawn. A good choice; since there isn't any treath on the g- and h-file..
137,8,42,3b4,b'8/2p3pp/K1k5/8/1P6/8/6PP/8 b - b3',Closing black's c5 hide-out-square while next move 40. b5 would result in a pawn-exhange and a sprint of both kings to the other side; where black should he favoured ! 
138,8,43,3g6,b'8/2p4p/K1k3p1/8/1P6/8/6PP/8 w - -',Since white's king is closed-in the chance on a pass-trough is great !
139,8,44,4g3,b'8/2p5/K1k3p1/7p/1P5P/6P1/8/8 b - -',Backing up for 41. ... g5  42. hxg5 h4 (wich offcourse would be a bad idea; since white would promote for sure).
140,8,45,4Kb5,b'8/2p5/4k1p1/1K5p/1P5P/6P1/8/8 b - -',I need that pawn !! :) Black will probably play 43. ... Kd5 so my king will be forced to move back up to the a-line.. All depends on the pawn-pushing of both sides !
141,8,46,4Kd5,b'8/2p5/6p1/1K1k3p/1P5P/6P1/8/8 w - -',There he is :) Note black is still on the good side for the sprint to the g- and h-pawns !

challenge the solidness of White's huge pawn on e4.  Also white's d pawn would be hemmed 
in stagnating the development of White's queenside minor pieces.  
Problem with this option is that uses an additional move for the same piece in the opening.  Already
having the disadvantage as the player who goes second in the game Black should not nurse that
problem by trying to stir up trouble just yet in the center.  Indeed it was good that Black didn't waste 
time with that- Black didn't even have time to castle this game!"

Another option here for White is to develop his bishop to Bb5 and allowing the king to castle.  If
Black moves his queen to b6 White can capture the knight on c6 and reducing some pressure off
of d4.  Tough call as this would give Black the two bishop advantage.  "

in correspondance it gave me a chance to play Nh6.  Tough variation since the French is already so 
dense but interesting and fun nonetheless.  

White can also play Be3 because of the well-known tactic in case Black
gets pawn greedy: 
6...cxd4 7. cxd4 Nxd4 8.Nxd4 Qxd4 9.Bb5! and the discovered attack on
Black's queen is fatal."

on the kingside on the h file (after...Bg7 fianchetto Black has a nice castle).  In exchange white has the more mobility or ""space"" since the position is closed in the center thus making his knights more valuable.  
Indeed Black would have trouble developing the ""problem"" bishop in the French Defense.  It wasn't until
move 15 where Black's light squared bishop made a cameo during an exchange on e6.

On another note if White decides not to exchange on h6 then if Black moves the Knight to the
 outpost f5 White can always play the irritating g4.  "

One reason Black sends his Queen on an early voyage in the French is to
exert influence on the B file.  The b2 pawn can easily become a source of
pain in this opening.  "

Notice here an idea that I read in one of Silmans books.  Certainly not an original idea but he helped 
me understand it better:  It is common that your attack should be directed towards the side where your pawns are pointed.  
With my f7-e6-d5-c4 it's easy to see that my attack on the queenside is further justified.  "

point I knew that I could simply exchange off all the major pieces leaving me with a pawn structure

usefulness of her Queen but also because it grants Black more time to march down the center.

behind now and will have to catch up very quickly if she wants to stop the pawn march.

the four center squares or as close as possible)
the king in the endgame has more space and as a result more control of the whole board.  as in the opening where we try to castle asap in the endgame its a good idea to centralize the king asap.  Here white could have a plan of f3 Kf2 Ke3 etc.  
Of course there are some exceptions:  you might take a look at this position here and say ""the centralized
black king is in jeopardy.  Though even with the two white rooks owning the e file and close to the enemy
king there are no significant mating threats.  Indeed as GM Mike Christiansen has said ""the threat 
is often greater than the execution"".  Nevertheless Black is using his king as an active piece: claiming

268,15,3,dxc3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The dxc3 option rather than bxc3 opens the file for white's Queen.
269,15,4,Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4n3/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Currently it seems black has stronger position however and gains a pawn.
270,15,5,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4n3/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The late defense of the Ruy Lopez opening may have opened black up a bit more than he wished.
271,15,6,d6,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/B3n3/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Also a late move perhaps would have been stronger played earlier say 6.. d6. However black retains material advantage but at what cost?
272,15,7,Qd5,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np4/3Qp3/B3n3/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',The Queen steps forth. Many may assume this is far too early to bring the Queen into play however since it forces black to defend the e4 Knight and gives white the opportunity to open up black's Queenside it is indeed a strong move.
273,15,8,1Qxc6+,b'r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p1Qp1n2/4p3/8/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',And white regains the gambit pawn with distinct positional advantage.
274,15,9,1Bd7,b'r2qk2r/2pb1ppp/p1Qp1n2/4p3/8/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',A solid defence (though forced) attacks white's Queen while protecting the queenside Rook.
275,15,10,1Qc4,b'r2qk2r/2pb1ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2Q5/2P1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',And time is ripe to pressure f7...
276,15,11,1Nh4,b'r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2Q4N/2P1B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The obvious Kingside castle gives white an extra developmental move as middle-game gets into it's stride.
277,15,12,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p4n2/3pp3/2Q4N/2P1B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',White's Queen is always going to be under pressure and there is a danger it's early development role will negate the extra moves he has gained.
278,15,13,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/p3bn2/3pp3/7N/1QP1B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black is coming to the fore with clear strength of strategy. He understands the vulnerability of white's Queen and while he himself develops white is forced again to adjust his Queen's position...
279,15,14,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/1Qp2ppp/p3bn2/3pp3/7N/2P1B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',It may be that black is almost too focussed on attacking white's Queen to notice that White has a strategy of his own...
280,15,15,1Bc5,b'3q1rk1/2p2ppp/Q3bn2/2Bpp3/7N/2P5/PrP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White places black firmly back on the back foot.
281,15,16,1Bd4,b'3qr1k1/2p2ppp/4bn2/3p4/3Bp2N/2P5/PrP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',This is where white's early development and attack of black's queenside becomes obvious. Though he has doubled pawns this may work to white's advantage.
282,15,17,2Bxc5,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/4bn2/2Bp4/4p2N/2P5/PrP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',And the result is white gains a pawn.
283,15,18,2Bg4,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/5n2/2Bp4/4p1bN/2P5/PrP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black renews focus on white's Queen as both players at this stage consider endgame strategy in what turns out to be a cat-and-mouse dogfight!
284,15,19,Rxc2,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/5n2/2Bp4/4p1bN/2P1Q3/P1r2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black regains the lost pawn however perhaps white considered this pawn already lost?
285,15,20,2Bb6,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/1B3n2/3p4/4p1bN/2P1Q3/P1r2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And it is time for white to start attacking black's Queen!
286,15,21,2Qc8,b'2q1r1k1/5ppp/1B3n2/3p4/4p1bN/2P1Q3/P1r2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black then shows the maturity of his strategic play forcing white to defend his c pawn.
287,15,22,Qd8,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/5n2/3p4/3Bp1bN/2P1Q3/P1r2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"White's choice to play back and forth allows him to make his next move from an alternative position with black having effectively ""lost"" a move."
288,15,23,2a4,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/5n2/3p4/P2Bp1bN/2P1Q3/2r2PPP/R4RK1 b - a3',"Advancing the pawn is the ""free"" move."
289,15,24,2g3,b'3qr1k1/5ppp/8/3p3n/P2Bp1bN/2P1Q1P1/2r2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',This is a further move from white that may raise some eyebrows. It is indeed extremely risky to expose the castled area in this manner however this will ultimately prove decisive as endgame approaches.
290,15,25,2Qg5,b'2q1r1k1/5ppp/8/3p2Qn/P2Bp1bN/2P3P1/4rP1P/R4RK1 b - -',Again white's back-and-forth attitude adds a little bit of depth to his position.
291,15,26,2g6,b'2q1r1k1/5p1p/6p1/3p2Qn/P2Bp1bN/2P3P1/4rP1P/R4RK1 w - -',Forced to defend his Knight black has inadvertently opened up the black diagonal. Something which white will be keen to capitalize on.
292,15,27,2Qxd5,b'2q1r1k1/5p1p/6p1/3Q3n/P2Bp1bN/2P3P1/4rP1P/R4RK1 b - -',Pins the f7 pawn.
293,15,28,2Bh3,b'2q1r1k1/5p1p/6p1/3Q3n/P2Bp2N/2P3Pb/4rP1P/R4RK1 w - -',This is clearly the beginning of endgame and both players are focussing all their efforts on trying to gain a little advantage when both are so evenly and tightly matched.
294,15,29,3Rxe2,b'4r1k1/5p1p/6p1/3Q3n/P2Bp1qN/2P3Pb/4RP1P/R5K1 b - -',Exchanges the rooks. This is extremely risky but it appears white has it covered since he can prevent any resulting mate because of his Knight's position on h4 and ability to block g2.
295,15,30,h6,b'4r1k1/5p2/6pp/3Q3n/P2Bp3/2P3Pb/4qPNP/R5K1 w - -',Black is turning the screw however the game is so tight it remains to be seen can he mate on time.
296,15,31,3Re1,b'4r1k1/5p2/6pp/3Q3n/P2Bp3/2P3Pb/4qPNP/4R1K1 b - -',An intelligent white move forces black's Queen back to g4 (via f3 - the hope of an early mate) allowing his Knight to return to h4 and set a trap.
297,15,32,3Be3,b'4r1k1/5p2/6pp/3Q3n/P3p1qN/2P1B1Pb/5P1P/4R1K1 b - -',There is a need to prevent black from advancing his e pawn further however white's strategy to mount a counter-attack on black is subtly developing.
298,15,33,3Qc6,b'4r1k1/5p2/2Q4p/6pn/P3p1qN/2P1B1Pb/5P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Clever move to drag the Rook out of position however leaving the defensive h4 Knight open for the taking could be a problem? Or the key to spring the trap?
299,15,34,gxh4,b'2r3k1/5p2/7Q/7n/P3p1qp/2P1B1Pb/5P1P/4R1K1 w - -',The trap is sprung. While black focussed so closely on his own strategy and seemingly invincible endgame white will counter in a make-or-break attempt to either mate or blow up the entire structure of the game.
300,15,35,Qf3,b'2r3k1/5p2/7Q/7n/P2Bp2p/2P2qPb/5P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Sucked into the trap of the Knight sacrifice black moves in for the kill unwittingly having missed the inevitable mate against himself.
301,15,36,3Qh8#,b'2r3kQ/5p2/8/7n/P2Bp2p/2P2qPb/5P1P/4R1K1 b - -',An incredibly tight game not without errors but stylish and fun to watch.
302,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"On Black's 15th move he creates a strange ""force field"" around his king which serves as a more powerful protecting wall than any standard castle could provide.  It is almost an invisible electric fence around his exposed stuck-in-the-center king.  I annotated this game to get some thoughts from other players regarding this bizarre chess phenomenon."

305,16,3,Qd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp4/5qp1/3Q4/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Which is 7. Qd5.
306,16,4,Bg7,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp2b1/5qp1/3Q4/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black chooses to double the attack on the knight.

The knight covers the d and f pawns well as g6 and the bishop covers f6 and e5.  The king protects the knight and is safely shielded by it.  Strange when it is better not to castle in a situation like this.  I nearly captured with the knight (it looked like a more active move) but this would have been a disaster.  After taking with the pawn I began to see the bizarre phenomenon of the force field."
323,16,21,1Bxa6,b'r3k3/ppp1n1b1/B7/3p1p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPq/RNB1K3 b Qq -',Gives the king some air and ruins Black's pawn structure on the queenside.

Had the King moved to d2 Black would have been given the challenge of extricating his queen from behind enemy lines and white would have done battle against the force field.  It was prior to White's 18th move that I analyzed the possibilities for both sides and in trying to figure out how White could break through i realized the strength of this defensive barrier around Balck's cetralized king.

I annotated this game because I was fascinated by this force field around Black's king - something that i did not plan in the game - I just fell upon it in trying to make the best move.  Hope you find this game interesting .  Any comments are welcome."
331,17,0,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Indian defense. Very standard.

497,27,4,Nbd2,b'r3kbnr/ppp1qppp/2np4/8/3PPBb1/3B1N2/PPPN2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',My plan by this move was to replace the f3 knight and subsequently protect the d4 pawn but as usual I overlook rather simple conditions in the opening like my  Nf3 being pinned and therefore not really protecting pawn d4.

So I'm thinking this is the time to exploit the developed advantage and equalize(or even gain) in material.
500,27,7,1g5,b'2kr1bnr/ppp1qp2/3p3p/6pb/Q3PB2/2PB1N1P/PP4P1/R4RK1 w - g6',And now I was following up my idea of keeping the developed advantage not getting intimidated and pushed into retreating/defensive playing even sacrifacing a piece

This because literally all of black's pieces are imprisoned.  When analyzing this position I never dreamed black would move 18...Kg7 because then 19. Nf5  forking black's king and queen... Hence I was expecting Kg5 threatening my rook and therefore I prepared Bxe8 in my mind. NEVER MOVE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE OPPONENTS LAST MOVE!!! Again basic knowledge but still it slip now and then
502,27,9,1Kg7,b'4rbnr/1Qp1qpk1/3p3p/1B5b/3NPR2/2P4P/PP4P1/R5K1 w - -', ?? BLACK BLUNDER! Black has just invited white for a clean kill and what does white respond?

504,27,11,1Qxe8,b'4qbnr/1Qp2pk1/3p3p/7b/3NPR2/2P4P/PP4P1/R5K1 w - -',I was of course disappointed of completely forgetting 19.Nf5  but still I considered having a superior position because of black's inactive pieces and I have now also have a material advantage. What is the best continuation for white? The big task for black is to quickly activate the pieces
505,27,12,Bg6,b'4qbnr/2Q2pk1/3p2bp/8/3NPR2/2P4P/PP4P1/R5K1 w - -',I'm sure black has a better move...Maybe Be7 then Nf6... and the rook is partly free.

512,27,19,3Qf2,b'3r4/4q2k/5nb1/1P3p1p/P4R2/2P4P/5QPK/5R2 b - -',Here I was also considering Qb4 but didn't find that one a good move (32.Qb4 Qxb4 and then black move Nd5)
513,27,20,3Qc7,b'3r4/2q4k/5nb1/1P3p1p/P4R2/2P4P/5QPK/5R2 w - -',This move disturbed me getting the feeling I'm now losing the initiative because now black is pinning down my f4 rook and threatning a pawn. But then I thought I did find a suitable move overlooking black's next one...

516,27,23,3Nd1,b'3r4/7k/6b1/1P3p1p/P1R5/7P/6PK/3n1R2 w - -',Here I saw black's Ne3 coming but didn't feel that fork of my rooks threatning because I have Rc7  and then able to save both rooks from the fork
517,27,24,3Rb1,b'3r4/2R5/1P4bk/5p1p/P7/4n2P/6PK/1R6 b - -',Now I felt very good again and thinking my opponent was right in me having a better position and now further improved
518,27,25,Nxg2,b'3r4/1PR5/6bk/7p/P4p2/7P/6nK/1R6 w - -',A sacrifice! At first I thought he was just trying to confuse me and highlighted my pawn for a move. Then I remembered a recent game I played vs. packermandan (bd=8634663) where I was in material advantage(pawn promoted to Q) but where the opponent then managed to perform perpetual check just by the use of a rook and knight making a draw. So I decided to first get rid of the knight
519,27,26,Be4+,b'3r4/1PR5/7k/7p/P3bp2/7P/6K1/1R6 w - -',This was an unpleasent move because I just have to admit black really knows how to fight for survival :-) But after looking through it again I realize this isn't really problem...

584,29,12,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/3q2p1/3p3p/p7/1n6/P1Q2N2/1RP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',A Knight withdrawal may have been more prudent.
585,29,13,2Qb3+,b'2r2rk1/3q2p1/3p3p/p7/1n6/PQ3N2/1RP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',The check was probably unexpected.  (Why don't I ever receive unexpected checks in the mail??  I could certainly use the money.)  Black's b4 Knight is now toast.
586,29,14,Rcd8,b'3r1r1k/3q2p1/7p/3p4/3Q4/5N2/1RP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Black does not want to give up the d file pawn for nothing.

588,29,16,3Rf1,b'3r1r1k/6p1/7p/3pNq2/3Q4/8/1RP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',This gives f2 extra defense - and besides I did not think the Rook was helping me all that much on d1.
589,29,17,3Rf6,b'3r3k/6p1/5r1p/3pNq2/3Q4/8/1RP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',Interesting.  I already begin thinking about Ng4.

591,29,19,Re4,b'7k/6p1/5r1p/3p1q2/3Qr1N1/7P/1RP2PP1/5RK1 w - -',A mistake.  At a minimum I should win the exchange.  The attack on the Queen does not buy time for the f6 Rook to move.  When you launch an assault against an enemy Queen it really should gain something - time material position or some combination thereof.
592,29,20,3Rb8+,b'1R5k/6p1/5r1p/3p1q2/3Qr1N1/7P/2P2PP1/5RK1 b - -',Another unexpected (most likely) check!!

594,29,22,gxf6,b'1R6/7k/5p1p/3p1q2/3Qr3/7P/2P2PP1/5RK1 w - -',Although this maintains the d file pawn it allows the following continuation.
595,29,23,3Qa7+,b'1R6/Q6k/5p1p/3p1q2/4r3/7P/2P2PP1/5RK1 b - -',I saw this position after Black's 34th move.

597,29,25,4hxg4+,b'6R1/Q7/5p1p/3p1q1k/6P1/8/2P2P2/5RK1 b - -',One good fork deserves another.
598,29,26,4Qd4+,b'8/8/5p1p/3p4/3Q2k1/8/2P2P2/5RK1 b - -',I really expected Black to resign at this point.
599,29,27,4f4,b'8/8/5k1p/3Q1p2/5P2/8/2P4K/6R1 b - f3',Allows Qe5  and limits Black's available moves.
600,29,28,4Qb7+,b'8/1Q2k3/6R1/5p1p/5P2/8/2P4K/8 b - -',And Black must withdraw to the 8th rank.

604,30,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2BP4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Non-standard.  Black should try to either block or attack the bishop with e6 or b5 although this does develop the knight.
605,30,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2BP4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Preparing to castle with knights doubled king-side.

612,30,8,Qxc5,b'r6r/p3kppp/2p1pb2/2q5/2B5/2P2P1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',The temptation is to take the Bishop but that leaves 18. Qd6  open to White.  White gets two pawns for his Bishop and can seize the d-file.  It might not work but Black would prefer to avoid the possibility.
613,30,9,2O-O,b'r2r4/p3kppp/2p1p3/4b3/8/1BP2P1P/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - -',So far Black is simplifying to take advantage of the doubled pawn.  Although Black has an isolated QBP the disadvantages should at worst cancel.  White connects his rooks and attempts to secure his King.

619,30,15,4Bxc6,b'8/p6p/2B2k2/4p3/1P2Kpp1/2P5/5b2/8 b - -',With the pawn advantage Black is willing to sacrifice the Bishop if necessary to prevent the White pawns from Queening rather than waste a move trying to save the pawn.
620,30,16,f3+,b'8/p6p/8/2P2k2/1P2p3/5pp1/5bK1/3B4 w - -',Pushing the King back.
621,30,17,g2+,b'8/p6p/8/2P2k2/1P2p3/5p2/5bp1/3B1K2 w - -',A potentially fatal mistake.  After 51. Kxf2 Kf4 52. Bxf3 ensures that Black is unable to Queen either pawn before White can Queen the c pawn.  Much better is 50. ... Kf4.  Then if 51. Bxf3 Kxf3 52. c6 g2#; or if 51. c6 e3 52. c7 g2# (52.

634,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',We are all taught how to exploit basic tactical conditions that allow us to deliver the knock-out shot in our games.  And we always see these positions from the winner's point of view.  The question I want to pose in this game annotation is the reverse  scenario:  How is it that the losing player - the player who receives the knock-out - allows the conditions for such a tactical shot to arise?  On move 32 Black delivers the tactical shot that for all intents and purposes ends the game.  But what were the oversights by the losing player (me) that allowed it?  That is what is the anatomy of a tactical oversight?

This knight is almost immovable and like an eagle it has a massive wing span hitting many of the weak squares in White's camp (e3 & c3 in particular) and on the queenside (b4 and b6).

However White's position is starting to come apart at the seams.  Simultaneously playing offence one move and defence the next move White is opening himself up for the decisive shot.   In this position the white Queen is undefended and the a4 rook  is off sides.  Notice how the centralized d5 knight prevents white from blockading the e pawn with the queen?  The knight controls the e3 square and it threatens a queen-rook fork at c3 should white move his queen to e2.

25. Nxf7  Then if ...Kg7 a suggestion like this follows (or a quicker mate):
26. Rxe6 Rxf7 27. Qxg6  Kf8 28. Qh6  Rg7 29. Rf6  Ke7 30. Qxg7  
So I felt very comfortable about Nxf7  actually this being a winning move for me. 25... Kg8 is a quick loss for black and taking back with the rook is also a loss by losing heavy material as the rest of the game shows"

799,37,30,4a4,b'8/8/p2bppp1/1p1k3p/P2P1P1P/2PK2P1/1B6/8 b - -',An interesting break but too late; black now has other targets and can allow the white a-pawn having served as a target for so long to exchange itself off. If this move had been played earlier then recapturing it would have posed a dilemma.

I annotated it to try to explain to myself why this crazy opening in which Black allows White to ransack his position early on and gain a significant material advantage actually gives Black some winning chances.  The game ended in an interesting  opposite colored bishops stalemate which makes the ending pretty interesting too.
810,38,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Looks like a standard opening...

813,38,4,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/4p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',OK.  Here we start the tourney's original position.  Black kicks the knight.
814,38,5,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4NP2/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',white chooses to target f7.  The other option is 4. Nd4 but the move chosen by White puts Black in a more stressful position because the threatened Qh5  has more venom with the knight here than on d4.  Why? because at 55 the knight puts pressure on the g6 square as well.
815,38,6,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4NP2/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Paries the Qh5  threat.

817,38,8,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4NP2/4p3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black tries to kick the white knight out.  Plus he opens the line for his c8 bishop and threatens the capture of that f5 pawn.

820,38,11,Nf7,b'rnbq1b1r/ppp1kNpp/3p1n2/5P1B/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',On top of that White has forked Black's queen and rook on move 7.  Isn't Black supposed to get some initiative since he's the one who gave up the pawn??
821,38,12,Qe8,b'rnb1qb1r/ppp1kNpp/3p1n2/5P1B/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',This move saves the queen and it doubles the attack on white's Bishop if the knight takes the rook off the board.
822,38,13,Nc3,b'rnb1qb1r/ppp1kNpp/3p1n2/5P1B/4p3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',White gets the other knight into play. Other options were to (1) 8. Nxh8 taking the rook; (2) 8. Nxd6 discovering an attack on the Black queen and later if Black liquidates queens on h5 to take the unprotected c8 bishop.
823,38,14,Nxh5,b'rnb1qb1r/ppp1kNpp/3p4/5P1n/4p3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Here Black cracks under the pressure and takes the bishop with the knight.  It might have been better to simply move the rook to g8.

828,38,19,Kg7,b'rnb1qb1r/ppp3kp/3p2P1/3N3Q/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now Black is using his opponent's pawn as shelter.
829,38,20,1Nxc7,b'rnb1qb1r/ppN3kp/3p2P1/7Q/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',and here is where I believe white played into the true spirit of Black's aims in Latvian gambit - he goes for material superiority at all costs.  It was from here on out that I began to understand this opening and why Black allows this dreadful position to arise in which none of his remaining pieces are developed his king is using the other guy's pawns as shelter and his rook is about to be taken off the table.  
830,38,21,1Qxg6,b'rnb2b1r/ppN3kp/3p2q1/7Q/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',First things first Black gets rid of that pawn and hopefully he can exchange queens to lessen the threats to his exposes king.
831,38,22,hxg6,b'rnb2b1r/ppN3k1/3p2p1/8/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Ok mission accomplished.  Now take a look at this position.  True none of Black's remaining pieces have moved from their starting positions however he has massive amounts of open lines.  By virtue of the fact that Black has only five pawns to White's seven pawns Black has open lines for his h8 rook his c8 bishop.  And though the f8 bishop is blocked in it won't be for long.   By comparison White has all of his pawns in their original positions (except for the one that took part in the gambit) and his one active piece is about to corner itself all the way back on a8.
832,38,23,1b4,b'rnb2b1r/ppN3k1/3p2p1/8/1P2p3/8/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ b3',This move serves two purposes:  it opens a line for the c1 bishop (threatening to check at b2 and win the exchange for Black's h8 rook) and it seeks to advance further to give the knight an escape after it captures on a8.
833,38,24,1Kh7,b'rnb2b1r/ppN4k/3p2p1/8/1P2p3/8/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This is the only responsible move.  Black needs to contest that a1-h8 diagonal.
834,38,25,1b5,b'rnb2b1r/ppN4k/3p2p1/1P6/4p3/8/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"Probably a bad move.  White should have played 15. Bb2 to get ""first dibs"" on that long diagonal.  His text move shows that he is too concerned with getting a free rook out of the transaction on a8.  "
835,38,26,1Bg7,b'rnb4r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1P6/4p3/8/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Obviously this is the best move.  Black gets his bishop on that nice diagonal with a gain of time since white will have to take a move to get his rook out of the way.
836,38,27,1c3,b'rnb4r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1P6/4p3/2P5/P2P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',But white chooses to close off the diagonal.   Not the best decision for two reasons:  (1) since white is less developed than Black (remember Black has lots of open lines for his pieces even though his pieces have not moved) he should encourage exchanges of material;  (2) white no longer has his light squared bishop so he will be unable to defend this light squared weaknesses he has created with this move (this is exacerbated by the fact that Black still has his light squared bishop); (3) By moving the c2 pawn to c3 white has obstructed the mobility and influence of his bishop.  It would have been better to simply exchange it.  
837,38,28,1e3,b'rnb4r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1P6/8/2P1p3/P2P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Based on the errors made in the previous two notes Black plays in the spirit of this opening and sacrifices another pawn.  This is why:  (1) that e4 pawn was simply in Black's way.  It was doing Black more harm than good.  The reason for this is that Black wants his c8 bishop mobilized to f5 to take advantage of all of those juicy light squared weaknesses.  
838,38,29,1fxe3,b'rnb4r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1P6/8/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',white has to take with the f pawn otherwise he would lose a pawn and a rook if he took with the d pawn.

840,38,31,1Nxa8,b'Nn5r/pp4bk/3p2p1/1P3b2/8/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White carries through with his material acquisitions.  Black is now down five points (equivalent to a rook).
841,38,32,1Nd7,b'N6r/pp1n2bk/3p2p1/1P3b2/8/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This was not the best move.  better was an immediate 17. ...Bd3 preventing White from castling but Black suspected that White would not castle on the next move anyway as he has played to gain that rook for free for the past several moves.
842,38,33,1Nc7,b'7r/ppNn2bk/3p2p1/1P3b2/8/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White gets the knight out unscathed.  But what has he gained for this five points?  who stands better?
843,38,34,1Bd3,b'7r/ppNn2bk/3p2p1/1P6/8/2PbP3/P2P2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black stands better because now White cannot castle and he cannot even use f1 as a post for his h1 rook ad he can't mobolize his a1 rook either.
844,38,35,2a4,b'7r/ppNn2bk/3p2p1/1P6/P7/2PbP3/3P2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ a3',So white starts to make some room for his pieces.
845,38,36,2Nc5,b'7r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1Pn5/P7/2PbP3/3P2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black moves quickly to take advantage of his superiority in development as he is down a whole rook.  This move is designed to shield the d6 pawn from white bishop that is about to jump to a3.
846,38,37,2Ba3,b'7r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1Pn5/P7/B1PbP3/3P2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',practically the only move available.
847,38,38,2Ne4,b'7r/ppN3bk/3p2p1/1P6/P3n3/B1PbP3/3P2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now Black's knight jumps to an active position and it protects the d6 pawn.
848,38,39,2Ne6,b'7r/pp4bk/3pN1p1/1P6/P3n3/B1PbP3/3P2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Good move for two reasons:  (1) it threatens Black's g7 bishop (remember that white would love to begin wholesale exchanges here so as to realize his material superiority) and (2) it takes the coveted f8 square from Black's rook. 
849,38,40,2Be5,b'7r/pp5k/3pN1p1/1P2b3/P3n3/B1PbP3/3P2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black saves jis bishop from the knight and he further reinforces that weak d6 pawn thus blunting the scope of white's a3 bishop.
850,38,41,2g3,b'7r/pp5k/3pN1p1/1P2b3/P3n3/B1PbP1P1/3P3P/R3K2R b KQ -',This was not the best as it creates a backward pawn on the half-open h-file and it allows for some tactics that favor Black.  Better was to immediately move the knight to f4 where it could have smoked out that troublesome d6 bishop and defended those light squares.
851,38,42,2g5,b'7r/pp5k/3pN3/1P2b1p1/P3n3/B1PbP1P1/3P3P/R3K2R w KQ -',This move was played to prevent the knight from occupying f4 where it would be able to block off the f-file and defend those light squares that Black has dominance over.  It would also have threatened Black's light squared bishop the crown jewel in his position.
852,38,43,2Bb4,b'7r/pp5k/3pN3/1P2b1p1/PB2n3/2PbP1P1/3P3P/R3K2R b KQ -',Now that white can't get his knight to f4 he tries to somehow mobilize his bishop to a better square.

854,38,45,2Nd4,b'7r/pp6/3p2k1/1P2b1p1/PB1Nn3/2PbP1P1/3P3P/R3K2R b KQ -',White moves the knight to e5 but it does no good from here as there is no time left to avert the following combination.
855,38,46,2Bxg3+,b'7r/pp6/3p2k1/1P4p1/PB1Nn3/2PbP1b1/3P3P/R3K2R w KQ -',The h2 pawn is pinned against the threat of checkmate.

863,38,54,2Rh1+,b'8/pp6/3B2k1/1P4p1/P2N4/2PbP1n1/3P4/R1K4r w - -',The exchange of rooks is designed to force the White King into the corner of the board - an endgame disadvantage.
864,38,55,Rxa1,b'8/pp6/3B2k1/1P4p1/P2N4/2PbP1n1/1K1P4/r7 w - -',Black figures that by forcing the white King all the way back to a1 he will have a king position advantage in the endgame.

868,38,59,3Ne4,b'8/pp6/4N1k1/1P4p1/PB2n3/2PbP3/8/K7 w - -',and here is where Black makes a decisive mistake.  He wanted to block the advance of white's e pawn thus not allowing his Bishop to have access to the queening square but in mmaking this move he allowed a worse evil:  He allows an opposite colored bishops ending which takes away his winning chances.  Had he simply advanced his pawn to g4 he would have been on the way to a clearly winning endgame.  
869,38,60,3Nc5,b'8/pp6/6k1/1PN3p1/PB2n3/2PbP3/8/K7 b - -',Excellent move in that white forces an exchange of knights.  
870,38,61,a6,b'8/1p6/p5k1/1PB3p1/P7/2PbP3/8/K7 w - -',Black played this move with a defensive mindset - He was feeling the effects of his higher-rated opponent's endgame skills and he wanted to make it harder on him to clear a path for his queenside pawns.

874,38,65,3Be4,b'8/8/p5k1/2B3p1/P3b3/2P1P3/1K6/8 w - -',A bad move - Black should have advanced the pawn.  what is the value in securing the queening square if his pawn never gets there? 
875,38,66,3Kb3,b'8/8/p5k1/2B3p1/P3b3/1KP1P3/8/8 b - -',Black does not have much time left and he's allowed his presious passed pawn to sit idle for about 5 moves!
876,38,67,3Kh5,b'8/8/p7/2B3pk/P3b3/1KP1P3/8/8 w - -',Black  moved his king here to that he could get get in front of the pawn.  If he were to advance the pawn first then White could move his bishop to e7 to take away the h4 square from my king.
877,38,68,3Kb4,b'8/8/p7/2B3pk/PK2b3/2P1P3/8/8 b - -',White plays very methodically with a clear goal in mind.
878,38,69,3Kg4,b'8/8/p7/2B3p1/PK2b1k1/2P1P3/8/8 w - -',Black continues trying to advance the king in front of his pawn.
879,38,70,4Be7,b'8/4B3/p7/6p1/PK2b1k1/2P1P3/8/8 b - -',Good move - white further frustrates the Black king's efforts to escort the pawn.  Black can't use the f4 square and if he moves my king to h4 then the pawn is pinned.
880,38,71,4Kh5,b'8/4B3/p7/6pk/PK2b3/2P1P3/8/8 w - -',Now Black has to back-track to let the pawn go first.
881,38,72,4Ka5,b'8/4B3/p7/K5pk/P3b3/2P1P3/8/8 b - -',White is clearly winning now.  Black has to fight for a draw.  
882,38,73,4Bb7,b'8/1b2B3/p7/K5pk/P7/2P1P3/8/8 w - -',Black tries to salvage the a pawn.
883,38,74,4e4,b'8/1b2B3/p7/K5pk/P3P3/2P5/8/8 b - -',White offers the e pawn to clear the way for the a pawn.
884,38,75,4g4,b'8/1b2B3/p7/K6k/P3P1p1/2P5/8/8 w - -',Black refuses the offer as the game depends on frustrating Whites efforts to queen the a-pawn.  
885,38,76,4e5,b'8/1b2B3/p7/K3P2k/P5p1/2P5/8/8 b - -',It is looking pretty bad for Black now.
886,38,77,4g3,b'8/1b2B3/p7/K3P2k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 w - -',Black plays the only card he has left.
887,38,78,4e6,b'8/1b2B3/p3P3/K6k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 b - -',white keeps the e pawn coming.  Now Black is starting to see the gravity of this situation...
888,38,79,4Bd5,b'8/4B3/p3P3/K2b3k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 w - -',Black decides to take the e-pawn and deal with the a-pawn later.
889,38,80,4Kxa6,b'8/4B3/K3P3/3b3k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 b - -',Mission accomplished for White!
890,38,81,4Bxe6,b'8/4B3/K3b3/7k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 w - -',Now it is a two against one pawn majority in an opposite colored bishops game.  Black does jis best to save the game by getting his king into a useful position and by taking advantage of the Bishop's ability to occupy both of white's queening squares.
891,38,82,4Kb5,b'8/4B3/4b3/1K5k/P7/2P3p1/8/8 b - -',white clears the path for the a-pawn

897,38,88,4Bh2,b'8/5k2/4b3/PK6/8/2P5/6pB/8 b - -',And white puts his bishop on the best square.  The other diagonal (g1-a7) would not have been as good because he wants to occupy the squares between the Black king and the white pawns).

901,38,92,5Kb6,b'8/4k3/1K6/P7/2b5/2P5/6pB/8 b - -',White allows Black's king in but he wants to get that a-pawn moving as that is the key to his winning chances.
902,38,93,5Kd8,b'3k4/8/1K6/P7/2b5/2P5/6pB/8 w - -',Black takes the time to get better king position.
903,38,94,5a6,b'3k4/8/PK6/8/2b5/2P5/6pB/8 b - -',Not the best move - White should have mobilized his king down to b8 - a safe square and one that would allow the queening of his pawn.
904,38,95,5Kc8,b'2k5/8/PK6/8/2b5/2P5/6pB/8 w - -',Better king position.
905,38,96,5a7,b'2k5/P7/1K6/8/2b5/2P5/6pB/8 b - -',The pawn no longer has any support after Black's next move.
906,38,97,5Bd5,b'2k5/P7/1K6/3b4/8/2P5/6pB/8 w - -',White cannot queen the a-pawn now.
907,38,98,5c4,b'2k5/P7/1K6/3b4/2P5/8/6pB/8 b - -',White advances his other pawn - there is no way Black would take it of course.  The bishop is needed at every second to watch over a8.
