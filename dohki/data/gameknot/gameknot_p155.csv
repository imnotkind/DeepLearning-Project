There's an old game Spielmann vs. Eliskases (1932) -- link here: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1040762 -- where if black plays gxf5 on his 12th move white gets a mate in exactly this fashion.  Somehow I thought of that tactic in this position."

But this move carries -- at least I saw -- the immediate threat of Bxb7 where white achieves (at least) material equality and a superior position to boot.
15,0,15,1h3,b'r1b1kb1r/1p1n1p2/p3pP1p/q7/3N4/2N2B1p/P1PQ2PP/1R3RK1 w kq -',Well after this move and a little thought maybe that's not exactly true!  After 17. Bxb7 Bxb7 18. Rxb7 I realized I don't have a good answer to Qc5!  But white does have a shot...
16,0,16,1Nd5,b'r1b1kb1r/1p1n1p2/p3pP1p/q2N4/3N4/5B1p/P1PQ2PP/1R3RK1 b kq -',"!!  I'm not sure but I think this is the best move I've ever played.

White offers his QUEEN for what must be an all-out attack.  The only reasonable way to decline the sacrifice that I've found is Qc5 as Qd8 runs into the nightmarish Nxe6 and all other moves either result in her capture or a loss of material after something like Nc7+."

37,2,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Standard Stuff
38,2,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Still nothing unusual
39,2,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',I play the Grunfeld.
40,2,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',4. Nf3 is less common than cxd5 but perfectly playable. One can transpose into the other.
41,2,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',I knew White had a little combination here to win a pawn but Black gets counterplay.
42,2,5,Nxd5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',So White plays it. Note that White cannot transpose into the main line of the Grunfeld Exchange variation with 7. e4?? because of NxBf4. I have had an opponent play that a drop a Bishop!
43,2,6,Qxd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3q4/3P1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',White continues with his plan
44,2,7,Bg4,b'rn3rk1/ppB1ppbp/6p1/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',"I am actually far more familiar with this gambit when White has played e3 rather than Nf3. 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxc7 
Then Black can regain the pawn with Na6 9. Bxa6 Qxg2 10. Qf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 bxa6 
I was thinking for myself now! Looking at the Databases afterwards I see that 8. Bg4 is not best in this position either Nc6 or Na6 seems better."
45,2,8,Na6,b'r4rk1/ppB1ppbp/n5p1/3q4/3P2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',If played a move earlier White can't take this knight of course. This move is not on the database Nc6 is the only move which is. After the game I compared my moves with the computer recommendation. Computer does like Na6 and assesses the position as equal.
46,2,9,bxa6,b'r4rk1/p1B1ppbp/p5p1/3q4/3P2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Best moves for both sides.
47,2,10,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/p1B1ppbp/p5p1/3q4/3P2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Computer also likes Qb2 here winning back the pawn. I didn't see it! Computer also quite likes my move. Black has got compensation for the pawn here.
48,2,11,Rc6,b'5rk1/p3ppbp/p1r3p1/3q4/3P2b1/4PNB1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Computer likes these moves.
49,2,12,Bh5,b'5rk1/p3ppbp/p1r3p1/3q3b/3P4/4PNBP/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',With the Bishop on g3 I can afford to keep my Bishop a bit longer. Computer agrees with me.
50,2,13,Rfc8,b'2r3k1/p3ppbp/p1r3p1/3q3b/3P4/4PNBP/PP3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',I was beginning to like my position. How is he going to contest c file? The White queen can only go to e2 otherwise he loses a pawn on f3. He can't move his Ra1 without the pawn on a2 going. Computer agrees with my move but thinks White is slightly better.
51,2,14,Qd8,b'2rq2k1/p3ppbp/p1r3p1/7b/3PP3/5NBP/PP3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',I wanted to keep up the pressure on the d pawn. I did consider Qa5 too. The computer likes Qb5 and considers the resulting position equal.
52,2,15,Bxf3,b'2rq2k1/p3ppbp/p1r3p1/4B3/3PP3/5b1P/PP3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',I thought I could win back the pawn here if he took back with the queen. Once again I overlooked a move!
53,2,16,f6,b'2rq2k1/p3p1bp/p1r2pp1/4B3/3PP3/5Q1P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Right now he has to move the Bishop then I take the d pawn with my queen. I bet you can see what I missed and what he played next move. Easy to see when you have someone hinting that something is on! Harder to see a couple of moves back when I exchanged on f3.
54,2,17,Rc6c4,b'2rq2k1/p3p1bp/p4pp1/3PB3/2r1P3/5Q1P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Of course! Now if I had played Rc2 after Bc3 my rook is trapped. Computer agrees with my move and thinks White is +1.57. I have to agree!

perhaps black should have focused on developing his queenside knight b4 starting the attack especially since white's queen was stuck on defense duty (btw queen and rook don't like defense at all...they usually try to bully bishops and knights to do it for them)

personally i've found it useful to let queen and rooks defend lesser pieces and take advantage of opponent's greed for the less powerful pieces (effectively disabling the more powerful ones in many cases)"

Two ideas and a only move must be strong. Jugué este movimiento con la idea de colocar el alfil de casillas claras en f5 atacando c2 junto con el caballo y defender mi caballo con la dama. Dos ideas en una sola jugada debe de ser buena.
182,6,14,Bf5,b'r2qr1k1/ppp1bppp/5n2/5b2/2Bn4/P7/1P2NPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Now Black has a winning position but the next move is a blunder best is Bb3.

187,7,2,bxc6,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Regarding my previous comment I may should have played ...Bxc6 to be less cramped. Still I wanted to keep as much pieces on the board as possible avoiding drawish tendencies. Now I have a solid center without need to spend time on ...a6.
188,7,3,1Bb3,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I regard this a waste of time and would have let the bishop on d7 bound to it's mundane task to keep an eye on c6. I was expecting a kingside attack by f4 g4 g5 etc.
189,7,4,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',A somewhat tame move but I guess a neccessity because my knight will be under attack soon and the bishop on e7 is in doubled duty of defending Nf6 and Pd6.
190,7,5,1Qd3,b'r4rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Yes a good square for the queen. My opponent plays this as a positional game alltogether. Quite in alliance with his 9th move. The goal seems to increase pressure on my d-pawn forcing it to move thereby making e5 possible.
191,7,6,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I am not that happy with this move anymore. There is an open file so I seize it was my motiv. The b-pawn could become a target in the long run.
192,7,7,1h3,b'1r3rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',So white doesn't want to abandon the idea of a kingside pawn storm completely. By 12. Qd3 a possible g4 lacks support.
193,7,8,1Rfd8,b'1r1r2k1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Further backing of the d-pawn.

197,7,12,Bxf6,b'1r1r2k1/2qb1pp1/3ppb1p/p1p5/4P3/1BNQ3P/PPP2PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',With the h-pawn on h6 I did not want to take back with my g-pawn. 
198,7,13,Qxd6,b'1r1r2k1/3b1pp1/3qpb1p/p1p5/4P3/1BN4P/PPP2PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',My blunder has had another negative side effect: Being down in material I wanted to steer the game into drawish channels as soon as possible. Exchanging queens seemed to fit the bill. But now I see 18. ...Da7 19. Qg3 a4 20. Bc4 Rxb2 was a better option. I was afraid of the aggressive image of white given after 21. e5 Be7 and then 22. Ne4!

203,7,18,a4,b'3r2k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/4b3/p1B1P3/7P/PrP1NPP1/4R1K1 w - -',One of the pawns on c2 and a2 is doomed anyway. So I invest a tempo to save my a-pawn. A draw is within reach.
204,7,19,2Rd1,b'3r2k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/4b3/p1B1P3/7P/PrP1NPP1/3R2K1 b - -',This seemingly terrifying pin had to be checked beforehand of course. (Note that Ra7 would be lethal.)
205,7,20,2Rc8,b'2r3k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/4b3/p1B1P3/7P/PrP1NPP1/3R2K1 w - -',But my play does work for the attackable bishop on c4 plus his second rank is more vulnerable than mine.
206,7,21,2Bd3,b'2r3k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/4b3/p3P3/3B3P/PrP1NPP1/3R2K1 b - -',He reacts reasonable.

I often complain about the phenomenon in chess that you can seemingly gain an advantage in the early middlegame that turns out to be a disadvantage some tens of moves later. (And I will do so in my next annotations ;) But this is one of the few times I was in favour of this curiosity: All of a sudden my pieces are somewhat more active than his.
208,7,23,2f4,b'2r3k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/4b3/p3PP2/3B3P/r1P1N1P1/3R2K1 b - f3',The obvious move.
209,7,24,2Bb2,b'2r3k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/8/p3PP2/3B3P/rbP1N1P1/3R2K1 w - -',The not so obvious reply. My idea here is to keep control over a1 in order to exchange rooks.
210,7,25,2Kh2,b'2r3k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/8/p3PP2/3B3P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 b - -',With the pieces in a nearly funny kind of stalemate it's time for king moves positioning for the endgame.
211,7,26,2Kf8,b'2r2k2/3b1pp1/R3p2p/8/p3PP2/3B3P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 w - -',Sneaking towards e7. Frankly I wasn't seeing something better than to fortify my weak center squares on my second rank.
212,7,27,2Ra7,b'2r2k2/R2b1pp1/4p2p/8/p3PP2/3B3P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 b - -',He had access over my second rank since a couple of moves but now decides to eventually seize the control. Maybe my king move was drawing his attention?
213,7,28,2Be8,b'2r1bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p3PP2/3B3P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 w - -',Everything else looked too dangerous to me with the rook on d1 eyeing through his bishop.
214,7,29,2Ba6,b'2r1bk2/R4pp1/B3p2p/8/p3PP2/7P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 b - -',Time to get active again ending the hibernate.
215,7,30,2Rb8,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/B3p2p/8/p3PP2/7P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 w - -',The only square. And not a bad one. I was having visions of doubled rooks on the second rank myself.
216,7,31,2Bc4,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p1B1PP2/7P/rbP1N1PK/3R4 b - -',That vision might have occured to him as well. So he forces my rook off that rank.
217,7,32,2Ra3,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p1B1PP2/r6P/1bP1N1PK/3R4 w - -',Actually I was prepared to swap rooks along the way (...Ra1) but with the bishop off d3 I checked another path. Maybe he doesn't notice? After Bd3 there is no future for the rook on a3 and I would have exchanged it on a1 in the long run whatsoever.
218,7,33,3Rb1,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p1B1PP2/r6P/1bP1N1PK/1R6 b - -',Luckily he didn't notice. I can boldly place my rook to an unexpected square. His move looks natural but it was mandatory to prevent...
219,7,34,3Re3,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p1B1PP2/4r2P/1bP1N1PK/1R6 w - -',This looks to be a vulnerable square for the rook. But all my variations on my chess board confirmed me it was save so I thought. I figured white can't approach the rook with the king for a nasty tactic.
220,7,35,3Bd3,b'1r2bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/p3PP2/3Br2P/1bP1N1PK/1R6 b - -',Very naturally locking the rook and defending the pawn. White lusts for my rook.
221,7,36,3Rb4,b'4bk2/R4pp1/4p2p/8/pr2PP2/3Br2P/1bP1N1PK/1R6 w - -',This move allows ...a3 which would not have been possible otherwise: ...a3 fails to Rxa3 with the rook on b8.
222,7,37,3Ra8,b'R3bk2/5pp1/4p2p/8/pr2PP2/3Br2P/1bP1N1PK/1R6 b - -',Immediately seizing the opportunity to pin my bishop along the eighth rank. I guess this is best.

The rook can only be approached by g3 Kg2 and finally Kf2. This could only be countered by giving the rook for bishop and pawn: ...Rexe4 Bxe4 ...Rxe4.

The white king must not set foot on dark squares for the 'discovered attack' set up by the Bb2 and Rb4 against the undefended Rook on b1. This is beginner's level."

228,7,43,3Rxa3,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/8/3bPP2/R6P/2P1B1PK/1r6 b - -',I guess by winning this bothersome pawn and having a passed pawn on his own he still sensed some chances.
229,7,44,3Bg4,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/8/3bPPB1/R6P/2P3PK/4r3 b - -',Puzzled. I can only explain this further present of a pawn that he was getting tired of making solid but passive moves. This is equal to resignation.
230,7,45,3c4,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/8/2PbrPB1/R6P/6PK/8 b - c3',So he is putting all his hopes on his passed pawn and measures tempo over material. Alas this doesn't work here.
231,7,46,3Rxf4,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/8/2Pb1rB1/R6P/6PK/8 w - -',Since the passed pawn is too little supported I can savely take all material offered.
232,7,47,3Ra5,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/R7/2Pb1rB1/7P/6PK/8 b - -',Well the rook belongs behind the passed pawn.
233,7,48,4g3,b'4bk2/5pp1/4p2p/R7/2P2rB1/6PP/5b1K/8 b - -',I guess he has morally given up and this is just a hasty blunder.

269,10,2,d4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3pP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',In compensation for the white pawn black has given white a pair of doubled pawns and gained a small amount of space with his d pawn but it definitely doesn't feel sufficient magnified by the weakness of the light squares.
270,10,3,f6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4P3/2BpP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Not exactly the prettiest of moves or one I'd even remotely considered to be honest. The kingside light squares prove to be very rickety following this. I considered trying to outright punish the weird looking f6 with e6 but eventually decided to just continue with basic development and pressure whilst letting black's weaknesses win the game for me.
271,10,4,h6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp4p1/5p1p/2p1P3/2BpP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',This move pretty much finishes things though they were only headed one way regardless to be honest. The light squares are now completely indefensible. Much more sensible was Nc6. Qc7 with the idea of forcing white to resolve the tension in the pawn structure is falling short against exf6 Nxf6 e5 Ng8 Bf4 where black's pieces are all still asleep with white ready to finish the game. The continuations with Nc6 are much less dramatic with White simply intending to improve his position with Bf4 and Re1 before capturing on f6 and playing e5 N.B The idea of Bf4 is to prevent a swap off of queens after exf6 Qxf6 in the future and keep the most amount of firepower on the board to exploit black's weaknesses.

Qh5+ has pointed out to me the move Bf7+ which I'm actually rather annoyed with myself for missing. Nethertheless Black's position does pretty much fold here so it's easy to see winning lines and not press in searching for alternatives

409,16,8,Qg4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/4n1Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Normally a Queen move this early is bad but this one has a disorganizing effect on Black's position. He now must move or defend his Knight and because of White's KP he has few options.
410,16,9,Nxf2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/6Q1/2P5/PP3nPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',The only safe square.

413,16,12,Bg5,b'rnbqkr2/pppp1pQp/8/2b1P1B1/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR b KQq -',Now Morphy attacks the trapped Q.

416,16,15,Rxf6,b'rnbqk3/pppp2Qp/5r2/2b3B1/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR w KQq -',Desperate Black gives up his Rook in an attempt to break the attack.
417,16,16,Bxf6,b'rnbqk3/pppp2Qp/5B2/2b5/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR b KQq -',Morphy's attack loses none of its force.

420,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Midway into this game white had the advantage of piece position and tempo.  White could exert strong influence on black's side of the board.  However through a few false moves white allowed black to turn back his intrusions into the black side.  Once black gained the upper hand black was able to threaten mate and force white to resign.
421,17,1,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/4P2P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White opens with a defensive position instead of with offensive moves.
422,17,2,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/2P1P2P/PP3PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Another defensive move by white.  A major disadvantage to playing defensively is allowing the opponent to push forward and hence push back one's own pieces.  The result is that a defensive player gets boxed inside his own pawns.
423,17,3,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p1n2n2/3p4/2PP4/4P2P/PP3PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This seems odd.  Why move pawn two steps in two moves when white could have just moved the pawn two steps in the first move.  Every move counts during initial development and the prior move seems like a wasted action.
424,17,4,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1nbpn2/8/2BP4/2N1PN1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Much better development now for both sides.  Each side is just one move away from castling - and has enough pieces in place to launch tactical strikes.

426,17,6,1Bb3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p1nbpn2/1p6/3PP3/1BN2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The bishop went to b3.  A stronger move is to pull the bishop back to d3.  With the bishop on d3 white could have protected the e4 pawn and once the queen is on c2 white can push the e4 pawn towards the knight on f6.  Once that knight is out of the way white's bishop can take out the h7 pawn for free and expose black's king.
427,17,7,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p1nbpn2/8/1p1PP3/1BN2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Now the pawn gets to scare the knight away.

429,17,9,1bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p1nbpn2/4P3/3P4/1Bp2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black has two basic choices - either play aggressively or defensively. Aggressively is to take out the knight on c3 and disrupt white's pawn structure.  Defensively is to to move the d6 bishop or f6 knight to safety.  Since both knight and bishop are threatened by the same piece any safety is just an illusion since the safety of one means the death of the other.  If white's pawn captures either black's bishop or knight the pawn is left undefended on the next move.  Seeing that - and seeing a way to disrupt white's own pawn structure - the best defense is a good offense!  Black's pawn removes the knight.
430,17,10,1exd6,b'r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p1nPpn2/8/3P4/1Bp2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Now the choice is either take out another defensive pawn of white's or take out the offensive white pawn on d6.  Better to take out the white d6 pawn with the c7 pawn in order to have a good pawn structure for defense later.  In this move the best offense (later) is a good defense (now).
431,17,11,1bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/p1nppn2/8/3P4/1BP2N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Black now has a slight advantage in pawn position.  White has 3 pawn islands while black has only 2.

435,17,15,1Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1n1ppp/p3pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2PQ1N1P/P1B2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Time to bring in reinforcements for the besieged f6 knight.

However it will eventually lead to white gaining a piece since white can take out the knight on d7 and if black recaptures the d7 square with the queen the unlucky knight on c6 is left unprotected by anybody.
438,17,18,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/1b1q1p1p/p3pBp1/3p4/3P4/2PQ3P/P1B2PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',White is now ahead by 3 points.

444,17,24,2Kh7,b'r4r2/3q1p1k/p3pBp1/3p2Qp/3P4/2P4P/P1B2PP1/R4bK1 w - -',White's king must move to protect the h6 square from intrusion by the queen.

446,17,26,2fxg6,b'r4r2/3q3k/p3pBp1/3p2Qp/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/R4bK1 w - -',Now white is down a piece and a pawn.  His remaining bishop is threatened.
447,17,27,2Rxf1,b'r4r2/3q3k/p3pBp1/3p2Qp/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 b - -',Okay so white somewhat evens the score and is only down a pawn.  If white had not taken the black bishop on this move I might have pulled the bishop back to d3 and then placed it on f5 to guard the two pawns on e and g columns.
448,17,28,2Be5,b'r4r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB1Qp/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 b - -',The black queen scared the white bishop back.
449,17,29,2Qf5,b'r4r2/7k/p3p1p1/3pBqQp/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 w - -',Now the black queen tries to scare the white queen away from the king.
450,17,30,2Qe7+,b'r4r2/4Q2k/p3p1p1/3pBq1p/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 b - -',Nope the white queen is not scared away. Instead she goes on the offensive behind enemy lines.
451,17,31,2Qf7,b'r4r2/4Qq1k/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 w - -',Black once again tries to force a queen exchange to protect the king.  An alternate move was moving the f8 rook to f7 to convince the white queen to flee to the queen side of the board.  The disadvantage of that move is that the black rooks are no longer giving each other mutual support.
452,17,32,2Qh4,b'r4r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P3Q/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 b - -',The queen flees at last.
453,17,33,2Rac8,b'2r2r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P3Q/2P4P/P4PP1/5RK1 w - -',Black threatens to pick off an easy pawn and move a rook to where it can influence events behind white's pawn line.
454,17,34,2g4,b'2r2r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P2PQ/2P4P/P4P2/5RK1 b - g3',Nice move but it comes 6 moves too late.  Black need not fear white pawn taking the h5 pawn this time since black has a pawn a queen defending it. Also if white takes it and black retakes h5 with the g6 pawn the g column is completely open to a rook attack on white's king.
455,17,35,2Rxc3,b'5r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P2PQ/2r4P/P4P2/5RK1 w - -',Black ignores the pawn threat against h5 and picks off the free pawn on c3.
456,17,36,3gxh5,b'5r2/5q1k/p3p1p1/3pB2P/3P3Q/2r4P/P4P2/5RK1 b - -',Now black must respond to the white pawn on h5.  If h5xg6+! then white gets a double check against black's king and the pawn gets to fork queen and king.  Not a pleasant situation so black must retake h5.
457,17,37,3Kh2,b'5r2/5q1k/p3p3/3pB2p/3P3Q/2r4P/P4P1K/5R2 b - -',Now white moves the king to protect the white pawn on h3.  This leaves black with several options.  One is Qf5 and another is Qf3 - both of which threaten the h3 pawn and protect the h5 pawn.  While each is tempting black can counter either by moving Bg3 to block the rook on c3.
458,17,38,3Rg8,b'6r1/5q1k/p3p3/3pB2p/3P3Q/2r4P/P4P1K/5R2 w - -',Black has an another idea.  First move rook to wide open g column and then move queen to same column in order to mate white's king on g2.
459,17,39,3f4,b'6r1/5q1k/p3p3/3pB2p/3P1P1Q/2r4P/P6K/5R2 b - f3',I don't think this was a good move.  It prevents white's bishop from influencing events near the white king.  I still think Bg3 was far better.
460,17,40,3Qg6,b'6r1/7k/p3p1q1/3pB2p/3P1P1Q/2r4P/P6K/5R2 w - -',Black moves the queen into position for checkmate.
461,17,41,3Qe7+,b'6r1/4Q2k/p3p1q1/3pB2p/3P1P2/2r4P/P6K/5R2 b - -',A last ditch attempt by white to distract black.  Black can just move the king out of harm's way and this leaves white's queen far away from where she offer protection to her king.
462,17,42,3Qg5+,b'6r1/8/p3p1qk/3pB1Qp/3P1P2/2r4P/P6K/5R2 b - -',Now that black has the advantage white presses for a queen exchange to prevent mate.
463,17,43,3Qxg5,b'6r1/8/p3p2k/3pB1qp/3P1P2/2r4P/P6K/5R2 w - -',Seeing the advantage in material black accepts the queen exchange.
464,17,44,3fxg5+,b'6r1/8/p3p2k/3pB1Pp/3P4/2r4P/P6K/5R2 b - -',If black took the pawn with king then white could have put black in check and skewer the rook once the king moves out of the way.  It's far better to take this pawn out with a rook - which also limits the white king's options.
465,17,45,3Rf6+,b'8/8/p3pR1k/3pB1rp/3P4/2r4P/P6K/8 b - -',Another attempt at checking the king to delay the inevitable.

Generally capturing with a piece is the right way to go but I felt that the placement of White's light-squared bishop would require White to spend enough tempi so as to allow Black to untangle his minor pieces and secure a safe place for his king. The mainline I had calculated was a4 Be6 Ng5 Bf5 c3 (the point behind the double bishop move was to play for Nd4) g6. Where White' knight on g5 prevents the bishop from locating there in time to prevent Bg7 and 0-0.

893,38,18,1Kd7,b'3rr3/N1pk1ppp/2pb4/3n3q/3P2b1/P3BN2/1P2BPPP/3QK2R w K -',...he moves here seeking shelter among his cluster of pieces.
894,38,19,1Ne5+,b'3rr3/N1pk1ppp/2pb4/3nN2q/3P2b1/P3B3/1P2BPPP/3QK2R b K -',The winning stroke. If Taubenhaus gives back the Exchange with 15... RxN 16 PxR he is behind a Pawn and Mieses' passed QRP gives him a winning advantage in an end game. If Taubenhaus moves his K to the King file 16 NxB wins a piece. So Taubenhaus resigns at once.
895,39,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is an interesting draw with moments of drama! Anyway he opens e4 and I play my usual Sicilian
896,39,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"2. c3 is slightly unusual but perfectly playable. I believe the Deep Blue Computer famously beat Kasparov with it in 1996 - the first game to be won by a chess-playing computer against a reigning world champion under normal chess tournament conditions and in particular normal time controls.

897,39,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1p3/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',3. d3 is not as aggressive - and not as good for that matter - as the standard 3. e5. I was tempted to play d5 and expected in reply either 4. Nd2 or 4. e5 Nf6-d7 and after a later d4 by white we will go into a position similar to a variation of the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence(1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7) where Black has an extra tempo because White has wasted a move by playing d3 and then d4. I thought at the time that Black would struggle to make the extra tempo count in a blocked position. I went for something more ambition. But wrongly! After the game a glance at the Gameknot World Database shows d5 was the better move.
898,39,3,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/2p1p1B1/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',There is already only a few moves on either the Gameknot World or the Gameknot internal opening database with this position.
899,39,4,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/5b2/2p1p3/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I really don't understand this unforced exchange of minor pieces by White. On the databases I can only find games with 5. Nf6. However Black seems to have the better of those games.
900,39,5,d5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5b2/2ppp3/4P3/2PP4/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq d6',So having the two bishops I wanted to break open the centre and give scope to my bishops. I was a bit afraid of him closing up the centre with 7. c4 ruling out ....d5 for ever. I thought that in that position his knights may be at least equal to my bishops. Computer seems to prefer Nc6 or 0-0 and black stands slightly better. What do you think dear reader?
901,39,6,Qxd5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5b2/2pqp3/8/2PP4/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',So of course I saw that his knight can come to e4 with gain of time. But what of it? I can then play f5 with gain of time. In the meantime he has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file I have the 2 bishops and more space. What more could one want after just 7 moves? Compute prefers 7. Qb3 but Black still slightly better 
902,39,7,Be7,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bppp/8/2pqp3/4N3/2PP4/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Computer agrees I can't allow an exchange on f6.
903,39,8,Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pqp3/4N3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Normal developing moves. Computer agrees with both.
904,39,9,f5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pqpp2/4N3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq f6',So I continue with my plan. Computer agrees with both his move and mine and assesses the position as better for Black.
905,39,10,h5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1p1/2n5/2pqpp1p/8/2PP1NN1/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq h6',Now this is where I started to over-estimate my position again. I thouhght that if he castles h4 and his knight is forced back to h1 where is has no influence. I can follow with moves like Be6 0-0-0 and g5 and a ready-made attack on his castled King. On the other hand I thought that 12. h4 would virtually rule out King side castling for him and is pawn on h4 could prove weak. Computer prefers the simple 0-0.
906,39,11,Be6,b'r3k2r/pp2b1p1/2n1b3/2pqpp1p/7P/2PP1NN1/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Computer agrees with both these moves and Black only slightly better.
907,39,12,Bxg5,b'r3k2r/pp4p1/2n1b3/2pqppbp/7P/2PP2N1/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Computer agrees with 13. Ng5 and gives 13..... 0-0-0 as a good alternative to Bxg5
908,39,13,g6,b'r3k2r/pp6/2n1b1p1/2pqppPp/8/2PP2N1/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I had been worried about 14. Bxh5+ and computer agrees it is a better move for White although it thinks Black still has a slight advantage. It prefers 0-0-0 to g6 - if he takes on h5 I can take on g2 and gives h4 as an alternative. No marks of course for an immediate 14.... Qxg6?? Losing the queen to Bf3 - as I noticed in the game.
909,39,14,Qd7,b'r3k2r/pp1q4/2n1b1p1/2p1ppPp/8/2PP1BN1/PP3PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Computer likes 15. Bf3 but prefers Black to drop the queen back to d6. I'm not sure it makes much difference.
910,39,15,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1q4/2n1b1p1/2p1ppPp/8/2PP1BN1/PP2QPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Computer prefers 16. Qa4. It agrees with my queen side castling and thinks this position is better for Black.
911,39,16,Bxa2,b'2kr3r/pp1q4/2n3p1/2p1ppPp/8/2PP1BN1/bP2QPP1/2KR3R w - -',Round about here I could have lost the game! My mobile phone went off and I rushed out of the palying area to answer it. Afterwards the Gameknot player frebec who also plays in the same over-the-board tem pointed out that my opponent could have claimed the game. It was my live-in girl friend she had forgotten I had a chess game. She asked me when I would be back. I told her it depended on how long the game went on for. She told me to try to be quick!
912,39,17,Qxc6,b'2kr3r/pp6/2q3p1/2p1ppPp/8/2PP2N1/bP2QPP1/2KR3R w - -',Round about here I started having mental aberations. I thought he wil take on e5 I play Bb6 he moves the rook then Qa5 and I am mating him and I will be back home with be beloved like she wanted! I completely missed his rather obvious defence!
913,39,18,Bb3,b'2kr3r/pp6/2q3p1/2p1QpPp/8/1bPP2N1/1P3PP1/2KR3R w - -',Computer prefers 19. Rd1-e1 although Black is clearly winning. It prefers Rh8-e8 and Black is winning. Gosh I could have been home early!
914,39,19,Qa4,b'2kr3r/pp6/6p1/2p1QpPp/q7/1bPP2N1/1P1R1PP1/2K4R w - -',"Again simply Rh8-e8 first and Black really is winning. I forgot the old bit of advice ""if you see a good move sit on your hands and look for a better one""."
915,39,20,Kb8,b'1k1r3r/pp6/6p1/2Q2pPp/q7/1bPP2N1/1P1R1PP1/2K4R w - -',Of course now the white queen gets back to defend.
916,39,21,Qb5,b'1k1r3r/pp6/6p1/1q3pPp/8/QbPP2N1/1P1R1PP1/2K4R w - -',Now I am a pawn down but I do have some compensation. My bishop is much better than his knight my pieces are in attacking positions. Of course being a pawn down I don't want to exchange queens. Computer agrees with me but gives advantage to White.
917,39,22,Rhe8,b'1k1rr3/pp6/6p1/1q3pPp/3P4/QbP3N1/1P1R1PP1/2K4R w - -',Computer prefers Ne2 to d4 and it is probably right. From e2 it is threatening to go to d4 and fork my queen and bishop. I wasn't threatening to take on d3 and after he exchanges rooks my bishop on b3 goes. now he can't move the knight. Computer now gives the position as even.
918,39,23,Qd5,b'1k1rr3/pp6/6p1/3q1pPp/1Q1P4/1bP3N1/1P1R1PP1/2K4R w - -',So he tries again to exchange queens and I avoid again. Computer agrees with the basic plan but prefers 24. Qc5. It also prefers 24...QxQb4 25. cxQb4 Rc8+ 26. Kb1 f4 27. Ne2 Rc2 28. RxRc2 BxRc2+ 29. KxBc2 RxNe2+ with the better ending for Black. I was looking at variations like that but missed 27.....Rc2!
919,39,24,Rdc8,b'1kr1r3/pp6/6p1/3q1pPp/1Q1P4/1bP2PN1/1P1R2P1/2K4R w - -',Played with the idea that his pawn on d4 is going to be pinned in some variation and that I may be able to take on d4 - as indeed I do in the game. Computer likes f3 doesn't like my move prefers Bc4 and claims that the position is equal.
920,39,25,a5,b'1kr1r3/1p6/6p1/p2q1pPp/1Q1P4/1bP2PN1/1P2R1P1/2K4R w - a6',As I said I had a plan to win his d pawn. Instead the computer prefers exchanging on e2 followed by Qe6 and white stands slightly better. Computer also prefers 26. Ne2 to 26. Re2
921,39,26,Qxd4,b'1kr1r3/1p6/6p1/p4pPp/3q4/QbP2PN1/1P2R1P1/2K4R w - -',27. Qa3 is forced. Computer prefers the exchange on e2 or h4 rather than taking the pawn on d4.
922,39,27,Qf4+,b'1kr1r3/1p6/6p1/p4pPp/5q2/1QP2PN1/1P2R1P1/2K4R w - -',I had looked at another variation - 29.... Rxe2 30. Nxe2 Qe3 31. Kd1 Rd1+ 32. Ke1 Rd2 but after 33. Qb5 White seems to be holding and consolidating his extra piece. Computer actually prefers that line and assesses it as equal.
923,39,28,Qxg3,b'1kr1r3/1p6/6p1/p4pPp/8/1QP2Pq1/1P2R1P1/1K5R w - -',Both moves more of less forced. So we have returned to material equality but I have given up my good bishop and he has got rid of his bad knight.
924,39,29,Rxe2,b'1kr5/1p6/6p1/p4pPp/8/1QP2Pq1/1P2r1P1/1K2R3 w - -',Now instead of exchanging on e2 I did look at Qxe1+ 31. Rxe1 Rxe1+ and Black has two rooks for the queen. 32. Ka2 looks best and I thought on the open board the queen is as good as the two rooks my pawns on g6 and a5 look weak. I looked at 32.... Rc8-d8 with ideas of going to d1 but they didn't see that good White seems to have defences. Computer actually rates this line as much better for Black but gives 32....Rc6 I guess that if necessary it can go to a6 and protect both pawns. I'm still not convinced that is it good. What do you think dear reader?
925,39,30,Qxg5,b'1kr5/1p6/6p1/p4pqp/8/1QP2P2/1P2R1P1/1K6 w - -',Compared to this when I am a pawn up but now the initiative has passed to White.
926,39,31,Qd8,b'1krq4/1p3Q2/6p1/p4p1p/8/2P2P2/1P2R1P1/1K6 w - -',He threatened to come in with his rook to e7. Now I can meet Re7 with Qb6 and both b2 and g6 are protected. He can't of course take on g6 immediately as I have a Queen fork on d1 winning. Computer agrees with me that this is the best move for me and doesn't like Qb3-f7 and says Qb3-b5 is better. It thinks Black is slightly better.
927,39,32,Qb6,b'1kr5/1p3Q2/1q4p1/p4p1p/8/2P2P2/1PK1R1P1/8 w - -',Computer prefers 33. Re7 anyway. Computer likes Qb6 and thinks Black is better.
928,39,33,Qc5,b'1kr5/1p2Q3/6p1/p1q2p1p/8/2P2P2/1PK1R1P1/8 w - -',As I am a pawn up it seemed sensible to try and exchange queens but computer prefers Ka7 and with the benefit of hindsight I agree.
929,39,34,Rc6,b'1k6/1p6/2r1Q1p1/p1q2p1p/8/2P2P2/1PK1R1P1/8 w - -',I am trying to make everything safe and engineer a favourable exchange of queens. Computer agrees with this move.
930,39,35,Ka7,b'8/kp6/2r3p1/p1q1Qp1p/8/2P2P2/1PK1R1P1/8 w - -',I didn't want an ending where my King is stuck on the back rank but I don't think it makes much difference.
931,39,36,Qxe5,b'8/kp6/2r3p1/p3qp1p/5P2/2P5/1PK1R1P1/8 w - -',I think he wanted to pin down my King side pawns a bit. I finally exchange. Computer prefers Qb6 but I think the exchange is better. Any views Dear Reader?
932,39,37,Ka6,b'8/1p6/k1r3p1/p3Rp1p/5P2/2P5/1PK3P1/8 w - -',so now everything is protected and my King is in the game
933,39,38,b5,b'8/8/k1r3p1/pp2Rp1p/5P2/2P3P1/1PK5/8 w - b6',So as well as mobilising the King Side pawns maybe in some variations I may be able to engineer a passed a pawn? This may be on the cards if he plays b3 or b4.
934,39,39,b4,b'8/8/k1r3p1/p3Rp1p/1p3P2/1PP3P1/2K5/8 w - -',Now I should have just calmly played 40....Rd6 or Kb6 but I tried to force matters with a little combination which didn't really work out.
935,39,40,a4,b'8/8/k1r3p1/4Rp1p/ppP2P2/1P4P1/2K5/8 w - -',I could have chickened out with Rd6 but I wanted to be consistent.
936,39,41,axb3+,b'8/8/k1r3p1/1R3p1p/1pP2P2/1p4P1/2K5/8 w - -',Computer actually prefers a3 I would be interested in your views!
937,39,42,Re6,b'8/8/k3r1p1/1R3p1p/1pP2P2/1K4P1/8/8 w - -',So this is the plan to go after his King side pawns.
938,39,43,Re3,b'8/8/k5p1/1R3p1p/1KP2P2/4r1P1/8/8 w - -',White can actually save the pawn with 45. Ra5+ and 46. Ra3 but after Re4 it is hard for him to make any progress. He decides on anothe plan.
939,39,44,Rxg3,b'8/8/k5p1/1RK2p1p/2P2P2/6r1/8/8 w - -',According to plan.
940,39,45,Rg4,b'1R6/8/k5p1/2K2p1p/2P2Pr1/8/8/8 w - -',Going after the other pawn
941,39,46,Ka7,b'1R6/k7/2K3p1/5p1p/2P2Pr1/8/8/8 w - -',of course he threatened mate!
942,39,47,Ka8,b'k7/1R6/2K3p1/5p1p/2P2Pr1/8/8/8 w - -',No more checks!
943,39,48,Rg1,b'k7/1R6/1K4p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/6r1 w - -',Threatening Rb1+ winning
944,39,49,Rb1+,b'k7/6R1/1K4p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/1r6 w - -',He has nasty mate threats
945,39,50,Ra1,b'k7/6R1/2K3p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/r7 w - -',I indirectly protect the g6 pawn. If 52. Rxg6?? Ra6+ wins.
946,39,51,Ka7,b'6R1/k7/2K3p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/r7 w - -',Forced!
947,39,52,Kb8,b'1k6/6R1/2K3p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/r7 w - -',i didn't want to go to a6 as then he can take the pawn on g6 safely
948,39,53,Rb1+,b'1k6/6R1/1K4p1/5p1p/2P2P2/8/8/1r6 w - -',and a draw finally agreed. By the time I got home my dear lady was asleep! Thanks for looking at my annotation. Please leave comments and don't forget to rate my annotation. Many thanks!
