1,0,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The oh so popular Lopez.
2,0,2,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This seemed solid enough. Perhaps Nc3 was another option. I also considered Qe2 but to move the queen so early seems suspicious.
3,0,3,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I thought Bc5 would have been a better response but this looks fine as well. I know the DSB on e7 can defend the king well by going to f8.
4,0,4,Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I was afraid of d5.
5,0,5,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BNP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Preparing Be3 and stoping Ng4 and Bg4.
6,0,6,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/1BNPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - c6',Black's probably better here. He has space and initiative. 
7,0,7,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/nppNp3/4P3/1B1PBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I thought for a while before making this move. If Nxd5 I think I'm fine because I recapture then go c4 next turn.
8,0,8,1Nxb3,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/1ppNp3/4P3/1n1PBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Not sure about this move. He gets the bishop pair but I get a more active rook.
9,0,9,1Nxe7+,b'r1bq1rk1/4Nppp/p2p1n2/1pp1p3/4P3/1n1PBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',It's important I take first as to not mess up my pawn structure in the middle. After seeing what happened in the game I believe taking the knight is better here. The DSB for black is very passive right now.
10,0,10,d5,b'r1b2rk1/4qppp/p4n2/1pppp3/4P3/1P1PBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A good move opening the center when I can't defend comfortably. 
11,0,11,1Re1,b'r1b2rk1/4qppp/p7/1ppnp3/8/1P1PBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Here my big problem is that I lack a plan and am not sure how to improve my position. Mose pawn breaks are going to leave me with severe weakness's. Perhaps d4 could have been tried here and in all the lines I shouldn't lose a pawn due to the placement of blacks queen. I came up with a similar concept here soon. I'm struggling to hang on.
12,0,12,1d4,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2ppp/p7/1ppnp3/3P4/1P3N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Only now do I spot the tactic.
13,0,13,1Ng5,b'r3r1k1/1bq2ppp/p7/1pPn2N1/4p3/1P5P/1PPB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Maybe Nd4 was an alternative?
14,0,14,Re8,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/p7/1p6/8/1P2qN1P/1PP3P1/R2Q3K w - -',material is still even and maybe I can draw if I keep pieces on since black does have some queenside weakness's but here I should be completely lost after my next move.
15,0,15,2Qe1,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/p7/1p6/8/1P2qN1P/1PP3P1/R3Q2K b - -',This should lose as I don't see a refutation to this endgame.
16,0,16,2c3,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p3p2/1P2b3/2P4P/1P4P1/4N2K b - -',It was here I realized I'm too tied down and am in serious trouble.
17,0,17,3b3,b'8/6pp/p7/1p1k1p2/1P2b3/1PP4P/5KP1/4N3 b - -',To stop Kc4 though Now black can win with Bb1 Ba2 And Bxc3. My opponent did not see this plan.
18,0,18,3Kd2,b'8/8/p6p/1p1k1pp1/1P2b3/1PP4P/3K2P1/4N3 b - -',Perhaps g3 would have been a better move though if black sees the tactic I mentioned earlier it doesn't work now.
19,0,19,3Nf3,b'8/8/p6p/1p1k2p1/1P2bp2/1PP2N1P/3K2P1/8 b - -',If Bxf3 I should have a fortress with winning chances to boot.
20,0,20,3Nd3,b'8/8/p6p/1p3bp1/1P2kp2/1PPN3P/3K2P1/8 b - -',This idea looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. Idea is to go to c5 while I can and fight for what now is an unclear game.
21,0,21,3Nc5+,b'8/8/p6p/1pN2bp1/1P2k3/1PP2p1P/3K2P1/8 b - -',Nc5+ to gain a temp on the king.
22,0,22,4c4,b'8/8/N6p/1p4p1/1PP5/1P3k1b/3K4/8 b - -',The race begins!!
23,0,23,4cxb5,b'8/8/N6p/1P6/1P4p1/1P3k1b/3K4/8 b - -',This looks ugly but I liked lines in this more than just pushing as black can stop me in time.
24,0,24,h4,b'8/8/1P6/1PN5/6pp/1P6/3K1kb1/8 w - -',Things may look grim but I had some ideas in mind.
25,0,25,5c7,b'8/2P5/1P6/8/7p/1P6/3K2p1/5k2 b - -',I was low on time here as was my opponent. I believe pushing the B pawn would have been a better choice so it cannot simply be captured once black promotes.
26,0,26,5Qxh4,b'8/8/1q6/8/7Q/1PK5/4k3/8 b - -',I'm not to knowledgable with endgames so I don't know if this is a win or not. If I had to guess it's probably a draw but I played on since I am a pawn up.
27,0,27,6b4,b'8/8/8/8/KP1q4/Q7/4k3/8 b - -',My idea. I want to try and push this pawn while blocking checks.
28,0,28,6Qc3,b'8/8/5q2/8/1P6/2Q5/1K2k3/8 b - -',No more checks!
29,0,29,Kc6,b'8/8/1qk5/8/1P6/1K6/4Q3/8 w - -',Sneaky! Forcing queens off here would make a draw!
30,0,30,7Qc4#,b'8/8/1q6/1k6/1PQ5/1K6/8/8 b - -',A rough game. Clearly there's room for both my opponent and I to improve.
31,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Beans and I discussed annotating this one after it was over and now she's being lazy about doing it so here we are. 
32,1,1,g4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P1P1P1/8/PP1P1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',This opening doesn't make a ton of sense to me currently but she did a pretty good job through a lot of this game. I still feel like d3 Nf3 or Nc3 would all be better moves than this one.
33,1,2,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2P1P1P1/8/PP1P1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Looking to fiancetto of course. Not sure what I was thinking at the time but I don't see a problem with it yet.
34,1,3,g5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/4p1P1/2P1P3/3P4/PP3P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Poor development here. That pawn isn't leading to any advantage that I can see and now she's given up tempo to black by moving it twice.
35,1,4,c5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnpbp/2n3p1/2P1p1P1/4P3/3P4/PP3P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Moving a second pawn twice. Six moves in and only four pawns have been moved. Develop the minor pieces!

40,1,9,1Rc2,b'r2qr1k1/1p3p1p/p2p2p1/3P2P1/5Bb1/P2P4/1bR1B2P/3QK2R b K -',Black wins another pawn shortly with Qa5+ with the choice of either a3 or d5.

42,1,11,Qxd3,b'r3r1k1/1pR2p1p/p2p2p1/3P2P1/6b1/3q4/1b1BB2P/3QK2R w K -',Moving to make good on all the threats to e2.

44,1,13,2Bxd3,b'r5k1/1pR2p1p/p2p2p1/3P2P1/6b1/3B4/1b5P/4K2R b K -',I see nothing wrong with white's play here. Black should have Qxd1 first and come away with Bxd1 followed by Rxd3+. I messed up again and now have very little in the way of material advantage and white has the slightly stronger position.
45,1,14,Re3,b'6k1/1pR2p1p/p2p2p1/3P2P1/3b4/3BrbR1/7P/5K2 w - -',All solid moves through there...

48,1,17,2Kxe3,b'6k1/1pR2p1p/p2p2p1/3b2P1/8/3BK3/7P/8 b - -',Black has managed to blunder his way into a bad position and a material deficit. Great job.
49,1,18,Ke8,b'4k3/1pR2p1p/p2p2p1/3b2P1/7P/3BK3/8/8 w - -',White just needs to clear out some space and protect those pawns. 
50,1,19,3Rxb7,b'4k3/1R3p1p/p2p2p1/6P1/3K3P/3B4/8/7b b - -',Fatal mistake. This is the one bad move that undoes all the previous good ones.
51,1,20,Kxc6,b'8/5p1p/2k3p1/p2p2P1/K6P/8/8/8 w - -',This game is now effectively over. White played a good game through to move 30 and just made a bad move. Throughout though Beans did a good job of capitalizing on my mistakes and protecting her territory.

376,12,45,2exd5,b'r3r1k1/1b3p1p/pq3np1/2bPN1Q1/8/1B1P2NP/RPP2PP1/5RK1 b - -',and he accepts my play

378,12,47,2d6,b'3rr1k1/1b3p1p/pq1P1np1/2b1N1Q1/8/1B1P2NP/RPP2PP1/5RK1 b - -',ouch! man -3 and finding myself in this position. i guess i wasnt playing the proper moves at all and the score was showing it. i didnt like this situation 
379,12,48,2Rxe5,b'3r2k1/1b3p1p/pq1P1np1/2b1r1Q1/8/1B1P2NP/RPP2PP1/5RK1 w - -',i judged the knight was the most effective piece in that attack combined with that d pawn  also in my current skill level and gameplay experience. my Bishop play is far better than my rook play is. so i decide to give him 1 of my rooks. keep conserving my bishop pair and also get that scary d pawn out of here. 
380,12,49,Rxd6,b'6k1/1b3p1p/pq1r1np1/2b1Q3/8/1B1P2NP/RPP2PP1/5RK1 w - -',and so i find there to be alot Less stress around my king now but im at a -4 score sheesh.  but im looking at this wide open board and my bishop pair. maybe momentum will be on my side cause of his sleeping rooks
381,12,50,2Raa1,b'6k1/1b3p1p/pq1r1np1/2b1Q3/8/1B1P2NP/1PP2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',hmm he tries to activate his rook.

388,12,57,3Rd7,b'6k1/1b1rQp1p/p4np1/8/3q4/1B1P2NP/1bP2PP1/1R3RK1 w - -',if he takes with bishop on f its Kg7 and he has a hanging LSB for a pawn not a great exchange as he would be forced to retreat or lose his queen and all surrounding pieces are protected from his queen to attack them

394,12,63,3a4,b'6k1/1b1r1p1p/5np1/8/p1Bq4/1RbP2NP/2P1QPP1/5RK1 w - -',and so i can keep climbing

399,12,68,3Qd2,b'6k1/3r1p1p/2b2np1/8/2Bq4/p2P2NP/RbPQ1PP1/5R1K b - -',finally wakes his knight up. 
400,12,69,3Bd5,b'6k1/3r1p1p/5np1/3b4/2Bq4/p2P2NP/RbPQ1PP1/5R1K w - -',i told myself i can maybe accept the LSB trade off at this stage and it would place my queen on d5 eyeing his rook
401,12,70,3Ne2,b'6k1/3r1p1p/5np1/3b4/2Bq4/p2P3P/RbPQNPP1/5R1K b - -',seems my opponent didnt feel compelled to trade bishops first and attacks my queen first. this created a bother but then i saw a nice move that would let me keep my LSB and get his off the board
402,12,71,3Ne4,b'6k1/3r1p1p/6p1/3b4/2Bqn3/p2P3P/RbPQNPP1/5R1K w - -',alright i accept queen trades! but ill fork your rook and lose my knight to your LSB buddy!

419,12,88,5b5,b'6k1/5p1p/6p1/1P6/8/p4RKP/Rb2r1P1/8 b - -',and he did so much relief ! from -5 to +4 over the entire game!

431,14,0,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.  
432,14,1,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The first phase of the assault is initiated by White with 4. Ng5... White is poised to hone in on that f7 square -- twice attacked once defended.  So white ceases the moment to begin his attack on the king side.
433,14,2,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',So black defends in the center by cutting off the white bishops pathway to the f7 square.
434,14,3,Nxf7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2Npp/2n5/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White forks Blacks queen and rook and provokes Black to recapture. By moving his king Black forfeits his ability to castle so as to extinguish White's onslaught or at least have it contained.  In the opening play it is generally not a good idea to move the same piece twice.. thus white looses a tempo and exchanges knight for pawn and is now down in material.
435,14,4,Qf3+,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',White continues with his attack with 7. Qf3+ ...
436,14,5,Ke6,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1k3/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',...which forces Black's king closer into the center and becomes an important defender of his knight on d5. Here we have the Fagatello attack Leonhart variation.  
437,14,6,Nc3,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1k3/3np3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Here white mounts the pressure on Black's knight on d5 which is pinned on that square because of  white's bishop on c4.  Black is feeling alittle overwhelmed by the forced defense of his pieces.
438,14,7,Nd4,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/4k3/3np3/2Bn4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',What you'll see more often is 8...Nb4 a more defensive move than what Black plays: 8....Nd4 attacking the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2. By not reinforcing his other knight on d5 it becomes a sore square that White can immediatly cease with any three of his attacking peices.  Black's position is getting weaker with every forceful move he makes.  White is simply allowing Black to turn his own forward momentum against himself.
439,14,8,Bxd5+,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/4k3/3Bp3/3n4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"White takes with 9. Bxd5+.Black only has one piece developed on the board compared with White's three pieces actively in the game.  White's pawn structure is still solid and unscathed.  Black has a very weak e5 square that White can manipulate. There's just not enough hiding places for Black's king; he's abit stuck in the middle of the board being drawn further into White's territory.

440,14,9,Kd6,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/3k4/3Bp3/3n4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black doesn't have too many places to go without getting mated right away.  He is holding onto this position by fighting tooth and nail against White's attacks.

443,14,12,Nxe6,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kn3/4p3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now both light squared bishops are off the board.  Black must somehow regain his equalibrium and put an end to this downward spiral.
444,14,13,1Ne4+,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kn3/4p3/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Now the walls are coming down for Black; his position is crumbling.  After this check with 12. Ne4+ Black's king is forced to come closer into White's territory.
445,14,14,1Kd5,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/3kp3/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',With 12....Kd5 Black's king seems to be on his last leg. His king has moved all over the board which lost quite a bit of tempo.  Soon as the queens come off the board the tables turn on White when Black's king goes on to become a powerful attacking piece.  
446,14,15,1c4+,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/3kp3/2P1N3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ c3',White has no time to make a weak passive move.  He cannot let up on Black's king. White must  keep the attack going without taking time to stop and smell the roses. Black's king is steadily being pushed further away from his comfort zone.  White a bit up in material can afford to sacrifice his knight on e4. Leading to 13...Kxe4 14.Qxe6 Kd3 15.O-O Qd6
447,14,16,1Kxe4,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/4p3/2P1k3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Let's keep the attack going by limiting the mobility of Black's queen and subsequently the rest of his force. What can black do shy of resigning? A lack of certainty could be instant devastation the beginning of chaos and total lack of control.  Uncertainty is a form of fear which we must overcome.
448,14,17,1Qxe6,b'r2q1b1r/ppp3pp/4Q3/4p3/2P1k3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White's queen squares off with Black's king. White's queen controls the d5 and f5 squares preventing Black's king from retreating back into his own territory. Black's not going to last long after this. He can't hold this position together.
449,14,18,1Qd4,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/4Q3/4p3/2Pqk3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -', So now Black has walked himself into the corner with a mate in 3.  He still is an inch away from being checkmated.  15.Qg4+ Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and mate.
450,14,19,1Qg4+,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pqk1Q1/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Black is passed the point of no return and his king is doomed.  White is only helping Black by tightening his noose... unfortunatly it will back fire like the many times before and then before you know it he's tightening the noose around his own neck.  15...Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and checkmate.
451,14,20,1Kd3,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pq2Q1/3k4/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',The only square Black can move to.  
452,14,21,1Qe2+,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pq4/3k4/PP1PQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The next and last move for white is going to be checkmate.
453,14,22,1Kc2,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pq4/8/PPkPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black's only move.
454,14,23,1d3#,b'r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pq4/3P4/PPk1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',So there you have it.  There's several different variations you can explore on your own.  It's always good to be prepared for the tricks and traps of this opening so you will know exactly how to play this variation.
455,15,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I've always played at my best with e4. In serious play I've yet to deviate from this. His preferred opening with White was a variation normally seen in Queen's Gambit Declined where White plays d4 supports with e3 and then after playing c4 would push for c5 and immediately support with b4. I rarely encounter these games when Black and I found it a bit difficult to play accurately with my camp so cramped up from the Queenside. I would pull through from the opening frequently I'd even take an advantage for a good bit of time but I got blindsided enough for him to come back and win the overall game both times.
456,15,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',As Black he's an e5 player something I've seen far too often and always enjoy fighting against.
457,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I play this hoping he plays Nc6. Actually I think he even did our first match where I was able to launch into a Ruy Lopez but perhaps it was a different player as his next move this match was what I remembered as his most astonishing characteristic...
458,15,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',d6. So we have ourselves a fan of the Philidor's Defense. I openly herald this opening as a passive opening for Black as it immediately does White the favor of trapping the bishop on f8. It's rather easy I find as White to grab hold of the center almost right away and launch early attacks as Bb4 is not a problem to worry about most of the match. However he handles this defense well when in a Blitz match and I'll show you how this happens.
459,15,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Main line for White. Philidor himself when he invented this opening believes that the opening is best played for Black to now attempt f5 with a counter-threat on e4 and a nice diagonal on the light bishop. Opening theorists have ultimately decided that should White play carefully however none of these lines result in equal positions but rather an advantage for White as the color ultimately gets the first attack.
460,15,5,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But this is my opponent's twist on the opening. f6 blocking the knight. Black welcomes White to try to seize the light squares while Black tries to capitalize on his own patience and the dark squares.
461,15,6,Be3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Black normally exchanges the pawn on d4 but I know that there will be a bishop on g4 eventually and I'd rather my position be ready for the inevitable exchange about to head my way. Also Nbd2 is a much stronger move now a move we tried in one of our earlier games but didn't quite get to this time around.
462,15,7,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',This was new for him eyeing the f5 square and bringing some fight to d5 as well.
463,15,8,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/3Pp3/4P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White could exchange but with all of Black's developed pieces on dark squares the weakness on e6 is something that he will have to deal with for much of the match. With such a strong outpost Black must defend very carefully.
464,15,9,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/4P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays this a surprisingly strong pawn while never quite making the overall intention of the move clear. If White takes the pawn it's simply replaced by the b7 pawn or either knight could grab it as well. I'd rather keep the outposts my pawn offers me so...
465,15,10,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/2P1P3/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq c3',...I respond with this forfeiting whatever power a minor piece on b5 could grant me in exchange for my control of e6. White's plan here is immediately clear and obvious though.
466,15,11,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/2pPp3/2P1P3/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black's on the other hand was not. If Black played c5 at once then the outposting done against my dark bishop would have been much more obvious and the idea to then capture en passant could have been far more justified on my end. Even so with an extra pawn move spent Black sacrifices tempo for discrepancy forcing me to respond in a way that makes me question the tactical or strategic motivations behind his movements. The idea here still is not quite yet done either...
467,15,12,a4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/4BN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq a3',I don't want to give up my control of b5 so this was a plan to deter a6-b5 by Black. A preemptive move... possibly premature given what Black does next.
468,15,13,Qa5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/q1pPp3/P1P1P3/4BN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',So ultimately the move 5 ...c6 provokes White into playing c4 strengthening this check where I have to carefully consider where I want my pieces to go while he starts to exploit the dark squares he can pin on my queenside. Overall I still like my position here but the amount of counterplay Black has here is not to be taken lightly either.
469,15,14,Bd2,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/q1pPp3/P1P1P3/5N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I had a bit of a think here the choice of two developed or two non-developed pieces to pick to block the check. In the end I decided I wanted him to spend more time moving his queen than making other decent developing moves.
470,15,15,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/5N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Still the greatest solution to this move here would probably involve me moving my bishop again to c3 which I really didn't want to waste time by doing. Black's moves seem rather predictable for now but I'm not fully sure if I was playing the best way for White to have dealt with this line.
471,15,16,b3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/1P3N2/3B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Move the pawn move the Queen or move the Bishop. This move caused me the least amount of grief in my own mind though it does become a weakness as the Queen is its only defender.
472,15,17,Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3B1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',This move finally appears developing a virtually useless bishop given my pieces occupy mostly the light squares. Black hardly has much other use for it at this time.
473,15,18,1Be2,b'rn2kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3BBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I play this though I'm still not overly too sure about how I want my kingside to look once I've castled. I couldn't make up my mind between me wanting the knight on h4 or to just force the exchange by pushing h3. I was searching for the exact combination of moves but...
474,15,19,1Ng6,b'rn2kb1r/pp4pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3BBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',...this threw a wrench into my thinking. I see Black gaining power with a knight on f4 while stopping my own Nh4. I didn't want to sacrifice my dark bishop should Black play ...Nf4 either because I figured I had a better space advantage. Therefore my dark bishop was stronger than his light bishop which he was likely going to exchange in a moment.
475,15,20,1g3,b'rn2kb1r/pp4pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3NP1/3BBP1P/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',So I decide to weaken my light squares daring Black to play ...Bh3 while preventing the Knight from grabbing those dark squares. 
476,15,21,1Be7,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3NP1/3BBP1P/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Instead he develops enabling castling. Either he's fine with the position as is or he's waiting for more of an idea of what I'm planning. 
477,15,22,1Bd3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P1B1NP1/3B1P1P/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Looking back I think I told myself that e4 was potentially in danger of an f5 push and I wanted my pieces in place to defend such an idea after Black castles. A sound idea but perhaps too soon...
478,15,23,1Bxf3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/1P1B1bP1/3B1P1P/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black captures the knight something I knew was going to happen eventually and something I didn't mind having to retaliate using the queen.
479,15,24,1Qxf3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/1P1B1QP1/3B1P1P/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Which I do and this is practically forced.
480,15,25,1Qxb3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/3p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/1q1B1QP1/3B1P1P/RN2K2R w KQkq -',I did forget about how my Queen was busy defending two squares at once and the unfortunate placement of my light bishop costed me a pawn.
481,15,26,1Ra3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/3p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/Rq1B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N2K2R b Kkq -',But even though I'm down for material White has four very active pieces whereas Black really only has his queen and knight. Dropping that pawn wasn't going to be the end of the world because I was pretty sure I was ahead in development. I was working my way toward having about 7 and a half minutes at this point so I was pretty comfortable with where I was.
482,15,27,1Qb6,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/R2B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N2K2R w Kkq -',The queen must retreat again allowing me more tempo at the cost of my pawn.
483,15,28,1O-O,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/R2B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N3RK1 b kq -',I finally take the chance to castle. I still wasn't too sure how I wanted to attack yet.
484,15,29,1O-O,b'rn3rk1/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/R2B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N3RK1 w - -',Whereas Black has a very clear target in mind: f5. It's a bit bizarre because even though Philidor's defense isn't exactly among the list of Black's most successful defenses here my opponent found himself having a very clear reach of the key square the former GM prided himself in regard to this opening. I may be ahead in development but for me to use that development to form some sort of attack I needed an idea on how to clear the air on Black's side of the board. And right now that meant going on the defensive.
485,15,30,1a5,b'rn3rk1/pp2b1pp/1q1p1pn1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/R2B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N3RK1 b - -',Right here I decided that grabbing the extra pawn movement was probably going to help me out. It also prevents Black's a5 creating an outpost on b4 for a Queen or Rook to invade upon.
486,15,31,1Qd8,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2b1pp/3p1pn1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/R2B1QP1/3B1P1P/1N3RK1 w - -',This was probably best for Black. Qc7 has a lot of blockage before h2 is reached on my side but at least the Queen over here gives the bishop more power. However Black has now moved the Queen five times just to return her to her original position.
487,15,32,1Nc3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2b1pp/3p1pn1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/R1NB1QP1/3B1P1P/5RK1 b - -',I continue to develop still looking for a way to push ahead.
488,15,33,1Qd7,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb1pp/3p1pn1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/R1NB1QP1/3B1P1P/5RK1 w - -',Her sixth move but the threats along this diagonal are serious and need to be addressed at once.
489,15,34,1g4,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb1pp/3p1pn1/P1pPp3/2P1P1P1/R1NB1Q2/3B1P1P/5RK1 b - -',This move made me cringe a little putting the pawn directly in the path where the Black Queen could stare down my king. Even still my position to me looked rather safe for now because the pawn is secure with all my efforts to control f5 but the player treading dangerously is definitely White at this point.
490,15,35,1Nh4,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb1pp/3p1p2/P1pPp3/2P1P1Pn/R1NB1Q2/3B1P1P/5RK1 w - -',Black took a few moments before playing this move. I imagine he also was wondering where h5 would have brought him but decided against it. Interestingly enough looking at the line I'm quite worried about ...h5 gxh5 Nh4 Qg3 f5. The e4 pawn is immediately threatened and my Queen cannot defend f5 from h3 prior to that move because Black's Queen controlled that square. Nor can I take the knight because after f5 the bishop guards h4 so I'd now need to debate how to deal with the rook on f8 coming into combat. It's a bit unclear (perhaps Bg5 would help me trading off the bishops by then?) and while I think this move is okay I'm left wondering where that alternative line could have taken us.
491,15,36,1Qg3,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb1pp/3p1p2/P1pPp3/2P1P1Pn/R1NB2Q1/3B1P1P/5RK1 b - -',A few moves prior to this one I did tell myself that the queen would have been stronger on h3 attacking the knight while defending from f5 but at this point I just reacted after seeing the knight go here knowing the Queen would need to come off of f3. I was a bit upset at just blundering away some tempo like that.
492,15,37,1g5,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb2p/3p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1NB2Q1/3B1P1P/5RK1 w - g6',But here Black chooses to defend the knight and maybe with the added idea that my bishop can't reach h6 anymore? I'm not too sure if the only purpose of this move was to protect the knight or not.
493,15,38,2Qh3,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb2p/3p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1NB3Q/3B1P1P/5RK1 b - -',Either way I was happy to get the chance to place my queen on the correct square again. Now Black can't push his way into my camp once more.
494,15,39,2Na6,b'r4rk1/pp1qb2p/n2p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1NB3Q/3B1P1P/5RK1 w - -',I think he took some moments to think here as well. If I were Black I think I'd consider asserting control over the f-file even more by playing Rf7 stacking the rooks down the column before White can do so himself but I guess he decided he wanted to bring his queenside pieces into the game a bit more eyeing Nb4 to kick the bishop or even Nc7 to work the knight into the kingside via c7-e8-g7. I kinda feel like Black has a bit of an edge here now but he wasn't too sure how to begin chiseling away at my development yet either.
495,15,40,2Bb1,b'r4rk1/pp1qb2p/n2p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1N4Q/3B1P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',I can't let my bishop lose sights on e4-f5 so I retreat it while I can.
496,15,41,2b6,b'r4rk1/p2qb2p/np1p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1N4Q/3B1P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Next he plays this. I think he was hoping to bait me. If I capture then after axb6 axb6 his rook is protected but mine is exposed after he moves the knight somewhere else. I'm forced to either move it and lose more tempo or exchange and Black's other rook recaptures onto an open file. 
497,15,42,2Ne2,b'r4rk1/p2qb2p/np1p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R6Q/3BNP1P/1B3RK1 b - -',I'm not going to waste time and accelerate Black's attack. Instead I see that my knight can help drive into the fray via e2-g3-f5 potentially kicking the bishop or disrupting the King's defences on h6. Plus I need not worry about the bishop on b1 needing a defender as long as my other rook stays on the first rank.
498,15,43,2Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p2qb2p/np1p1p2/P1pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R6Q/3BNP1P/1B3RK1 w - -',I think here he decides that if I'm not going to capture that he might as well take advantage of bxa5 with a rook on the mostly open b file. However in doing so...
499,15,44,2axb6,b'1r3rk1/p2qb2p/nP1p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R6Q/3BNP1P/1B3RK1 b - -',...in moving the Rook the threats in capturing vanish completely. Without the rook on a8 the Knight doesn't allow any kind of discovered attack that could cause me too much discomfort.
500,15,45,2Rxb6,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R6Q/3BNP1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Meanwhile this is forced or else the knight on a6 is dropped.
501,15,46,2Ng3,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R5NQ/3B1P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',Black isn't threatening anything on the Queenside anymore so I resume my plan to put my knight on the outpost on f5.
502,15,47,2Rb2,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/n2p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R5NQ/1r1B1P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Black tries this his timer was thinning down to about 3:00 left on the clock at this point I believe. Still I think I find this move inferior as all it does is kick a bishop that isn't really doing anything. Better for Black could have been Rfb8 I think as it forces me to reconsider the place of the far more important b1 Bishop. This just wastes Black's time.
503,15,48,2Bc3,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/n2p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1B3NQ/1r3P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',Now the Rook must retreat. I did also have 25. Bxg5 equalizing material after ...fxg5 Rxa6. At the time I didn't see it but even if I did I'm not all that convinced that opening the f-file would be in my best interests. An alternative line I can see continuing this is ...Rb4 Bd3 Rb3 Rd1 Rb2 Nf5. But the thing is White's Knight is now stuck being a defensive though rather well guarded piece. But now my f2 pawn becomes horridly weak and even though it's not immediately clear to me how Black could have exploited this (perhaps by stacking the rooks?) I think I'm right in not wanting to give the Black rook pair a new possible way of entering the game and that the closing of the f-file is worth being down a pawn.
504,15,49,2Rb6,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPp1p1/2P1P1Pn/R1B3NQ/5P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Anyway I kicked the rook and it goes here. Forced or else the knight is dropped for nothing.
505,15,50,2Nf5,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPpNp1/2P1P1Pn/R1B4Q/5P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',Finally my plan completes and my Knight assumes a completely offensive position from this square. I have several options and I'm starting to like my position again. 
506,15,51,2Nxf5,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPpnp1/2P1P1P1/R1B4Q/5P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Black's knight on the other hand wasn't really doing anything on there anymore and decides to trade off his bad knight for my good knight. I'm not sure if this was necessarily a thing to have to beat me to doing- say Black plays Rfb8 now and White plays Nxh4 next comes gxh4 Qxh4 f5! Qh5 fxg4 and again I'm a pawn down only now the only blockage on the kingside is Black's protected g4 pawn and my Queen is stranded without much way of getting her the help she needs.
507,15,52,2exf5,b'5rk1/p2qb2p/nr1p1p2/2pPpPp1/2P3P1/R1B4Q/5P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',But now I dominate control over f5 and now Black's light squares around the King are dismal without virtually any chance of fighting out of this now. My g4 pawn also strengthens as a result no longer needing my queen confined to reach of it with the f5 pawn in the way. Having realized this I started seeing ways of being able to move my pieces around to start focusing on working my way around Black's structure to make my way toward the king. My real only weakness here is f2 and c4 but if I'm careful there are ways of bringing about a hopeful attack. Starting with the obvious- kicking my rook from a3 to h3 somehow.
508,15,53,2Bd8,b'3b1rk1/p2q3p/nr1p1p2/2pPpPp1/2P3P1/R1B4Q/5P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',My opponent began rapidly realizing he needed a new way to crash through my defenses but at too much a cost to his clock. Hanging steadily around 2 minutes left he begins maneuvering this bishop and while it's not immediately clear his intentions I was relieved by the passivity of this move. It was a sign that he needed to give me breathing room for once.
509,15,54,2Qg3,b'3b1rk1/p2q3p/nr1p1p2/2pPpPp1/2P3P1/R1B3Q1/5P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',I remember being a bit unhappy about this being the second time the Queen came here but regardless the Queen needs to move off so that the h pawn can move forward.
510,15,55,2Nb4,b'3b1rk1/p2q3p/1r1p1p2/2pPpPp1/1nP3P1/R1B3Q1/5P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',Meanwhile Black moves the knight here either hoping I'd exchange hoping that there's a place for his pawn or the rook or he's waiting to see what I'm up to next.
511,15,56,2h4,b'3b1rk1/p2q3p/1r1p1p2/2pPpPp1/1nP3PP/R1B3Q1/5P2/1B3RK1 b - h3',Meanwhile the h pawn comes out. My Queen can now take h2 controlling the h file while being able to spearhead an attack after a rook joins her on h3. My clock here is about 9:30 right now. Time looked rather well for me it was certainly on my side but the battle to pierce through against Black is still far from over.
512,15,57,2Rf7,b'3b2k1/p2q1r1p/1r1p1p2/2pPpPp1/1nP3PP/R1B3Q1/5P2/1B3RK1 w - -',My opponent had about 2:15 when he started here. Once he finally came up with this move his clock fell down to about 0:40. He really needed to think about what other ground Black could advance upon to prevent White from coming in and right now I could tell he was really grasping at the best way to maintain his defenses while winning the overall game. Here it looked like he was trying to figure out how to counterthreat me if I took the pawn on g5. Black's Queen could come around on b7 and help the Rook on b6 while the other Rook could find a home on g7 reaching g4 and wholly guarding h7. Black's defenses are rather solid- unfortunately his clock was certainly against him more than anything else!
513,15,58,3Qh2,b'3b2k1/p2q1r1p/1r1p1p2/2pPpPp1/1nP3PP/R1B5/5P1Q/1B3RK1 b - -',I don't think my Queen has any business being on the 3rd rank anymore so I move her where a Rook can come in front of her. I'm not in any hurry to resolve the pawn situation just yet.
514,15,59,3gxh4,b'3b2k1/p2q1r1p/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/1nP3Pp/R1B5/5P1Q/1B3RK1 w - -',But Black is. He eagerly grabs the pawn and wonders what I'm going to do about it.
515,15,60,3Bd2,b'3b2k1/p2q1r1p/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/1nP3Pp/R7/3B1P1Q/1B3RK1 b - -',The bishop had to move off so that the Rook could come over to h3 but from there what to do about the bishops? Originally my thought was to pair them between a1-b1 but I noticed that this would be potentially dangerous due to b1 being weak if Black were to stack rooks down the b file. So I move the bishop here a new diagonal where it could move a bit more easily but more importantly- a diagonal that could strike h6.
516,15,61,3Rg7,b'3b2k1/p2q2rp/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/1nP3Pp/R7/3B1P1Q/1B3RK1 w - -',Meanwhile Black hits the pawn here forcing me to defend g4 once again.
517,15,62,3Qxh4,b'3b2k1/p2q2rp/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/1nP3PQ/R7/3B1P2/1B3RK1 b - -',So I'm forced to capture the pawn I was happy to ignore. I'm desperately grasping at how to go about getting my rook to h3 without my Queen having to be in front of it wasting moves just to protect the g4 pawn.
518,15,63,3Na6,b'3b2k1/p2q2rp/nr1p1p2/2pPpP2/2P3PQ/R7/3B1P2/1B3RK1 w - -',The knight retreats. I'm worrying at first because I see Nc7-Ne8 again but with the strong Black Rook occupying g7 I'm not entirely sure how hazardous this piece was actually going to be.
519,15,64,3Be4,b'3b2k1/p2q2rp/nr1p1p2/2pPpP2/2P1B1PQ/R7/3B1P2/5RK1 b - -',Meanwhile I don't want to tie my other rook down on the back rank so I move my other bishop to here removing any chance of pushing e4 by Black and defending b1 directly.
520,15,65,3Nb8,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/2P1B1PQ/R7/3B1P2/5RK1 w - -',The knight continues its journey and I anxiously watch what Black is trying to get out of it.
521,15,66,3Re1,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/1r1p1p2/2pPpP2/2P1B1PQ/R7/3B1P2/4R1K1 b - -',I continue trying to move my other Rook somewhere it can help in the game. Kg2-Rh1 doesn't work because the g4 pawn is still pinned to the king and my Queen still leads the charge.
522,15,67,3Rb2,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/2P1B1PQ/R7/1r1B1P2/4R1K1 w - -',Meanwhile Black kicks the bishop again for no real reason.
523,15,68,3Bc1,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/2P1B1PQ/R7/1r3P2/2B1R1K1 b - -',I move the bishop here. I guess I told myself I wasn't too concerned if Black tried making a makeshift pin with Rb1 at the time but looking at this again I can see how such a move would have caused me grief even if I were to try a move like f3 right afterwards.
524,15,69,3Rb4,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/1rP1B1PQ/R7/5P2/2B1R1K1 w - -',Eyeing the c4 pawn.
525,15,70,3Ree3,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/1rP1B1PQ/R3R3/5P2/2B3K1 b - -',But I'm shortsighted and I completely miss the other rook move. Whoops. In hindsight this blunder actually drove me to lose a lot of my other pieces and to a pin so I really wish I saw the other rook move when I had the chance to.
526,15,71,3Rxc4,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/2r1B1PQ/R3R3/5P2/2B3K1 w - -',So I drop another pawn again and the Bishop on c1 comes under fire anyway.
527,15,72,3Rac3,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/2r1B1PQ/2R1R3/5P2/2B3K1 b - -',I defend but at least my rooks are coordinated this time.
528,15,73,3Rxe4,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/4r1PQ/2R1R3/5P2/2B3K1 w - -',Or they were. Black is able to exploit the pin on g4 now even at the cost of his rook.
529,15,74,3Rxe4,b'1n1b2k1/p2q2rp/3p1p2/2pPpP2/4R1PQ/2R5/5P2/2B3K1 b - -',Practically forced.
530,15,75,3Qxf5,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pPpq2/4R1PQ/2R5/5P2/2B3K1 w - -',White can't capture the Queen the Rook is threatened to move h5 is viable and my pawn structure is falling apart. My next choices are going to be difficult ones. Black meanwhile has been able to take advantage of these mistakes. His clock has improved to about 2:00 now and mine here was about 6:30 and falling.
531,15,76,3f3,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pPpq2/4R1PQ/2R2P2/8/2B3K1 b - -',After quite a bit of time I finally decide to give up the Rook-Queen team on the h file.
532,15,77,3Ba5,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPpq2/4R1PQ/2R2P2/8/2B3K1 w - -',He hits the rook hoping I entirely forget which piece it's guarding.
533,15,78,4Rc2,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPpq2/4R1PQ/5P2/2R5/2B3K1 b - -',Which I unfortunately do. The f3 pawn is left hanging and my position is only worsening under my hasty command by the second.
534,15,79,4Qxf3,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPp3/4R1PQ/5q2/2R5/2B3K1 w - -',So the Queen eagerly grabs the pawn and my rook is attacked once again.
535,15,80,4Rcc4,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPp3/2R1R1PQ/5q2/8/2B3K1 b - -',I can't move the other rook or else I'll lose g4 to Black with check.
536,15,81,4Qd1+,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPp3/2R1R1PQ/8/8/2Bq2K1 w - -',Throwing in a check hoping I miscalculate my movements a bit more.
537,15,82,4Kh2,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pPp3/2R1R1PQ/8/7K/2Bq4 b - -',I break the pin and if Black takes I have the opportunity to reverse back onto the Black King should Black play a bit carelessly. I'm not seeing any better alternative lines for White here.
538,15,83,4Bd8,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pPp3/2R1R1PQ/8/7K/2Bq4 w - -',Black retreats the bishop preventing Qxf6.
539,15,84,4Re1,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pPp3/2R3PQ/8/7K/2BqR3 b - -',Meanwhile I thought Black had a discovered check with ...f5 threatening capturing the rook while hitting the Queen with the bishop. So I move the Rook down to here hitting the queen. Naturally because it's Blitz I completely overlooked the fact that if Black had done this Queen takes Bishop is check and the Bishop had no defenders. Gosh do I ever hate Blitz sometimes :D
540,15,85,4Qxd5,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pqp3/2R3PQ/8/7K/2B1R3 w - -',My four back pieces might be stronger than Black's but I am down FIVE PAWNS against him. I have almost half the number of his pieces and my situation is growing more increasingly desperate.
541,15,86,4Rc3,b'1n1b2k1/p5rp/3p1p2/2pqp3/6PQ/2R5/7K/2B1R3 b - -',I move my rook here wanting to to find another way to coordinate my pieces but I completely overlooked Black's next... and rather obvious... next move.
542,15,87,4Ba5,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1p2/b1pqp3/6PQ/2R5/7K/2B1R3 w - -',Horrid. No other word for this. Two skewered rooks and neither piece is really defensible by this. Just horrid. I had to take three minutes to see any kind of hopeful counter-attack because I knew that any decision I make after this next one was only going to be difficult choices from here.
543,15,88,4Qxf6,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1Q2/b1pqp3/6P1/2R5/7K/2B1R3 b - -',It was a tough choice but I decide to try to counter-threat the only reason the Bishop was sitting on d8 in the first place. I brace to lose a major piece but Black has a different idea in mind.
544,15,89,4Qa2+,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1Q2/b1p1p3/6P1/2R5/q6K/2B1R3 w - -',I suppose like when I hesitated in taking back the pawn Black wanted to use this edge on the board to start moving his pieces toward my king because even with the rather staggering advantage there was a gap he still had to close.
545,15,90,4Kh3,b'1n4k1/p5rp/3p1Q2/b1p1p3/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B1R3 b - -',I'm still bracing to lose that Rook on c3 at this point.
546,15,91,4Nc6,b'6k1/p5rp/2np1Q2/b1p1p3/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B1R3 w - -',Instead he plays this a staggering blunder. Again to be fair he has a rather short clock to deal with. I've taken probably most of my excess time down to about 3 minutes at this point and he was alive only due to the bonus 15 seconds per move. But in playing this move to close the gap on my king he allowed me just about the only chance I was going to get to counter-attack on the Black King to go all out on one final stand to rescue myself from this game.
547,15,92,4Rf1,b'6k1/p5rp/2np1Q2/b1p1p3/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B2R2 b - -',Bh6 Rf3 Rf1. Between all three of them I felt this one gave me the greatest chances of escaping the most positions resulting in check. With Rf3 I was worried that a rook capture would be check and with Bh6 I wasn't too entirely confident that the resulting checks after ...Rf7 Qg5+ Kh8 with the bishop on h6 would rescue me from the Queen and Bishop screaming down my King and Rooks. Looking at the Bh6 line now it looks a little more promising but I didn't have much time to entertain what would be my final big think for my only chance to turn the game around. 
548,15,93,4Rf7,b'6k1/p4r1p/2np1Q2/b1p1p3/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B2R2 w - -',Anyway his clock declined to under a minute again and sees he's forced to move the rook here.
549,15,94,4Qg5+,b'6k1/p4r1p/2np4/b1p1p1Q1/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B2R2 b - -',The queen steps off again with check.
550,15,95,4Rg7,b'6k1/p5rp/2np4/b1p1p1Q1/6P1/2R4K/q7/2B2R2 w - -',And the Rook blocks and I see that Black's King is extremely confined to the corner now... which was fantastic but my queen is on such a terrible diagonal that trying to fix her position basically means I lose the momentum to attack! 
551,15,96,4Rcf3,b'6k1/p5rp/2np4/b1p1p1Q1/6P1/5R1K/q7/2B2R2 b - -',So after another 30 seconds to think over my counterplay I decide to put all my eggs into one basket in one final push toward the king... even if it means losing the queen!
552,15,97,4Rxg5,b'6k1/p6p/2np4/b1p1p1r1/6P1/5R1K/q7/2B2R2 w - -',Even though I knew it was temporary seeing (-11) on that scoreboard was also cringe-inducing for me to have to look at while this game wore on.
553,15,98,5Rf3f8+,b'5Rk1/p6p/2np4/b1p1p1r1/6P1/7K/q7/2B2R2 b - -',Finally some gleaming hope that a Queen sacrifice could save me...!
554,15,99,5Kg7,b'5R2/p5kp/2np4/b1p1p1r1/6P1/7K/q7/2B2R2 w - -',Forced.
555,15,100,5Bxg5,b'5R2/p5kp/2np4/b1p1p1B1/6P1/7K/q7/5R2 b - -',So I win back some material for my Queen but my accuracy must be spot on at this point.
556,15,101,5Qb3+,b'5R2/p5kp/2np4/b1p1p1B1/6P1/1q5K/8/5R2 w - -',Black tries to exploit the position further but his queen cannot lose control of f7.
557,15,102,5Rf1f3,b'5R2/p5kp/2np4/b1p1p1B1/6P1/1q3R1K/8/8 b - -',I'm still able to force the Queen to move to a square where she either can't check the King very easily or where she can no longer defend the Black King from a rook on f7.
558,15,103,5Qc4,b'5R2/p5kp/2np4/b1p1p1B1/2q3P1/5R1K/8/8 w - -',So he plays this. Probably the better idea but Qd5 would have been stronger (if I blunder by moving the wrong Rook Black has a mating attack with Qh1).
559,15,104,5Rf8f6,b'8/p5kp/2np1R2/b1p1p1B1/2q3P1/5R1K/8/8 b - -',But I'm not falling for that! I move here confining the Black King still and allowing my bishop to help with the attack. I was pretty sure that this was mating by this point.
560,15,105,5Bd8,b'3b4/p5kp/2np1R2/2p1p1B1/2q3P1/5R1K/8/8 w - -',The Bishop comes here. I liked ...Ne7 a bit more than this.
561,15,106,5Bh6+,b'3b4/p5kp/2np1R1B/2p1p3/2q3P1/5R1K/8/8 b - -',The bishop invades and Black is finished.

563,15,108,5Rf6f8+,b'3b1R1k/p6p/2np3B/2p1p3/2q3P1/5R1K/8/8 b - -',Even though the move is strong enough to lead to a mate anyway.
564,15,109,5Qg8,b'3b1Rqk/p6p/2np3B/2p1p3/6P1/5R1K/8/8 w - -',Forced but White must fight off the urge to capture...!!!
565,15,110,5Rf3f7,b'3b1Rqk/p4R1p/2np3B/2p1p3/6P1/7K/8/8 b - -',The final move that traps the King and the Queen can't capture either Rook either.
566,15,111,5Be7,b'5Rqk/p3bR1p/2np3B/2p1p3/6P1/7K/8/8 w - -',Alternative line: ...Bf6 Rxg8+ Kxg8 Rf8#.
567,15,112,5Bg7#,b'5Rqk/p3bRBp/2np4/2p1p3/6P1/7K/8/8 b - -',And here it is a smothered Mate with White being down the equal of two minor pieces! I really barely managed to pull the win out of this one and I was sure I was had after that skewer on c3 and e1. This truly was a fight to the bitter end a game I should not have won after some of the mistakes I had made. It was an interesting set of games none the less and it should remind all players that no matter how down you are in material the chance to come back and save the game could appear at any moment! I had made a great friend for blitzing at least and I had loads of fun with these games. Thanks for reading this annotation!

But this one is with a new ""irregular"" move the game didnt last long but i want to save the early lines as facing rare replies are good to keep note of in my mind. you face those less often and may have less natural memory to them"
588,17,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',and so my lovely nimzo! ive grown accustomed to it by now.  against players over 1800 rating it can fall short but its helped me climb from 1300 to the 1500 range with a good win ratio.  im also learning the budapest counter for d4 starters. and might start looking at the sicilian for higher opponents who go e4
589,17,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',my favorite gambit can only be played when white replies with nf3.  alot of whites will reply with d4 here and there are 2 ways to respond either e5 or d5 i personally choose d5 vs d4 reply ive learnt those lines alot more
590,17,3,f5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5p2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',and the gambit starts here. its called the colorado gambit.  initially played by a  player called Doug Root i believe  he was able to win many games until grand masters were able to analyse flaws in this start but sub 1800 rating this gambit is extremely fun to play.
591,17,4,exf5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',and so he decides to accept my gambit

593,17,6,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1P2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',this is the first time i face this situation. where a white does not take out his LSB before playing his d pawn. much less i never anticipated him to block his LSB in... hmm uncharted waters. ill develop naturaly for a move or 2 still and see if what develops
594,17,7,Bxf5,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',recapture + development
595,17,8,Bf4,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/5B2/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',hmmm not nc3 nor Bg5. this is really unexpected. i have to think to myself. is this opponent familiar with the opening im using or is he also just going with the flow having not faced the colorado gambit before.
596,17,9,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p4/5Bb1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',usually i wouldve been able to play e5 but since he has double coverage on that square i couldnt play that yet. so i decide to pin his knight to induce a pawn weakness or allow e5 depending on his reply.
597,17,10,Be2,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p4/5Bb1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',reinforces the knight. very wise choice or else i couldve played nd4 threatning a double pawn  here i took a long time to what my reply should be. and playing e5 is no longer viable. i dont want to move any left side or right side pawns to have both castle options open. playing nf6 is developing but doesnt help the situation on e5 and creates alot more tension because he could now play his knight on e5 blocking my pawn and moving my queen now doesnt seem wise with 3 of his pieces live with blind attacks.
598,17,11,d4,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',so im happy i faced an irregular game like this where an opponent didnt develop his d pawn at all and playing d4 is a wise crunch. so i choose to replay this move that was great. i also remembered that trying to fight for the e5 square in that fight wouldve led to my demise. but i can set a trap up with the e5 square.  and it was wiser to castle long during that game. so now i can also move my king side pawns
599,17,12,Nbd2,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',the d4 prevents nc3 obviously. he also cant take the pawn with his knight. i can hold back my epawn until i consolidate some material off the board and relieve some tension. so i analysed that the f knight and the DSB are the culprits that have to leave the board.
600,17,13,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',so i decide to help provide cover to the bishop incase he does choose to play ne5 and it further helps develop
601,17,14,Nb3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/8/3p1Bb1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',hmm going after my d4 pawn. i cannot let that happen. time to take attack the culprits i want to take off the board
602,17,15,Nh5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/7n/3p1Bb1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',if he takes my d4 pawn he loses his bishop. i would hope to induce a pawn reinforcement. or that he would go to d2
603,17,16,Be5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/4B2n/3p2b1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',hmmm unanticpated reply. and has now triple attack on my d4 pawn. but he placed both the 2 units i wanted off the board within attacks reach
604,17,17,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/4B2n/3p4/1N1P1b2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',and so force the bishop retake first and itll be an even trade but i get both the 2 enemies of the e5 square off the board
605,17,18,Nxe5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/8/4n2n/3p4/1N1P1B2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',gulp and gulp
606,17,19,1Bxh5+,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/8/4n2B/3p4/1N1P4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',and since im queen side castling. pinning my knight isnt wise even though i do want the e5 square open.  playing the pawn is safer
607,17,20,1f4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1p2p/6p1/4n2B/3p1P2/1N1P4/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq f3',hmmm un anticipated reply.  taking the bishop isnt wise as he gets a pawn up in the exchange and a queen check on h5 with a pawn on e5.  so i decide that both of us conserving material is wiser. i played the pawn anyway to kick the bishop away.  his attack on my knight is sorta a time gainer for me to move out of the e5 square. and sets up my trap
608,17,21,1Nf7,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pn1p/6p1/7B/3p1P2/1N1P4/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',and so now i play here to cover the e5 square possibly play nh6 if he decides to push his pawn should i try to attack it with g5.  
609,17,22,1Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pn1p/6p1/8/3p1PB1/1N1P4/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',my opponent temporarily blocks my long castle. i analysed many courses and then saw a nice trap. where e5 if he is the attacker of that square again can really hurt him. like in my last game. if i played in a way to not have a focus there but a time gain when he would attack it could be deadly.
610,17,23,1fxe5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2n1p/6p1/4P3/3p2B1/1N1P4/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',hmm he takes shouldnt off i can retake now with my knight but i dont want that lsb to move
611,17,24,1Bb4+,b'r2qk2r/ppp2n1p/6p1/4P3/1b1p2B1/1N1P4/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',check! if he promotes pawn its a pawn down exchange with a possible danger to his rook and a high chance of losing his castle. so knight defence looks wiser
612,17,25,Bxd2+,b'r2qk2r/ppp2n1p/6p1/4P3/3p2B1/3P4/PPPb2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',but taking the knight forces a loss of castle or a displacement of the queen. 
613,17,26,1Qxd2,b'r2qk2r/ppp2n1p/6p1/4P3/3p2B1/3P4/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',my opponent chose to save his castle
614,17,27,1Qh4+,b'r3k2r/ppp2n1p/6p1/4P3/3p2Bq/3P4/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq -',"losing exchange. im sad my opponent resigned at this stage. bishop pawn down would be hard to play with a pawn on d4 i take it.  he was playing very aggressively.  im happy i annotate these types of games. it served me well to not panic in new situations

all comments appreciated  if he my opponent choose to retake with king. i recapture pawn with knight gain time on the lsb and possibly get the chance to finally castle long. i may be forced to advance the king side pawns first. but i think black has a nice board set up with an open view to the king"

630,19,7,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp3/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',so i pin the knight to possibly invite a6 then play Ba4 to invite b5 and weaken the queen side pawn structure incase he wanted to queen side castle or i may also decide to double pawn him if the board looks good for it also this seems more time efficient than going straight to b3.
631,19,8,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/3pPP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',he decides to do an advance

675,20,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',To continue development as it is a central pawn needed for development.  I also emphasize that concepts to my students and Reuben mentioned it in his last annotation.  In addition I played this to prevent her pawn from advancing which she won't do right away since that's pushing it as opposed to developing.  But at some point she'll likely consider doing so.  Although it's no where near a passer I treat pawns that continue advancing as though they are passed pawns since they can also become dangerous.

Doing that would allow it to become dangerous which is in that case.  I know because I've lost a couple of games one against Jack and another on this website which was also a terrible game because I allowed N's to come in and therefore they became dangerous.  This gave my opponents an immediate winning advantage.

But if I gave this a little more thought I would've forced an exchange with 5...Bxc3  This was well before cplusplus11 copied and pasted an article from a GM forgot what the name is on if N's worth more then B or B worth more.  Not to mention that I still had trouble determining an open from a closed position.  Plus Jack told me that a N is usually worth more.  However I was on another website and recently at the time read an article that in the mid game a N is worth more since they have what I mentioned earlier.  The power to fork when they come in.  In the end game however a B is worth more because they can fork say K and a piece.  And they can become quite dangerous.  Also worth noting is that at this point I am starting to get distracting because Gerhard and I were making up with one another regarding the Chicoboy's Legacy Club.  I was upset and had a rough week that I'm already starting to lose concentration.  However this is not the worst as we'll see shortly.

Maybe it was to connect her R's after castling but I would not have brought out my Q quite yet.  Jack said that even after development is completed and you have castled you should still wait to bring the Q out until you absolutely must since the Queen is fragile and can still be harrassed nontheless.  In fact I lost a game against because I brought out my Q just when I thought it was safe to do so as I had not only castled but just completed development.  But my coach said that it was still a little too early to bring it out.

If I gave this anymore thought I would've played 11...Qxf6! as opposed to this.  Taking with the Q would've given me the advantage since I am now strengthen the Q side structure I guess you can say.  In fact while definitely I think I would've had the winning advantage for that reason.  But this is an outright blunder because as Jack has mentioned it exposes my K as I now have doubled pawns around the K as he also said is the worst place to have doubled pawns.  That's why I deem this move worthy of the double question mark.  At this point I have completely lost concentration.  It does however start to gradually come back soon but the damage has been done.

Therefore I still remained distracted which caused this blunder because of her next move.  If that distraction had already tapered off I would've retreated with 15...Ne7  From here on in the distraction lessons more but it is too little too late as she has now compensated and with my K exposure has a near winning advantage at this point.

Note: Some time ago I made this mistake against Jack when he threatened something similar and I miscalculated but the situation was even worse because instead of a pawn he was able to win a piece.  It was my LSB if I'm not mistaken.

It should lose the R I thought that my Q was in danger and had to defend either that or the R since the fork was effective.  But had I payed better attention I would've realized that this isn't so as I could've compensated and won her N with 24...Bxd5  Note: I was not completely back to my normal self during this game.

I played this because I got too confident that I had won something back.  But in this context because of what she is about to do.  In fact it loses very quickly.  Taking with the B is also a blunder as I'd lose the Q so ""To take is a mistake."""
716,20,43,2dxe6+,b'1r6/3k1p2/1r1qP2p/pp6/7Q/b4N2/4RPPP/5RK1 b - -',This is how.  She just compensated and either way I fall behind.  In this position she has a passed pawn so I have to be careful.

717,20,44,2fxe6,b'1r6/3k4/1r1qp2p/pp6/7Q/b4N2/4RPPP/5RK1 w - -',But there isn't because after getting confident that as I stopped the promotion she will still win my Q by pinning it with her next move.
718,20,45,Qxd2,b'1r6/3k4/1r2p2p/pp6/7Q/b4N2/3q1PPP/5RK1 w - -',There however were not a lot of options as she was also threatening 21.Ne5+ and after getting out she would still my Q for R.  Except that it gets worse as I saw a potential mating sequence.  Now I see that she wouldn't have mated but the result of what happened would've remained the same.
719,20,46,Rc6,b'1r6/3k4/2r1p2p/pp6/7Q/b7/3N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',? Trying to compensate as the plan was 32...Rc2  But I could've done better with 31...Rd6  Note: Now that I am in a lost position I will do just about anything for counter play.  That means even if unsound get really aggressive as long as I have enough defenders because this is now the alternative to resigning.  And for me resignation is not an option yet.  However I did not do a good enough as something else needed to be defended.  As a result this loses another pawn.  Best was 31...e5 defending the h6 pawn.  
720,20,47,Rbc8,b'2r5/3k4/2r1p2Q/pp6/8/b7/3N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',?? Doubles up and putting pressure on the c file.  With the idea of getting aggressive as noted earlier I also looked at and considered 32...e5  However this move and 32...e5?? are both blunders as they would result in the same thing the loss of yet another piece.  I'm not sure but I believe that the best move was 32...Be7 so even after what she plays my B is still safe.
721,20,48,b4,b'2r1k3/8/2r1p3/p7/1p6/Q7/3N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',? Now I do what I can for counterplay.  And seeing that I have passed pawn I push it since passed pawns must be pushed.  However this was a miscalculation as I now lose another pawn.  Best was either 35...Ra6 or 35...Ra8   
722,20,49,Rc6c1,b'2r1k3/8/4p3/Q7/1p6/8/3N1PPP/2r2RK1 w - -',Now I recently gave constructive criticism to reachforgoals for doing something like this and in general a bad idea.  the only difference is that in this position I know that it isn't mate.  But the idea was pinning the N and threatening mate.  This is my only alternative to resigning at this point because even if I defend the b pawn the position is hopeless because despite the passed pawn with a non passer on e6 and two R's she is far ahead.  Not only that but has one more passer then me so it is on or another lost.  But I am determined not to resign yet.  That however will change very shortly.
723,20,50,3Nf1,b'4k3/8/4p3/Q7/1p6/8/5PPP/2r2NK1 b - -',"Seeing how it is and for the reasons outlined I resign.  After this game all the negatives in this context went away.  In other words I did not let it distract me after this game.  What I learned is that right after getting over a bad experience in general it needs to become history right away.  Or as the saying goes which should happen right away is ""Let by-gons be by-gons"".  In other words you shouldn't let things go eventually.  Sure things will be settled but you won't play as well.  Instead it's better to let it go and start thinking about the positives immediately and have things calm down immediately.  That way it won't distract in your games."

my idea is to capture his pawn at f4 calling check same time attacking his knight or rook. if he captures my bishop with his knight. i can call check and win his rook. or if captures my bishop with his rook i can call check and capture his knight.

1160,34,12,2Bxb7,b'4n1k1/pB4p1/7p/8/8/4P1P1/PP3P1P/6K1 b - -',White is winning here.  There are pawn majorities on both sides of the board.  The e-pawn is now a passed pawn.  And with pawns on both sides the B should be superior to the N due to its speed.
1161,34,13,3Kf1,b'5k2/p5p1/3n3p/3B4/8/4P1P1/PP3P1P/5K2 b - -',Ideally one would keep K and B on opposite-colored squares to avoid the possibility of a fork.  Barring that pay attention!

1165,34,17,Nb8,b'1n6/4k3/7p/p3PPp1/2BK2P1/1P6/P6P/8 w - -',Since b5 is available for White's B moving to b8 gives White's B the opportunity to dominate the N by covering all of its available squares.

That seems presumptuous to me and I don't know who died and put the computer in charge of things.
1169,35,1,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/2p5/3bP3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',So far Reuben is doing fine. The computer marks this down on a mistake on black's part. Bc5 is the computer's preference. Anyone care to take a guess why? I'm guessing it's got something to do with cutting off the diagonal for the bishop but this is a gap in my knowledge.
1170,35,2,Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/2p5/3NP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',c3 is the preferred move because black's bishop is cut off from retreat by the previous move to c5 forcing a bad trade in the form of Bxf2. Trading the knight was unnecessary and only helps black instead of strengthening white's position.
1171,35,3,Qxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/2p5/3qP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I guess a central and unthreatened Queen is a pretty good thing.

But yeah Reuben missed a great opportunity to capture both material and position here and this is probably the move that cost him the most.

1175,35,7,2Qxa7,b'2r2rk1/Q4ppp/6q1/1pP5/8/2Pn4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Even though this move picks up material it puts white's Queen out of the action.
1176,35,8,2Rfe8,b'2r1r1k1/Q4ppp/6q1/1pP5/8/2Pn4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black takes advantage of the empty file and also solidifies his claim on e1. The end is near.
1177,35,9,2Qa5,b'2r1r1k1/5ppp/6q1/QpP5/8/2Pn4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Further removing the Queen from the action. Where's the benefit here? Even the threat of Qxb5 is immediately defeated if black responds with Rxc5. Black is able to effectively ignore the Queen for the rest of the game now and takes ownership of e1 as previously staked out.

I rather keep on  attacking d6 which will make Wd5 a strong pawn (and also we have to consider that d8 is a black square and can therefore be dominated by WB)
1216,36,34,3gxf6,b'6k1/1p5p/n2B1P2/2pP1p2/2P4P/1P3P2/3K4/8 b - -',Yes  maybe I should have advanced the king but this seemd to be ok as well. The rest of the game is just about playing with the extra times white has because of his gained pawns even when I did not played well there moving the bishop instead of bringing the king forward.
1217,36,35,3Kf4,b'1n6/4Bk1p/1p3P2/2pP1p2/2P2K1P/1P3P2/8/8 b - -',f5 cannot be defended since 38...Ng6 follows 39.h5+ and then pawn in f6 will crown.

1223,37,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So we start off with a standard game.  Note: we do play one last game but I will not annotate it since it was with Random Fischer Control so the position ironically is different.  But the former member like's a lot of openings.  One thing he was known to do was give a lesson with a few QPO's games.  I think that one of them leads to the Owen's defense.  But he will not play that however since he wants me to stick to basics.  Even though he does not tell you directly it's implied as we'll see with his next move.
1224,37,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Now that said Owen's Defense would've been a little different but I bet that had I played it I might disagree.  That's because against a stronger player as WB also emphasized sticking with the basics is better as noted earlier.  So this is my response.
1225,37,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The QG of course.  Now like I said in isaiah11's annotations I have better luck declining the gambit which I am going to do.
1226,37,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard.
1227,37,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Also standard.
1228,37,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Normally it would make sense behind this move for development.  But in reality I don't know why he played only because he and cplusplus11 told me in a previous annotation that in the QP's games one should not develop the C N.  However I also know that not every single needs or should be followed because they contradict one another and cause confusion.  It's about development controlling the center and K safety.  So last Friday I spoke to Jack Stockel on if I should 4.Nc3 with that unfamilar principle and told him about it.  He said that it is not a bad move and that playing that is a good idea for the same reason I thought.  Ironically I won that game later on. 
1229,37,6,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile because I am not used to that website I do different things.  First development but I waste no time in putting pressure against the N.  Since I have spoken to about this by previous commentators I wouldn't have played this but as noted where this game was played involves the only website where I am not a serious.  Consequently I don't play anymore on that site.
1230,37,7,Ne5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3pN3/2PP2b1/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',At first I wasn't sure why he played this and viewed it as pointless.  However for the reasons outlined earlier I didn't even look at or consider threats made by opponent which in general is a big mistake.
1231,37,8,g6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3pN3/2PP2b1/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',My goal is two things.  First development since I fianchetto to get my DSB into play.  And since my e pawn has not moved yet it does not waste time.  Second it's to exchange because I stick to this after what Jack taught me but when you are up against a stronger player and things are even it's better to exchange early and often.  Now when GAC was here he said that my assessment was right in a PM.  In fact in the message he told me that the reason I almost lasted 40 moves against him in our last game on this website was the fact that I exchanged early and often.  Even better is the fact that I don't end up with doubled pawns after the exchange.
1232,37,9,e4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2PPP1n1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',At first I only thought that his goal was to develop.  But this is where I start to go wrong and my concentration is quickly fading away.  If I had looked more carefully I would've seen that my N is en-prise through a discover attack.  Note: I am also trying to accommodate him as well since he wants me to move quicker.  Now unlike a lot of people I never felt like he was trying to rush because of the way he said which wasn't something like hurry up or else.  But just asked if I could keep moving and I didn't mind.  In part because when I rushed on GK as a mentor told me I was occasionally moving even quicker then I did in my games against him.  That changed when I was told to slow down and give more concentration.  But I was not going to do so on the website that we were playing in part because you could not drag the pieces like you can here.
1233,37,10,dxe4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/8/2PPp1n1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?? This is the first blunder.  Now if had I seen the threat I would've responded with 7...Nf6 but in this case I got greedy as I figured that I had won a pawn.
1234,37,11,Bg7,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2PPp1Q1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Now I decide to go back to development.
1235,37,12,Qxe4,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2PPQ3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',This leads to an interesting exchange.  And since it's pawns as opposed to pieces it's of no real asset to liquidate.  At first however I thought I had lost a pawn.
1236,37,13,Bxd4,b'rn1qk2r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/8/2PbQ3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',But I found the significance of this move as my Q protects the B.

Instead I would've played 11.Bd3 with idea of castling short on the next move so 12.0-0  So there has to be a reason why castling long is better then castling short.  But I don't know what the reason is.  However it's still worth annotating because it is important to try and figure out why as that is part of theory.

Once again a miscalculation as I thought that I had won something back and therefore did not have to liquidate.  But what I overlooked was his R on d1.  And with it I now lose my Q.  Normally I would resign after his next move but I felt it'd be better to wait especially against perhaps the best player in the world.  That's because the longer you hang around the more you learn.  GAC agreed as he implied while on GK before getting booted that while we were playing I was making the right choice by not resigning.  Instead it was better to let him mate me.  The idea is the same as to why you don't resign in the Supplemental Talking the Talk game. 
1245,37,22,b6,b'r3r1k1/p2Rpp1p/1pp3p1/2P3B1/8/2N5/PP3PPP/2K2B1R w - -',? So getting more desperate I do what I can to stay in and at the very slightest chance which is in reality 0 is to get counterplay.

1247,37,24,1Bc4,b'r3r1k1/p2RBp1p/2p3p1/2p5/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/2K4R b - -',Developing his final piece.  However it's more then just that as he is threatening mate.  I know because this is very similar to a double bishop mate where it's just both bishops and K against the K.  So I have to be very careful.  I will only one make more attempt before all is said and done.  In other words resignation is soon to come.
1248,37,25,1h5,b'r3r1k1/p2RBp2/2p3p1/2p4p/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/2K4R w - h6',The idea is more then just a set of pawn chains.  Should he check I can get out with say 19.Kh7  There is a mistake here however as that would lose a R.  But I am trying to prepare for the worst.
1249,37,26,1Bf6,b'r3r1k1/p2R1p2/2p2Bp1/2p4p/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/2K4R b - -',"Until he plays this.  I now know that mate is soon to come with no way out of.  It might not be around but he is going to mate sooner or later.  In addition he wants to get started right away on our last game against each other involving the Random Fischer Controls.  So we both agreed that I would resign at this point.  Now normally I would not have taken the time to annotate a game like this but first it's a background history between geniusacamel and me which is another reason that I was so patient with him.  Second I pm'd archduke_piccolo over what a good job he was doing.  I also told him that since I am done with GAC I was for a while looking for a replacement to help me improve the way geniusacamel did.  Now ION is ideal because the way he teaches is very similar to the way that GAC taught the game and he is very friendly with opposite personality as GAC.  For example I studied a lot of ION's variations in a recent annotation and doing that enabled me to create a chess puzzle as of last night.  Not to mention that he is and was my first friend on this website who's helped me improve and is also a reason that I coach and mentor.  Plus he gave me some good advice to annotate more games.  At the time GAC gave the same advice by asking me to annotate his games.  Finally as GAC once called it this is ""public education"".  The idea being is that I'm up against presumably the world's best player.  That's why he did not lose a single game until the boot.  So it involves a lot of theory.  And as noted from previous annotations knowing a lot of theory is a good way to learn develop and become a better player."

1258,38,8,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/4N3/3PPpp1/2N5/PPPKBqPP/R1BQ3R b kq -',White adds another piece to the fray.
1259,38,9,Bb4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1p1p/5n2/4N3/1b1PPpp1/2N5/PPPKBqPP/R1BQ3R w kq -',I develop with a pin.

1270,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I kick off the game with a standard e4.
1271,39,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My opponent plays the Caro-Kann which is a relatively safe opening for black. Black prepares a d5 push in order to contest my e4 pawn.
1272,39,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The usual move here is 2.d4 but I had some other plans in mind. I wanted to throw him a little off game. The main downside of this move is that it opens the g1-a7 diagonal which could prove troublesome.
1273,39,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black follows his plans and strikes at the center.
1274,39,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',!? Yes I'm leaving my e pawn ripe for the taking while also allowing my opponent to poke check my knight. However White can either recover that lost pawn or get a huge attack.
1275,39,5,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black obliges and chases my knight away.
1276,39,6,Ng5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I move my knight into safety and I attack the pawn.
1277,39,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays the most natural move which develops a piece and protects his advanced e pawn. 4...f5 is dubious because of 5.Bc4 (attacking f7) Nh6 6.Nxh7!? Rxh7 7.Qh5+ Kd7 8.Qg6.
1278,39,8,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',! This is not exactly what I'd call subtle but the attack on f7 has to be dealt with. Or does it?
1279,39,9,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Well much to my dismay my opponent went for the safe route. The risky but still playable other option was 5...Bg4!? 6.Qxg4! Nxg4 7.Bxf7+ Kd7 8.Be6+ Kc7 9.Bxg4 and the position is very unclear.
1280,39,10,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B1pP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I hit Black's advanced e pawn once more. It is attacked twice and defended once.

1283,39,13,Bb6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black tucks his bishop into safety while keeping an eye on that pesky diagonal.
1284,39,14,d3,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I free my bishop while reinforcing my advanced pieces.
1285,39,15,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black castles.
1286,39,16,Qe2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I move my queen out of the back rank allowing me to eventually castle queeside. This also give me the option to play 10.Be3 to exchange bishops.
1287,39,17,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Good move. It would be very troublesome if the e file was to open...
1288,39,18,1Rf1,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KR2 b Q -',I plan to play 11.f5 after black tries to open the middle with 10...e5. Even if he doesn't my rook could jump to f3 into g3 or h3.
1289,39,19,1Nd5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1p3/3n4/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q -',Black puts his knight on a strong square. It cannot be taken due to the discovered attack/pin on the e file.
1290,39,20,1Bd2,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1p3/3n4/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPPBQ1PP/R3KR2 b Q -',I develop my bishop so that I may castle next turn. 
1291,39,21,1Bd4,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BbNP2/2NP4/PPPBQ1PP/R3KR2 w Q -',! Very good move. This bishop is hard to disloge even though I have quite a few pieces around!

1294,39,24,1Qh5,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1n3Q/2BbNP2/2NP4/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 b - -',!? I decide to go for the offense here; Taking my bishop now would result in 14.Nxd5 cxd5 15.Ng5 with a strong attack. This move also removes my queen from the dreaded e file. However I missed...
1295,39,25,1g6,b'rnbqr1k1/p4p1p/2p1p1p1/1p1n3Q/2BbNP2/2NP4/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 w - -',I had planned to play 14.Qh6 followed by Ng5 in this case but then I saw that Black could hold very well by playing 14...Bg7 hitting my queen and therefore winning my c4 bishop.
1296,39,26,1Qh3,b'rnbqr1k1/p4p1p/2p1p1p1/1p1n4/2BbNP2/2NP3Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 b - -',The best option. I keep the pressure on the h file. However I have to be very wary of that light-square bishop...
1297,39,27,1Bg7,b'rnbqr1k1/p4pbp/2p1p1p1/1p1n4/2B1NP2/2NP3Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 w - -',! Black plays it safely and slows my attack a lot while keeping his pressure on my queenside. However that means I can now save my bishop. 14...e5 would have been interesting but dangerous after 15.f5 because it cuts the d4 bishop from his king and my d2 bishop would have gained access to his king!
1298,39,28,1Bb3,b'rnbqr1k1/p4pbp/2p1p1p1/1p1n4/4NP2/1BNP3Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 b - -',I still can't take the knight due to the discovered attack by the bishop on my queen if I do so.

Also I should have done this move 1 turn sooner if I'd were to do it! It didn't really matter in this case but still...
1301,39,31,1exd5,b'rnbqr1k1/5pbp/2p3p1/pp1p4/4NP2/2NP3Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 w - -',Black obliges and attack both my queen and knight.

1303,39,33,1dxe4,b'rnbqr1k1/5pbp/2p3p1/pp3P2/4p3/2NP3Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 w - -',Obviously.
1304,39,34,1dxe4,b'rnbqr1k1/5pbp/2p3p1/pp3P2/4P3/2N4Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 b - -',I retake with my pawn which protects my f5 pawn and opens up the d file in which my rook is aligned with my opponent's queen. 18.Nxe4 is also worth consideration.
1305,39,35,1Qf6,b'rnb1r1k1/5pbp/2p2qp1/pp3P2/4P3/2N4Q/PPPB2PP/2KR1R2 w - -',Black moves his queen away from the d file and forms a battery aiming at my b2 pawn which soft-pins my c3 knight.

1309,39,39,2Qh6,b'rnb1r1k1/5pbp/2p4q/pp3PpQ/4P1P1/2N5/PPPB3P/2KR1R2 w - -',Black decides to go for the queen trade anyway. I was hoping for 20...h6? 21.Na4! (Threatening 22.Bc3!) b4 (21...bxa4?? 22.Bc3 and Black's defences crumble) 22.h4
1310,39,40,2Bxg5,b'rnb1r1k1/5pbp/2p4q/pp3PBQ/4P1P1/2N5/PPP4P/2KR1R2 b - -',Obviously.

1313,39,43,2h6,b'rnb1r1k1/5pb1/2p4p/pp3PBP/4P3/2N5/PPP4P/2KR1R2 w - -',! This is rather annoying as my bishop will get in the way of my other pieces or get attacked once my e pawn eventually falls to the rook.
1314,39,44,2Be7,b'rnb1r1k1/4Bpb1/2p4p/pp3P1P/4P3/2N5/PPP4P/2KR1R2 b - -',!? My bishop can more or less be taken due to 24.Rd8+ forking the king and the c8 bishop and Black's knight would get pinned to his other rook. Black could do 23...Bxf5 first which would lead to a very similar position but without a white pawn on e4. Right now I'm threatening 24.f6 which would really cramp Black's position!
1315,39,45,2f6,b'rnb1r1k1/4B1b1/2p2p1p/pp3P1P/4P3/2N5/PPP4P/2KR1R2 w - -',However black sees this and gets to f6 before I can.

1319,39,49,2Bxf6,b'rnb1r3/4Bk2/2p2b1p/pp3P1P/8/2N5/PPP4P/2KR1R2 w - -',Black obliges.

1322,39,52,2Rd6+,b'rnb1r3/8/2pR1k1p/pp3P1P/8/2N5/PPP4P/2K2R2 b - -',I force the black king to fall back so that my passed f pawn can move forward.

1326,39,56,2Rg1,b'rnb1r3/5k2/2pR1P1p/pp5P/8/2N5/PPP4P/2K3R1 b - -',Since my f pawn is protected by my d6 rook now I can relieve my f rook from its duty of protecting the pawn so that it can come crashing in g7. 29...Rg8 is bad due to 30.Rxg8 Kxg8 31.Rd8+.
1327,39,57,2Be6,b'rn2r3/5k2/2pRbP1p/pp5P/8/2N5/PPP4P/2K3R1 w - -',At this point my opponent gave me a draw offer which I accepted after a few minutes of analysis. I was happy enough to fight back that much after blundering a piece against a stronger opponent and I doubt I could have won this game at that point anyway. A possible continuation could be 30.Ne4 Bd5! 31.Rg7+ Kf8 32.Nc5 Bf7 and whatever. Ratings and comments are welcome.
