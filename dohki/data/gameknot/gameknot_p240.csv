0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Starting out with 1.d4 wich happens to be my favorite opening move too.
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I wanted to go for the Nimzowich defence with 3...Bb4
2,0,2,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But I must have telepathically send this to my opponent....White immediately eliminates the possibility of a pinned knight on c3.
3,0,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"Going for the center with the idea of playing c5 soon.
Maybe 3...b6 is also good and then fianchettoing the bishop to b7."
4,0,4,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Not the most ambitious move. White has played 4 pawn moves and has yet to develop a piece but he's in no hurry black has no serious advantage.. 
5,0,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Just developing and trying to go for quiet positional play.
6,0,6,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Attacking the white center. Maybe castling first is better. That's what most Game DB suggest.
7,0,7,dxc5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The strongest move. Now the d-file is opened up to the white queen and the capture cxd5 is coming somewhat weakening the black center. After the recapture ....exd5 black has an isolated pawn on d5. Still the position is about equal with correct play.
8,0,8,Bxc5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I considered castling first but I didn't like the thought of 7.b4 though again Black is still ok after 7...a5 with 8...b6 etc.
9,0,9,b4,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/1PP5/P1N1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq b3',I didn't expect this move but something like 7.cxd5 or 7.Nf3. Then again both moves are still possible since I have to move my Bishop again. Here I thought quite some time about 7...Bd6. After 8.cxd5 exd5 white cannot take the d5 pawn of course 9.Nxd5?? Nxd5 10.Qxd5 Bxb4  and the white Queen is lost. But I discarded the idea knowing my opponent would never fall for such a cheap trick.
10,0,10,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P1N1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',3 out of the 4 last moves with the Bishop but somehow its compensated by the fact that White is behind in piece development. 
11,0,11,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White must also have sensed this so instead of capturing on d5 he wisely developed his knight. 
12,0,12,dxc4,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Ok..an important moment in the game. It shows how occupied I was with the whole d5 issue. 8...O-O 9.cxd5 Nxd5 10.Nxd5 exd5 gives white a pleasant position. But my 'solution' to the problem unfortunately isn't good enough. 9. Qxd8  Bxd8 10. Bxc4 O-O is also good for white; The poor black Bishop must move again and it's white who is better developed.
13,0,13,Bxc4,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Luckily my 80-year old opponent decided to develop first.
14,0,14,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',"But now I missed the best continuation. 9...Qxd1  10.Nxd1 O-O with equal play. In the words of Danish GM Bent Larsen: ""If black equalizes then he's already better.""
"
15,0,15,1O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now white is better developed and his pieces are active.

19,0,19,1Be2,b'rnb2rk1/2q1bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/PQN1PN2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Defending the knight on f3.
20,0,20,1Rac1,b'rn3rk1/1bq1bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/PQN1PN2/1B2BPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',As expected..
21,0,21,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/1P6/PQN1PN2/1B2BPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',With this move I can complete development and avoid a discovered attack on my Queen.
22,0,22,1Rfd1,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/1P6/PQN1PN2/1B2BPPP/2RR2K1 b - -',White wants to control the open d-file.

29,0,29,Qxf6,b'2r3k1/1b3ppp/p1n1pq2/1p6/1P6/P3PN2/2Q2PPP/2RB2K1 w - -',The position is still totally equal.

31,0,31,2Ne5,b'2r3k1/1b3ppp/p3pq2/1p2n3/1P6/P3PN2/5PPP/1QRB2K1 w - -',Now it's Black's turn with the idea of a possible capture on f3 but I played it too soon. If 22....Nxf3  23.Bxf3 Rxc1  24.Qxc1 black cannot capture with 24...Bxf3 because of mate on the 8th rank. So instead 21...h6 would have been a logical continuation instead of the text move.
32,0,32,2Rxc8+,b'2R3k1/1b3ppp/p3pq2/1p2n3/1P6/P3PN2/5PPP/1Q1B2K1 b - -',The best move again.
33,0,33,2Bxc8,b'2b3k1/5ppp/p3pq2/1p2n3/1P6/P3PN2/5PPP/1Q1B2K1 w - -',The Bishop has to leave its good b7 square and for a second I feared something like  23.Qc2 Bb7 24.Qc7 with mate threat. But black can allways defend with 23...Nc4 or 23...Nxf3  24.Bxf3 Qa1 .

Yet another draw result from the 1st board brought the score to 3 - 1.5. But then the unthinkable happened. All the remaining players from my Team started losing their game one by one though each of them having good positions (pressure?). So unfortunately in the end my team lost the match with 3 - 5. 
Howeverthis was our only loss in the competition and after seven rounds my team became Champion!

Hope you enjoyed greetings from Holland."

102,1,62,5Nb4,b'8/8/6n1/5bBk/1N3P2/8/5K2/8 b - -',he then moved his Knight right over there
103,1,63,5Kg4,b'8/8/6n1/5bB1/1N3Pk1/8/5K2/8 w - -',I then decided to go for the Pawn
104,1,64,5Nd5,b'8/8/6n1/3N1bB1/5Pk1/8/5K2/8 b - -',which then his knight came back
105,1,65,5Nxf4,b'8/8/8/3N1bB1/5nk1/8/5K2/8 w - -',I took to make it harder for him to mate me with a Knight and a Bishop
106,1,66,5Bxf4,b'8/8/8/3N1b2/5Bk1/8/5K2/8 b - -',He then took and offered a draw and I accepted and hadn't he offered the draw I would of done next Be4 which then he would either lost the Bishop or the Knight and would of been a draw
107,2,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I started off with the English opening
108,2,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I then moved the Knight to prevent E4
109,2,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1bP5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He then brought out the Bishop to attack the Knight
110,2,3,Ne4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1bP1N3/8/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So I blocked the pawn instead

112,2,5,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP1N3/8/PPQPPPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',So I protected it with the Queen
113,2,6,Nxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1bP1n3/8/PPQPPPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',he then for some reason took it
114,2,7,Qxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1bP1Q3/8/PP1PPPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',A free Knight meaning it's not protected and quicker to type then exchanged

118,2,11,bxc5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/2P1p3/4Q3/P7/3PPPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I then took back
119,2,12,1e3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4Q3/P3P3/3P1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I moved pawn to E3 just in case of Qf6

131,3,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Game DB gave this move high marks.  Black should think twice before attacking the Bishop with d3 as it leaves e5 dangling in front of my Knight.
132,3,2,Be6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2ppb3/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black offers a trade.

140,3,10,Nxe5,b'r2qkbnr/p4ppp/2p1b3/3pN3/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I'd say we're roughly even now but I need to develop some power pieces.

145,3,15,1Qxd5,b'2r1kbnr/p4ppp/2N1b3/3Q4/3p4/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQk -',So I'll trade Queens...

150,3,20,1Nc3,b'2r1kbnr/p4ppp/8/8/3N4/2NP3b/PPP2P1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qk -',No his Bishop is no immediate threat and Rg3 should repel him when I desire so I think I'll develop my Knight.

158,3,28,1f3,b'2r1k2r/p4pR1/8/7p/1b1N2n1/2NP1P1b/PPPB3P/2KR4 b k -',Like so.

200,4,21,Rg5,b'r6k/6p1/p2P2qp/1p2p1r1/5p2/2P2R2/PP2N1Q1/R1B3K1 w - -',as I said earlier he's not wanting to drop a rook to a pawn...and he certainly doesn't want to lose his queen and have nothign to show for it.
201,4,22,2Ng3,b'r6k/6p1/p2P2qp/1p2p1r1/5p2/2P2RN1/PP4Q1/R1B3K1 b - -',the obvious move
202,4,23,2Rg4,b'r6k/6p1/p2P2qp/1p2p3/5pr1/2P2RN1/PP4Q1/R1B3K1 w - -',I did this move to keep pressure on the same position but more importantly to be able to pxg3 without having my rook take by his bishop on c1.  Which I would guess he was hoping that I overlooked.
203,4,24,2Qh3,b'r6k/6p1/p2P2qp/1p2p3/5pr1/2P2RNQ/PP6/R1B3K1 b - -',I'm assuming he did this to simply remove his queen from the G file held up by my rook.

205,4,26,3d7,b'r6k/3P2p1/p5qp/1p6/5p2/2P3pQ/PP6/R5K1 b - -',he continues with his pawn advancement which isn't a bad idea in most cases.

207,4,28,3Re1,b'3r3k/3P2p1/p5qp/1p6/5p2/2P3pQ/PP6/4R1K1 b - -',he makes the move I assumed.  It was here that I noticed my plot to end the game with a nice rook sac
208,4,29,3Kh1,b'3r3k/3P2p1/p5qp/1p6/8/2P2ppQ/PP6/4R2K b - -',He obviously moved his king to keep from the f2 fork with a pawn and/or a variety of other problems if he just moved the rook and allowed me to check him with the pawns...

Actually she did. She's quite safe here. This opening by white is known as the Paulsen Attack (although I'm not quite sure what Paulsen would be attacking from here). While it doesn't seem to exemplify white's best options in the opening it's far from a foregone conclusion.

It IS a foregone conclusion that patzers shouldn't pull their queens out early. Look on and you will see what  Paulson is attacking/what I am attacking. If this guy was a chessmaster than maybe he could pull his queen out early but he ain't one and he can't. I am trying to help people here.

White obviously wanted to attack the pawn at g7 a target typical of the Paulsen variation though for obvious reasons the attack is usually carried out from g3.

232,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Another loss to easy. Here I have a decent game up to my 17th move.  At that point I overestimate what the open lines will do for White and Black respectively. Followed by some other blunders after which White resigns on move 29. 
233,7,1,g3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/6P1/PPPN1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Designed to pressure the center.
234,7,2,Ne2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4pb2/8/3PN3/6P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It is not clear that taking the bishop offers white anything in this type of position. I hoped to transpose to some favorable Queens Gambit type position.
235,7,3,c5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/4p3/2p5/2PPB3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq c6',Black strikes back at the center.

237,7,5,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/8/2p1p3/2PP4/4B1P1/PP2NPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Surprising but forcing white to make a choice about the center.

244,7,12,1Ng4,b'r1b2rk1/pp2b1pp/1q6/2pP1P2/2P1pPn1/1P2B3/P3N1BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Ng4! Of course. Black does not need to worry about the f pawn.

249,7,17,Be5,b'5rk1/pp4pp/3q4/2pPb3/2P2PP1/1P2rB2/P1Q1N3/5RK1 w - -',25...Be5?!! An unexpected even shocking move. White should stay calm and even against a chessmaster make Black prove the sac is sound if for no other reason than otherwise White simply loses. But White is too frustrated with the rapid turn of events to remember this basic rule. After 26 PxB  QxP 27 Kg2 White may be able to draw.

You carry it out but your opponent crosses you with a surprise move sometimes one that will really put a spanner in the works or may cause you to lose at least a tempo to deal with the surprise move.  But you could have prevented that surprise move by taking preventative measures called Prophylaxis.  In this game shortly after getting out of the database I was planning to exchange heavy pieces on the open e file and end up with a perfectly reasonable and tenable game.  Alas!  Many a slip twixt cup and lip and here is how it all unfolds.  Here is where the prophylactic move a6 is certainly appropriate!  If I had played it I would have kept Freddy's knight out of b5 (the surprise move!).   That error was compounded by me failing to eject Freddy's knight out of d6 by playing Glenda back to c7.  Instead I played my bishop to c6 trying to screen out the c file first.  This wasted tempo proved fatal and I then lost my f pawn.  In this game I let Freddy walk all over me and got what I deserved - being Freddied (Jospeak for getting checkmated by Freddy)!  He starts off with 1. e3 which is Van Krujts Opening.

This prepares a sort of English Attack (Be3) with a Maroczy Bind.  The pawn on f3 allows White to develop his B to e3 without being attacked by Black's KN.

The direction of those operations will depend on where Black exposes weaknesses in his defences.  For example White could develop his B to e3 and Q to d2 castle queenside and launch the g-pawn at a castled king (the English Attack) or alternatively White may castle kingside and exploit the hole at b6 with Be3 and Na4.  The pawn on c4 encourages this approach.

As are a number of moves after this. I think I wasn't paying attention at this point in the match. This goes to show that you should not play chess when watching football. I think I lose a ton of momentum in thes next few moves.

553,18,17,1Bb2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2p5/b1Pp4/6n1/1P1P2P1/PBQNPP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Now the opportunity is gone for good.

This bishop was the more mobile of Black's pair (consider where the Black pawns are standing - the colour of the squares) and was worth a deal more than White's knight.  The exchange also cedes White the bishop pair - an asset easily overrated but an unnecessary concession all the same.  Better was 13...0-0 or 13...Nf6 to protect the g-pawn from capture.
555,18,19,1Qxd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2p5/2Pp4/6n1/1P1P2P1/PB1QPP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Of course it was too much to hope that White would retake with the king!
556,18,20,1Bg2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/2Pp4/6n1/1P1P2P1/PB1QPPBP/R3K2R b KQ -',A good moment to assess the overall situation since both sides are close to completing their development.  White is a pawn ahead.  That Black has nothing to show at least partially to offset this indicates White has the advantage.  Black will have to play hard to close the gap!

With this move Black makes it clear he isn't going to lie down even though his plan does have its risks.  Also possible were 15...Qe7 or 15...Re8 but it is by no means clear they are any better than the move played.
558,18,22,1Qc3,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pp5/2Pp4/6n1/1PQP2P1/PB2PPBP/R3K2R b KQ -',(!) Not just a transparent easily parried threat (17.Qxg7#).  White plans to make use of the c-file to bear down upon Black's backward c-pawn that will soon appear in the file.

560,18,24,Bb7,b'r2r2k1/pb3ppp/1qp2n2/3p4/8/1PQP2P1/PB2PPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',As good a place for the bishop as any.  Black has now a 'hanging pawn couple' (Nimzovitch) the backward pawn of which at c6 is under heavy attack.  Black has somehow to mobilise these pawns - a tall order!
561,18,25,2Ba1,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1qp2n2/3p4/8/1PQP2P1/P3PPBP/B1R1R1K1 b - -',(?!) An imaginative idea that says much about White's flexibility of thought together with fixity of purpose.  White wants to maintain the pressure on the long diagonal but to bring his rooks into the front line of the attack down the c-file.  But there is one small consideration that White has overlooked that had he seen it would have made him wait a move.  The right move was 21.b4! because...
562,18,26,2c5,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1q3n2/2pp4/8/1PQP2P1/P3PPBP/B1R1R1K1 w - -',(!) ... a White pawn on b4 would have held the c-pawn backward and vulnerable.  Black takes immediate advantage of the omission.
563,18,27,2Qb2,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1q3n2/2pp4/8/1P1P2P1/PQ2PPBP/B1R1R1K1 b - -',(!?) The foregoing is not to say that Black was out of the woods yet.  With 22.d4 White could still have faced Black with the problem of his vulnerable pawns e.g. 22.d4 c4 23.bxc4 Rxc4 24.Qb2 Rb4 Black would have lively play and have masked the weakness of his d-pawn (having rid himself altogether of his backward c-pawn) yet White still has that niggling pawn surplus and no real weakness for Black to attack.
564,18,28,2d4,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1q3n2/2p5/3p4/1P1P2P1/PQ2PPBP/B1R1R1K1 w - -',(!) Now I rather like this move though it is true Black has brought back into existence a backward and vulnerable c-pawn.  Against that Black has closed down the long dark-square diagonal for the time being at least.
565,18,29,Nd5,b'2rr2k1/pq3ppp/8/2pn4/2Rp4/1P1P2P1/PQ2PP1P/B3R1K1 w - -',Black has his beady eye on ...Nc3 - an attractive-looking prospect.  But it seems to me that Black's central pawn structure is too unstable for the knight to achieve much there.  Apart from that the rooks can offer no protection for the knight at c3 either.  Maybe 24...Qd7 centralising and overprotecting d4 would have been worth a look.
566,18,30,2e3,b'2rr2k1/pq3ppp/8/2pn4/2Rp4/1P1PP1P1/PQ3P1P/B3R1K1 b - -',(!?) Immediately attacking Black's shaky pawn centre.  Yet there was a lot to be said for regrouping a bit first.  25.Qc1! added pressure against the c-pawn whilst covering the c3 and e3 squares.  Less effective would have been 25.Rec1 (25...Qe7). 
567,18,31,2Rde8,b'2r1r1k1/pq3ppp/8/2pn4/2Rp4/1P1PP1P1/PQ3P1P/B3R1K1 w - -',(?) Pinning the e-pawn (26.exd4?? Rxe1ch ).  But the move is a mistake although the reason is not at all easy to spot!  Better was 25...Qe7 with the same idea of pinning the e-pawn.
568,18,32,2Rec1,b'2r1r1k1/pq3ppp/8/2pn4/2Rp4/1P1PP1P1/PQ3P1P/B1R3K1 b - -',Obvious and good but even better was this tactical shot: 26.Rxc5!! with the idea 26...Rxc5? 27.Qxd4! with a double attack against the c5-rook and against g7 (28.Qxg7#).  This motif forms a curious pendant to the similar double attack opportunities Black had earlier in the game!
569,18,33,2Nc3,b'2r1r1k1/pq3ppp/8/2p5/2Rp4/1PnPP1P1/PQ3P1P/B1R3K1 w - -',As planned and it looks good but the knight can't stay there after say 27.Qd2.  Maybe 26...Nb4 might have given White more to think about...?
570,18,34,2Rc1xc3,b'2r1r1k1/pq3ppp/8/2p5/2Rp4/1PRPP1P1/PQ3P1P/B5K1 b - -',(?!)  A very interesting decision.  It is often worth considering trading down 'at a loss' in order to bring about a more easily realised advantage or in the interests of simpler planning.  This can be especially useful if the defender is otherwise finding plenty of counterplay.  Possibly White was impressed by the counterplay Black had recently conjured up which makes the exchange offer understandable.  At that White may have been figuring on getting 2 pawns for the exchange and hence preserving his material edge.  All the same 27.Qd2 looks much the better option.
571,18,35,f6,b'2r1r1k1/pq4pp/5p2/2p5/2R5/1PQPP1P1/P4P1P/B5K1 w - -',Black had to cover the mate threat at g7 whereat White now picks up the c-pawn...
572,18,36,Rc8,b'2r3k1/pq4pp/5p2/2Q5/8/1P1PP1P1/P4P1P/B5K1 w - -',(!) 
573,18,37,3Qa3,b'2r3k1/pq4pp/5p2/8/8/QP1PP1P1/P4P1P/B5K1 b - -',(!) Just about White's only good move in this position.
574,18,38,3Qc6,b'2r3k1/p5pp/2q2p2/8/8/QP1PP1P1/P4P1P/B5K1 w - -',Playing to win maybe?  Black could have won a piece here by 31...Qf3! 32.Qb2 Qd1ch  33.Kg2 Rc1 but then White can hold everything together by 34.Qd4 Rxa1 35.Qd8ch  Kf7 36.Qd5ch ! with a perpetual check (Not 36.Qd7ch? Kg6  37.Qg4ch?? Qxg4). This would have been a nice exciting tactical finish to the game.  But whether or not Black considered this line he's not compromising much by trying other methods.
575,18,39,Qc5,b'2r3k1/p5pp/5p2/2q5/8/QP1PP1P1/PB3P1P/6K1 w - -',Possibly this offer ought to be avoided here although it is true that the exchange comes later with no ill-effects to Black... Ordinarily the defender (Black) does best to keep pieces on and look to exchanging pawns.
576,18,40,3b4,b'2r3k1/p5pp/5p2/2q5/1P6/Q2PP1P1/PB3P1P/6K1 b - -',(!) Personally I would have exchanged queens but this seems very good decoying the BQ away from protecting the a-pawn.
577,18,41,3Bd4,b'2r3k1/p5pp/5p2/8/1P1B4/Q2PP1P1/P1q2P1P/6K1 b - -',There seems to be no saving the a-pawn unless Black forces the queens off.
578,18,42,3a4,b'6k1/6pp/p4p2/8/PP1B4/3PP1P1/5PKP/2r5 b - a3',(!?) White has preserved a small material edge (B 3P ~ R) and this move looks the logical one to create a second passed pawn on the Q-side.  But it will cost the passer already in existence at d3.  Could White have improved here with 37.Kf3 instead?  E.g. 37.Kf3 Rc2 38.a4 Rd2 39.Ke4 Rxf2 40.b5 axb5 41.axb5 or 37...Rd1 38.Ke2 are by no means definitive sample lines.   The main idea is to steal a march on Black's King in the race for the centre and subsequently the Q-side.
579,18,43,3Rd1,b'6k1/6pp/p4p2/8/PP1B4/3PP1P1/5PKP/3r4 w - -',From here on play is straightforward and easy to follow: White creates and tries to advance his remote passed pawn on the b-file; Black grabs the d-pawn then holds up the b-pawn's progress.
580,18,44,Ke6,b'8/6pp/1P2kp2/8/3BK3/1r2P1P1/5P1P/8 w - -',At this point the players agreed the draw.  Although White has the initiative it seems to me doubtful that he can make sufficient  progress that will create winning chances for him.  The friendly handshake seems a fair reflection of the game: White having the advantage for most of it but with Black contesting every inch of the way.

He has issued a forked attack on both my queen and bishop & I am forced to backpedal.

He's drawn my queen out early.  Offered his knight in an early sacrifice and confused me enough that I didn't even take the proffered piece.  And now he's wrested the momentum from me & is initiating the attack very well.

I seem to have trapped his queen with a little razzmatazz tap dance down to the other side of the board with my rook alternating with a seemingly pointless move by my queen.  What's he gonna do now?  Trade queens?  I'm holding my breath here...
625,19,44,2Qxh2+,b'4r1k1/ppR1p3/3r1pp1/3P3p/4P1n1/6P1/PP2K2q/5RNQ w - -',Looks like a queen trade is inevitable here.

634,19,53,2Ra5,b'4r1k1/4p3/3r2p1/R2P3p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 b - -',Suddenly I realize that pawn's are pieces too--they shouldn't just be left hanging.  Let's protect these guys.
635,19,54,2e6,b'4r1k1/8/3rp1p1/R2P3p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 w - -',Fine.  Jeff's developed a taste for killing pawns.  I'm not going down quietly.   Arrrggghhhh!
636,19,55,2dxe6,b'4r1k1/8/3rP1p1/R6p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 b - -',With a mighty war cry my pawn strikes out & slaughters the pawn that was attacking him.
637,19,56,2Rexe6,b'6k1/8/3rr1p1/R6p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 w - -',He's doubled up his rooks--all of his pieces are grouped together.  He looks poised for an attack.  I'm all over the place.  I'm going to take a moment & think this thing through.
638,19,57,3Ra7,b'6k1/R7/3rr1p1/7p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 b - -',Pay no attention to this little rook all by himself over here...  I'm not planning anything or anything.  Just going over here to catch my breath for a moment.  You go ahead with whatever your plan is.  Don't worry about me. 
639,19,58,3Re8,b'4r1k1/R7/3r2p1/7p/4p1n1/6P1/PP2K3/2R3N1 w - -',Oh poo!  He noticed me.  Now what do I do?

641,19,60,3Nf6,b'4r1k1/R1R5/3r1np1/7p/4p3/6P1/PP2K3/6N1 w - -',"It's that same knight again!  Messing with my plan of attack.  I'm not sure I had much more than that one little attack in me.  That knight really is annoying me.  I swear the next time Jeff and I play I'm taking out his knights right away.  I don't care what kind of position I have to give up.

Oh well back to this game.  What was I was doing?"
642,19,61,3Rcg7+,b'4r1k1/R5R1/3r1np1/7p/4p3/6P1/PP2K3/6N1 b - -',Oh yeah...  Using my doubled up rooks to attack his king.  I remember now.
643,19,62,3Kh8,b'4r2k/R5R1/3r1np1/7p/4p3/6P1/PP2K3/6N1 w - -',Nimbly avoiding my attack Jeff sidesteps very well protected by that cursed knight that he brought back into play.
644,19,63,3Nh3,b'4r2k/R5R1/3r1np1/7p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 b - -',Hey I have a knight!  Let's see if my knight can get into the action here.
645,19,64,3Rd7,b'4r2k/R2r2R1/5np1/7p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 w - -',Doesn't look like Jeff's going to give a chance to mount a serious attack here.  He's throwing that rook around--daring me to trade.
646,19,65,3Rgxd7,b'4r2k/R2R4/5np1/7p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 b - -',I'll do anything to get rid of that knight at this point--especially since I'll end up considerably ahead at the end of this series.  Come & get me!
647,19,66,3Nxd7,b'4r2k/R2n4/6p1/7p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 w - -',Committed to the attack Jeff has no real choice...
648,19,67,3Rxd7,b'4r2k/3R4/6p1/7p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 b - -',Yay!!!!  I killed his knight.  Who cares about the game at this point.  I finally got the knight that I should have taken back near the beginning & I'm content.  Even if everything falls apart from here--at least that knight is out of the picture.
649,19,68,3Re5,b'7k/3R4/6p1/4r2p/4p3/6PN/PP2K3/8 w - -',It's late in the game to come up with a knight advantage at this point but Jeff has a lot of fight left in him.  He moves forward to regroup with his pawns.
650,19,69,3Nf4,b'7k/3R4/6p1/4r2p/4pN2/6P1/PP2K3/8 b - -',Hey look--I have a knight here!
651,19,70,3g5,b'7k/3R4/8/4r1pp/4pN2/6P1/PP2K3/8 w - -',Anxious to regain the advantage Jeff attacks when he should have studied the board a bit more.
652,19,71,3Ng6+,b'7k/3R4/6N1/4r1pp/4p3/6P1/PP2K3/8 b - -',And I get my own deadly fork going.
653,19,72,3Nxe5,b'6k1/3R4/8/4N1pp/4p3/6P1/PP2K3/8 b - -',Now the final warrior from the other side has been vanquished but I know Jeff too well to let up.  He will not quit until every chance at a victory or a stalemate has been exhausted.
654,19,73,3h4,b'6k1/3R4/8/4N1p1/4p2p/6P1/PP2K3/8 w - -',"There's really nothing more to talk about here.  If I don't make a mistake then it's just a matter of moves.  Jeff played an excellent game--I felt like I was behind the whole time & outplayed.  I strung together a couple of good moves here and there but was pushed around almost from the get go.

I don't like to spoil the ending here but I didn't make any glaring mistakes & the  game came to its inevitable conclusion.  Thank you for reading my annotation--I had fun writing it & I hope no one's offended by anything in it.  It was just meant to be fun.

717,22,6,1Nf5,b'r4rk1/pp1qbppp/2np1n2/4pN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now this looks like fun. Possibilities of pressure on the d6 pawn as well as getting my queen to g3.
718,22,7,1Nxd6,b'r2b1rk1/pp1q1ppp/2nN1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Hmmm I guess black didn't want me to exchange my knight for his bishop. I feel that exchange would have been weak for white. As played the bishop was crucial to black's defense of the d6 pawn. The defender removed I see no reason to show mercy.
719,22,8,1Nc4,b'3r1rk1/pp1q1ppp/1bn2n2/4p1B1/2N1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Black added a piece to support his attack against my knight on d6. Moving the knight will allow black to trade queens but I am OK with that since I'm a pawn ahead. F5 was tempting but I chose c4 because I'm considering the havoc I can play against black's pawn structure if he'll let the knight exchange for the bishop on b6.
720,22,9,1Nd5,b'3r1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn1qn2/3Np1B1/2N1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Since the black knight on f6 is pinned I see a chance to wreck pawn structure on both sides or maybe just win a pawn on b6 depending on how black plays.
721,22,10,1Bxd8,b'3B1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn1q3/3Np3/2N1n3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',What I didn't expect black to do was willing give up the exchange. I guess he thought he could recover the material or compensate somehow.
722,22,11,1c4,b'3r2k1/1p3ppp/1pn1q3/3Np3/2P1n3/8/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - c3',Pawn structure damage as planned now to rescue the beleagured knight.
723,22,12,2bxc4,b'3r2k1/1p3ppp/2n1q3/3Np3/2P1n3/8/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now my own pawn structure doesn't look too great. And my knight is still pinned.
724,22,13,2Qe2,b'3r2k1/5ppp/2n1q3/1p1Np3/2P1n3/8/P3QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I thought I had it all worked out. I am now threatening to win black's knight on e4 and also to win the pawn on b5: If 21. ... Nf6 22. Nxf6  followed by 23. Pxb5. Or if 21. ... Ng5 22. Pxb5 and now black can choose to exchange knights or allow both knights to run to safety. 
725,22,14,2Rfd1,b'3r2k1/6pp/2n1q3/1p1Npp2/2P1n3/8/P3QPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',This was probably a mistake on my part. I think I was better off with 22. Pxb5.
726,22,15,2Rxd4,b'3r2k1/6pp/4q3/1p1Npp2/2PRn3/8/P3QPPP/R5K1 b - -',I didn't see 22. ... Nd4 coming. Ouch. I really should have since it was such a nice and obvious move. White cannot counter attack black's queen with 23. Nc7? since 23. ... Nxe2 gives check and lets black save his own queen. 23. Qd3? is met by 23. ... Pxc4 and now both the white queen and white knight are en prise and one must fall. The remaining retreats for the white queen offer no interesting attacks and allow black to play 23. ... Pxc4 recovering some of his lost material and gaining a well-supported passed pawn in the process. So I decide I am better off choosing the fashion in which I give back some of my material lead instead of letting black take it for himself as he chooses.
727,22,16,2Rxc4,b'3r2k1/6pp/4q3/3Npp2/2R1n3/8/P3QPPP/R5K1 b - -',Black had the chance to take the white rook with 23. ... Pxd4 but he chose to refuse my gift. Truth is I am not sure I get much compensation for returning the exchange so I'm fairly glad black refused the gift. As played white can retain his material advantage.
728,22,17,2Rac1,b'3r2k1/6pp/8/3qpp2/2R1n3/8/P3QPPP/2R3K1 b - -',Double the rooks on the c-file.
729,22,18,2Rc4c5,b'3r2k1/6pp/3n4/2Rqpp2/8/8/P3QPPP/2R3K1 b - -',I capitalize on a bit of a miscalculation by black by skewering his queen to his e5 pawn. The queen must move and then the pawn will fall leaving me with a winning material advantage.
730,22,19,2Qxe5,b'3r2k1/1q4pp/3n4/2R1Qp2/8/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',There. Winning edge secured and I've gained an attack as well. I must remain ever vigilant of my back rank or this game could end in a single nasty surprise. However pressing the attack does not give me time to create breathing room for my king so I will have to be careful.
731,22,20,2Qe7,b'3r2k1/4Q1pp/3n4/2R2p2/1q6/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',I think black was considering 28. ... Re8 which pins my queen against the empty e1 square - if I move her away then either 29. ... Re1  or 29. ... Qe1  is followed by checkmate the next move. Of course 29. Qc3 would have prevented this checkmate as would 29. Rc8! (29. ... Nxc8??? 30. Qxe8  ). Since black has no immediate threat it's time to attack.
732,22,21,2Rc5c7,b'1q1r2k1/2R1Q1pp/3n4/5p2/8/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',Black is doomed.
733,22,22,3Qf7+,b'1q1rn1k1/2R2Qpp/8/5p2/8/8/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',And now the final position. Black resigned one move short of checkmate after 30. ... Kh8 31. Qf8  .
734,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was my 18th game against Jo.  We started with a string of draws then she beat me game after game after game (if these had been rated her rating would have been marginally higher mine lower - her choice).  Finally after she's got me playing against masters like Freddy and annotating my games so that they're criticised constructively by the likes of ionadowman easy19 dmaestro nuntar and ruachessnut  (thanks lads) I've finally broken my duck.
735,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',We've been varying the openings a lot.  Jo reverts to traditional territory and I reply with my favourite Sicilian.
736,23,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',At last an orthodox response!  I'm heartily sick of 2. c3 3. c3 2. Nc3 2. Bc4 3. Bc4 2. Bb5 and 3. Bb5 ...
737,23,3,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The Najdorf Variation
738,23,4,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Preparing the English Attack.  I quite often respond with 6. Ng4 which leads to well-analysed and tactically complex lines.  Kasparov was a pioneer in that line.  But I'm no Kasparov and I've been listening to Freddy's advice: sit back ignore the database and wait for Jo to make a mistake.  In this game I did more or less ignore the database.  I relied on instinct background knowledge of the opening theory calculation and feel for the positions.
739,23,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',In the past I've been punished when taking the more aggressive approach of 6. ...e5 so I stick to my favoured Scheveningen formation.
740,23,6,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Again part of the standard English Attack.  This prevents ... Ng4 and prepares g2-g4 as well as reinforcing e4.
741,23,7,Qd2,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',again part of the standard build-up
742,23,8,Qc7,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Before committing myself to kingside castling into the teeth of the gale of Jo's incipient attack I prepare development of my queenside first moving the Q in order to support ...Nc6 so that the a-pawn isn't left isolated after an exchange.
743,23,9,g4,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R b KQkq g3',Again characteristic of the English Attack.  It looks frightening and wins a lot of games.  Black has to remain cool and concentrate on his own opportunities.
744,23,10,Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Development is still my priority but I don't want to commit too early to a wing for my king and I want to challenge White's centre with this N rather than just defend with Nbd7 which deprives the wsb of options and offers no attacking options
745,23,11,1O-O-O,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b kq -',White commits first.  Queenside castling is a standard element in White's English Attack strategy.
746,23,12,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - -',I decide that I can delay White's attack with appropriate counter-measures so castle into the storm after all.  It's now a race to attack the king basically.
747,23,13,1Kb1,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R b - -',?! A typical prophylactic move by White.  But how lily-livered can you get?  Time is of the essence and this does not help White's cause.  Of course if White had won I'd be praising her prescient sagacity!
748,23,14,1b5,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R w - b6',! Launching the attack.
749,23,15,1Nxc6,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1Nppn2/1p6/4P1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R b - -',Avoiding the diversion of her bishop that would occur if Black took on d4 but this N is often a key attacker for White so possibly not the most attacking option: if White is in an attacking frame of mind in these sorts of positions the N often impales itself on b5 e6 or f5....
750,23,16,1Bd3,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p1qppn2/1p6/4P1P1/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R b - -',looks at h7 and defends e4  and c2 but blocks the battery down the d-file: so it has its advantages and disadvantages.  Alternatives were 13. Be2 and 13. Bg2.
751,23,17,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1qppn2/1p6/4P1P1/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R w - -',Better than 13. ...Bd7 when it would be vulnerable on the d-file.  The important thing is to connect the rooks and to launch the attack at White's King's position.  Admittedly this B is pointing in the wrong direction for that objective; but it does look across the centre of the board at e4 f3 and a1.
752,23,18,1g5,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1qppn2/1p4P1/4P3/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R b - -',White makes contact.

756,23,22,1Qg2,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p1qpp3/1p2n1P1/4P2P/2NBBP2/PPP3Q1/1K1R3R b - -',Defending f3 and reinforcing the attack from behind.
757,23,23,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p1qpp3/1p2n1P1/4P2P/2NBBP2/PPP3Q1/1K1R3R w - -',Calmly completing development and building pressure on c2
758,23,24,1Rdg1,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p1qpp3/1p2n1P1/4P2P/2NBBP2/PPP3Q1/1K4RR b - -',Committing to the kingside storm

760,23,26,Qxc4,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/1p4P1/2q1P2P/2N1BP2/PPP3Q1/1K4RR w - -',Now Black's attack is as potent as White's I think.
761,23,27,1Qe2,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/1p4P1/2q1P2P/2N1BP2/PPP1Q3/1K4RR b - -',?! Especially now that Glenda abandons attacking duties for a glorious pas de deux into the burning fires with the Wicked Witch.  I wonder of this was the turning point?
762,23,28,1b4,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/6P1/1pq1P2P/2N1BP2/PPP1Q3/1K4RR w - -',Black now presses home the attack. 
763,23,29,2Qxc4,b'2r2rk1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/6P1/1pQ1P2P/2N1BP2/PPP5/1K4RR b - -',Glenda pulls the Wicked Witch into the fire.
764,23,30,2Rxc4,b'5rk1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/6P1/1pr1P2P/2N1BP2/PPP5/1K4RR w - -',and the Elephant grinds her into the ashes.
765,23,31,Rfc8,b'2r3k1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/6P1/1pr1P2P/4BP2/PPP1N3/1K4RR w - -',Black's doubled rooks are a much more powerful weapon than White's muted fellows stuck behind their pawns.
766,23,32,2Rgc1,b'2r3k1/1b2bppp/p2pp3/6P1/1pr1P2P/4BP2/PPP1N3/1KR4R b - -',and now one of White's rooks reverts to defensive duty.  A good example of flexible thinking from Jo: though perhaps she lacks commitment to her attack?
767,23,33,2d5,b'2r3k1/1b2bppp/p3p3/3p2P1/1pr1P2P/4BP2/PPP1N3/1KR4R w - -',Good timing I think.  If White advances to e5 she gains no tempi from it and she doesn't have any obvious ways of pressing home the attack.  Black sorts out a weakess in his position and turns it into an attacking option.
768,23,34,Bxd5,b'2r3k1/4bppp/p3p3/3b2P1/1pr4P/4BP2/PPP1N3/1KR4R w - -',Preserving the positional integrity of Black's kingside pawn structure while turning Blacks wsb into an attacking piece: f3 is under direct attack and a2 is under potential threat.
769,23,35,2Rh3,b'2r3k1/4bppp/p3p3/3b2P1/1pr4P/4BP1R/PPP1N3/1KR5 b - -',Defends f3 and prepares doubling on the h-file.  Moving the f3 pawn wasn't an option because of ... Bxh1
770,23,36,2a5,b'2r3k1/4bppp/4p3/p2b2P1/1pr4P/4BP1R/PPP1N3/1KR5 w - -',Preparing the final lunge at Henry's position.  A couple more moves and White's pawns will have very difficult choices.
771,23,37,2f4,b'2r3k1/4bppp/4p3/p2b2P1/1pr2P1P/4B2R/PPP1N3/1KR5 b - -',At last White gets another pawn moving.
772,23,38,2Be4,b'2r3k1/4bppp/4p3/p5P1/1pr1bP1P/4B2R/PPP1N3/1KR5 w - -',but left e4 open to occupation.  Now c2 looks sick
773,23,39,2Nd4,b'2r3k1/4bppp/4p3/p5P1/1prNbP1P/4B2R/PPP5/1KR5 b - -',defending c2 but from an awkward forward position
774,23,40,2Bc5,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p1b3P1/1prNbP1P/4B2R/PPP5/1KR5 w - -',attacking the defender single-mindedly
775,23,41,2Nb3,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p1b3P1/1pr1bP1P/1N2B2R/PPP5/1KR5 b - -',returning the compliment; but Black's B dsb is not required in the attack on c2 whereas that N was.
776,23,42,2Bxe3,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p5P1/1pr1bP1P/1N2b2R/PPP5/1KR5 w - -',! Of course revealing once more the battery on c2!
777,23,43,Bxc2+,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p5P1/1pr2P1P/1N2R3/PPb5/1KR5 w - -',Probably decisive.
778,23,44,2Ka1,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p5P1/1pr2P1P/1N2R3/PPb5/K1R5 b - -',? I think White should have accepted the loss of the exchange here.
779,23,45,2Bxb3,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p5P1/1pr2P1P/1b2R3/PP6/K1R5 w - -',! winning
780,23,46,Bxc4,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/p5P1/1pb2P1P/4R3/PP6/K7 w - -',and Jo waved the white flag on grounds of ruinous loss of material.  After all my struggles against her a surprisingly easy win.
781,24,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',54th GK Tournament game I choose the Sicilian.
782,24,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',The Philidor Variation characterized by White's 2. Bc4.
783,24,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I'm not sue what was gained by 3. a3 unless white was planning b4 (never played) or really early in anticipating that I might move a knight there.
784,24,3,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/P1PP4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',Seems like a good time to strike at the center.
785,24,4,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/P1PP4/BP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Ready to castle. Black has a strong center and 3 pieces developed to white's 1 and I'm not sure that a2 is an ideal place for a bishop. Maybe white will soon lament his loss of tempi and the fact that so many of his pieces are still on their starting squares.
786,24,5,Qe7+,b'r1b1k2r/pp2qppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/P1PP1Q2/BP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',White goes after a pawn so I go after a king.
787,24,6,Ne5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2qppp/3b1n2/2ppn3/8/P1PPQ3/BP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Not quite ready to exchange the royal ladies. I might yet find a use for her.

789,24,8,Bf5,b'r3k2r/pp2qppp/3b4/2ppnb2/6n1/P1PP4/BP1QNPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Adding pieces to the fray threatening the pawn at d3.
790,24,9,Nxd3+,b'r3k2r/pp2qppp/3b4/2pB1b2/6n1/P1Pn4/1P1QNPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',White pounced on the defenseless d5 pawn but I'm not sure he had much else. If 12. O-0 then Nf3  13. gxf3 Qh4 is fairly decisive though white can sacrifice his queen on f4 to prevent immediate checkmate.
791,24,10,Ngxf2,b'r3k2r/pp2qppp/3b4/2pB1b2/8/P1Pn4/1P1QNnPP/RNB2K1R w kq -',Now the white rook falls. 14. Rg1 is met by 14. ... Bxh2

793,24,12,Qf6+,b'r3k2r/pp3ppp/3b1q2/2p5/8/P1PQ4/1P2N1PP/RNB2K1n w kq -',Keeping up the pressure and hunting those kingside pawns.

795,24,14,Qxg2,b'r3k2r/pp3ppp/3b4/2p5/8/P1PQ4/1P2N1qP/RNBK3n w kq -',Just munching pawns building the material and positional advantage. White cannot take the undefended bishop with 19. Qxd3 because 19. ... Rd1 wins the white queen (rook bishop for queen isn't much of a win but it's sufficient to ensure the bishop's safety). At this point I really expected white to put me in check with 19. Qe3  to which I didn't have any clever replies - just consolidating my forces and eventually bringing my rooks to bear on the open center and exposed white king.
796,24,15,Nf2+,b'r3k2r/pp3ppp/3b4/2p5/8/P1PQ4/1P1NNnqP/R1BK4 w kq -',19. Nd2?? was ostensibly an attempt to bring some of the underdeveloped white pieces into play but after black's reply white is royally forked and resigns immediately.

Qh5?! followed by Nh6?...when simply Nc6 leave Black with an excellent game. 2...Qe7 is ok but doesn't really do much to explain why white's second move isn't taken seriously.

Thanks  for the suggestion  I will use Nc6 in the future I like that. The reason this move cannot be taken seriously is that he brought queen out early and he lost it. There is a reason masters are masters and a reason why they choose not to immediately pull out the bazooka and start blasting before a single pawn has been dropped."

I can only be comforted by the fact that my opponent was too cowardly and classless to grant me a rematch."
820,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My opponent resigned on move 26 with a scathing note accusing me of playing like a computer.  He put me on ignore not allowing any discussion on the subject whatsoever.  What is fascinating to me is how he came to this conclusion as to me it seems like a very straightforward game.  So here are my thoughts on the game.  
821,27,1,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',There doesn't seem to be any mystery about what is going on.

830,27,10,2Ra8,b'r2q1rk1/R2bbpp1/3ppn1p/p7/1pNNP1P1/1P1PBP2/P2Q3P/2R3K1 w - -',nope no exhange for me

Now I have played quite a few games on gameknot my ratings graph alone will show that there is a very close match with the rating of the player vs the win or loss.  I had greatly enjoyed this game as I was losing quite a few games around then.  Saddened me that this player was such a poor sport.  I don't use computers to play my games of course there is no way for me to prove it; but if you agree with me can you let my opponent know?  His name is goffredob.  Thanks

871,30,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',but Black has equalised now since White's d-pawn is still at home.
872,30,7,Bxf6,b'r2qr1k1/pp1b1pp1/5b1p/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Now Black has the advantage of the Bishop Pair on a  relatively open board.  Can he use it?

Developing the B first gives Black's N nowhere to develop.  Fianchettoing the B leaves weak dark squares everywhere on the kingside while the B bites on granite.  So the plan is ....Nge7-g6 followed by ...Be7 and kingside castling and continuing expansion on the queenside though I have to be careful about White's Bs which control the diagonals b1-h7 and c1-h6 and a lightning strike by White's Q and Ns on my kingside.

If Black takes White's kingside attack can start with the N retaking on g5 releasing the Q for kingside action.

This opponent had previously employed the Samisch to attack my King's Indian Defense when we last played with the same colors. The success of the KID in that game had me on red alert for what to expect from this encounter.
1036,36,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I proceed with my KID.
1037,36,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This introduces the Trompowsky Attack. White does not want a conventional King's Indian Defense and intends to take the game into original territory by exchanging bishop for knight and doubling Black's f-pawns. 
1038,36,3,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',White has essentially put the question to the knight (and the pawns that would have had to recapture). Black has a number of responses here including 2_c5 2_e6 and the text. I prefer the text because it often leads to active positional play and because I also like reflecting White's strategy by putting the question back on the bishop.
1039,36,4,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3PnB2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',3.h4 is also currently fashionable.

1041,36,6,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PnB2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Now White enters one of the most popular lines of the Tromp. Whether the game remains open or closed (and it can do both from this tabia in my experience) the play is usually very sharp. Since my worthy opponent had previously employed the Samisch it seems fitting here that he employs a system with a similar pawn structure (f3) that is so thematic in that opening as well. This move does challenge the knight on the e4 square but it does so at the cost of White taking away the best development square from his own knight (see previous note).
1042,36,7,Qa5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/8/q1p5/3PnB2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',This is the point of Black's previous move. It allows the knight on e4 to influence White's game before it has to retreat (or be exchanged).

1059,36,24,1Na5,b'r3kb1r/1p1n1ppp/p2pbn2/N3p1B1/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b Kkq -',I had considered this when I first played 12_Be6. The knight attacks the pawn on b7 and readies for Nc4. 
1060,36,25,1b6,b'r3kb1r/3n1ppp/pp1pbn2/N3p1B1/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR w Kkq -',I considered 14_b5 directly here but it appeared to give Black some counterplay with 15.b3 and 16.c4. Here is where I made the real decision that losing the d6 pawn is ok AND that castling would actually remove Black's king from its important influence in the center.
1061,36,26,1Bxf6,b'r3kb1r/3n1ppp/pp1pbB2/N3p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b Kkq -',Making the d6 capture possible.
1062,36,27,1Nc4,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/pp1pbn2/4p3/2N1P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b Kkq -',White's plan is realized.
1063,36,28,1b5,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/p2pbn2/1p2p3/2N1P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR w Kkq -',Move the pawn that can be defended.
1064,36,29,1Nxd6+,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/p2Nbn2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b Kkq -',Check!
1065,36,30,1Bxd6,b'r3k2r/5ppp/p2bbn2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR w Kkq -',I'm glad I didn't waste a tempo putting the bishop on e7.
1066,36,31,Ke7,b'r6r/4kppp/p2Rbn2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/4KBNR w K -',Now Black really isn't threatening the White rook (which can simply move away) but the text does free the other Black rook. That said now look at the White kingside.
1067,36,32,1Rd2,b'r6r/4kppp/p3bn2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP1R2PP/4KBNR b K -',Where else was it going to go?
1068,36,33,1Bxa2,b'r6r/4kppp/p4n2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/bP1R2PP/4KBNR w K -',The d6 pawn is avenged! If I can keep the d-file from being infiltrated by a White rook battery with my king and minor pieces then I can attack the queenside freely wih my rooks.
1069,36,34,2Ne2,b'r6r/4kppp/p4n2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/bP1RN1PP/4KB1R b K -',Developing the knight with future plans such as 21.f4 or 21.Nc1 & 22.b3.
1070,36,35,2Nd7,b'r6r/3nkppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/2P2P2/bP1RN1PP/4KB1R w K -',I can always retreat the bishop and be happy with it on e6 so I decide to meet the possibility of 21.f4.
1071,36,36,2Ng3,b'r6r/3nkppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/2P2PN1/bP1R2PP/4KB1R b K -',The bishop had to get free somehow.
1072,36,37,2g6,b'r6r/3nkp1p/p5p1/1p2p3/4P3/2P2PN1/bP1R2PP/4KB1R w K -',Taking away squares for the knight. And once my bishop almost inevitably retreats e6 I will have f-file ideas of my own.
1073,36,38,Be6,b'r6r/3nkp1p/p3b1p1/1p2p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1P1RB1PP/4K2R w K -',It was going to happen eventually. 
1074,36,39,2Kf2,b'r6r/3nkp1p/p3b1p1/1p2p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1P1RBKPP/7R b - -',Logical.
1075,36,40,2Nc5,b'r6r/4kp1p/p3b1p1/1pn1p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1P1RBKPP/7R w - -',Headed for queenside play.
1076,36,41,2Rhd1,b'r6r/4kp1p/p3b1p1/1pn1p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1P1RBKPP/3R4 b - -',White is now the owner of a d-file battery. But what can be done with it?
1077,36,42,2Rhc8,b'r1r5/4kp1p/p3b1p1/1pn1p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1P1RBKPP/3R4 w - -',I continue the queenside offensive.

1079,36,44,2Rab8,b'1rr5/4kp1p/p3b1p1/1pn1p3/4P3/2PB1PN1/1P1R1KPP/3R4 w - -',Preparing for b4.
1080,36,45,2Bc2,b'1rr5/4kp1p/p3b1p1/1pn1p3/4P3/2P2PN1/1PBR1KPP/3R4 b - -',Logical follow through from the previous move.

1082,36,47,2Ne2,b'1rr5/4kp1p/p3b1p1/2n1p3/1p2P3/2P2P2/1PBRNKPP/3R4 b - -',Bringing the knight closer to the fray.
1083,36,48,2a5,b'1rr5/4kp1p/4b1p1/p1n1p3/1p2P3/2P2P2/1PBRNKPP/3R4 w - -',Keeping up the pressure.

1085,36,50,2a4,b'1rr5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/pp2P3/2P1KP2/1PBRN1PP/3R4 w - -',I thought this move forced White to take the pawn on b4. The alternative is queenside domination.
1086,36,51,2cxb4,b'1rr5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/pP2P3/4KP2/1PBRN1PP/3R4 b - -',Forced?
1087,36,52,2Rxb4,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/pr2P3/4KP2/1PBRN1PP/3R4 w - -',Black breaks through knowing that White now has the forces to liquidate the queenside pawns.
1088,36,53,3Nc3,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/pr2P3/2N1KP2/1PBR2PP/3R4 b - -',White goes after the pawn.
1089,36,54,3Rxb2,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/p3P3/2N1KP2/1rBR2PP/3R4 w - -',Black accepts the trade.

1091,36,56,3Rb4,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/2n1p3/Br2P3/2N1KP2/3R2PP/3R4 w - -',The bishop still seems wanting for squares though.
1092,36,57,Nb3,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/4p3/1r2P3/1nN1KP2/2BR2PP/3R4 w - -',The knight attacks the White rook while preparing for Nd4 and leaves a discovered attack on White's knight on c3. 
1093,36,58,Nd4,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/4p3/1r1nP3/2NRKP2/2B3PP/3R4 w - -',Black occupies the strong outpost on d4 and White is running out of maneuvering room. 
1094,36,59,3Rc1,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/4p3/1r1nP3/2NRKP2/2B3PP/2R5 b - -',A hard move to make.
1095,36,60,3Rb2,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/4p3/3nP3/2NRKP2/1rB3PP/2R5 w - -',Black penetrates the White position.
1096,36,61,3Bd1,b'2r5/4kp1p/4b1p1/4p3/3nP3/2NRKP2/1r4PP/2RB4 b - -',35.Ba4 would amount to the same thing.
1097,36,62,3f5,b'2r5/4k2p/4b1p1/4pp2/3nP3/2NRKP2/1r4PP/2RB4 w - f6',This is not so much my resisting the pawn grab 35_Rxg2 in as much as its my failing to resist a mate threat with 36_f4.
1098,36,63,3g3,b'2r5/4k2p/4b1p1/4pp2/3nP3/2NRKPP1/1r5P/2RB4 b - -',I can still grab a pawn on the Black kingside. But that mate threat...has it really been nullified?
1099,36,64,3g5,b'2r5/4k2p/4b3/4ppp1/3nP3/2NRKPP1/1r5P/2RB4 w - -',Nope.
1100,36,65,3Rxd4,b'2r5/4k2p/4b3/4ppp1/3RP3/2N1KPP1/1r5P/2RB4 b - -',Forced.
1101,36,66,3Kxd4,b'2r5/4k2p/4b3/5pp1/3KP3/2N2PP1/1r5P/2RB4 b - -',And now that I am up the exchange I will surely grab the h2 pawn and try to convert it to a win right? My last game with this opponent proved to me that I need every last advantage.
1102,36,67,3Rd2+,b'2r5/4k2p/4b3/5pp1/3KP3/2N2PP1/3r3P/2RB4 w - -',I see something more appealing.
1103,36,68,Rxd1,b'2r5/4k2p/4b3/5pp1/4P3/2N1KPP1/7P/2Rr4 w - -',Two for one!
1104,36,69,f4+,b'8/4k2p/4b3/6p1/4Pp2/2rRKPP1/7P/8 w - -',The point of the previous liquidation.
1105,36,70,Bb3,b'8/4k2p/8/8/4Pp2/1b1K1P2/7P/8 w - -',Making way for the king on the important e-file and lusting after the f3 pawn.
1106,36,71,Bd1,b'8/7p/5k2/8/4Pp2/5P2/7P/3b1K2 w - -',Originally I played this to pin the king down to the defense of the f-pawn. But then I realized that the pawns are equal in the number of their potential moves on the h-file. This seemed a small fact but it made my next move possible.
1107,36,72,4Kf2,b'8/7p/5k2/8/4Pp2/5P2/5K1P/3b4 b - -',Defending.
1108,36,73,4Bxf3,b'8/7p/5k2/8/4Pp2/5b2/5K1P/8 w - -',This was what I realized on my last move. Once the King recaptures there is nowhere for him to go that can protect the e4 pawn. And since the h-file is moot he has no choice in the matter.
1109,36,74,4e5+,b'8/7p/5k2/4P3/5p2/5b2/5K1P/8 b - -',Amounts to the same thing.
1110,36,75,Kf5,b'8/7p/8/5k2/5p2/5K2/7P/8 w - -',And the game is over (though White resigned a few moves later).
1111,36,76,Ke4,b'8/8/8/7p/4kp2/7P/4K3/8 w - -',
1112,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a return game against heart-bleeads I lost the first game now with white. I have to admit there is no opening I know better than the absolute standard one so here it goes.
1113,37,1,h3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I didn't even want him to think about going to g4 with his bishop so I stopped him preemptively.

An exchange could have occurred due to the unprotected knight on c6 which would have been interesting but not necessarily giving white any great positional advantage. There was also the chance of [8...Na5] which was actually played which costs the bishop advantage for white but leaves the knight posted in a forward position looking at c6.

It seemed that [10...Nf6] was better because the knight is posted in a solid defensive position. The text move seems to suggest perhaps a future sacrifice at f3 but I did not see how this could be made to work within the next few moves so I felt at ease.
1200,38,12,1Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1N5/1p1p2n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The text move attacks the queen primarily but also opens a line for the rook on the e file. Yes its an unsecured move but it can be maintained with the proper application of attacking moves.
