Who can tell?....but what this move does signify is a willingness on the part of white to totally rip up the middle of the board.

45,1,8,Qxg2,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/5N2/PB3PqP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black's appetite for white pawns is almost insatiable.
46,1,9,Rg1,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/5N2/PB3PqP/RN1QK1R1 b Qkq -',Black's greed is going to be his downfall. This move secures the g file for white. Look at the forces being brought to bear on  f7 and g7.
47,1,10,Bb4+,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/5N2/PB3PqP/RN1QK1R1 w Qkq -',Black finally develops with an aggressive check.

57,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game deals with the exchange sacrifice - one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of modern chess. Most commonly it involves an exchange of a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight - either for a direct attack or for positional reasons.
58,2,1,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The Kings Indian is still one of the best choices for Black if he wants a dynamic game with good attacking possibilities on the King-side.
59,2,2,h3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',A very rare line indeed! The move is more flexible than it looks. First of all it takes away a lot of squares from Black´s c8-Bishop. In case of a White Bishop-move to e3 it can´t be attacked by a Black Knight-move to g4 - and if White should decide to castle long he has the move g4 in hand with an attack on the Black King.
60,2,3,a6,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',I don´t think this is Black´s best option. Attacking the centre with Pawn-moves like c5 or e5 seems more active.
61,2,4,a3,b'r1bqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/P1NBBN1P/1P3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ -',"A bit of a ""luxury""-move but Nb4 by Black could be annoying."

White´s Bishop on d3 is not much worth either at the moment but it gets new life when play moves to one of the flanks.
63,2,6,1Rb6,b'r1q1r1k1/3bnpbp/pR1p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P3/P1NBBN1P/3Q1PP1/5RK1 b - -',"This leads to the exchange sacrifice and I must admit that I had no idea if it would do the trick or not. Many of these sac.´s are played more by ""gut feeling"" than long calculations."

65,2,8,Nd7,b'r3r1k1/3nnpbp/p2q2p1/1PpPp3/4P3/P1NBBN1P/3Q1PP1/1R4K1 w - -',!? After 19. - axb5 20. Nxb5 White has plenty of play against the Pawns on c5 and e5 plus a potentially dangerous passed Pawn on d5. My feeling was that White had more than sufficient compensation for the exchange but absolutely nothing is clear yet!
66,2,9,2axb7,b'r5k1/1P1nnpbp/3q2p1/2pPp3/4P3/P1NBBN1P/3Q1PP1/6K1 b - -',The Pawn on b7 will tie down Black´s pieces for a while and give time for re-grouping. Now 22. - Rxa3 could be answered by 23. Qb2 with a double-threat of Nb5 or promoting the Pawn.
67,2,10,f5,b'1r4k1/1P1nn1bp/3q2p1/2pPpp2/4P3/P1NBBN1P/1Q3PP1/6K1 w - f6',Black desperately needs to find some counterplay or White´s two Queenside Pawns will decide the game.

69,2,12,2Ne6,b'1r5k/1P1nn1bp/B3N1p1/2pPpp2/4P3/P1N1B2P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',Even with the Queens off Black is still under a lot of pressure and his pieces are not well co-ordinated. Now another Pawn has to go.
70,2,13,Rg8,b'6rk/1P1nn2p/B2BNbp1/3Pp3/4Pp2/P1N4P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',In this kind of position it becomes clear why a Rook can be a terrible defender.
71,2,14,3Nac5,b'6rk/1P1nn2p/B2BNb2/2NPp1p1/4Pp2/P6P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',White takes final control over the promotion-square b8 which will cost Black at least a piece. Therefore Black chose to resign. I hope this game will inspire you to look more for the option of the exchange sacrifice. If it works it is a great weapon!

Strategically removing the rook from the long diagonal preparing to re route the Queens knight is a sound idea. However you have to be able to check Black's initiative in the center and Queenside at the same time preparing an attack on the Kings wing. In my book this is just too slow. The more popular main line with Be3 prepares a central advance and also prepares to swap dark squared bishops with Qd2 and Bh6.

It's unclear to me if after 13...Kc5 14.e6+? d5 White still has a forced mate in this position.  Black's King is horribly exposed on d5 but White needs more dudes activated in order to force mate.  Houdini calculates only a forced drawing line after 15.a4 Nc4 16.Qf4 Ba5 17.Ba3+ Nxa3 18.Qd4+ Kd6 19.Qf4+ Kxe6 (19...Ke7 20.Qf7+ Kd6 21.Qf4+ and Black will need to eventually take on e6 if he wishes to vary) 20.Re1+ Kd7 21.Qf5+ Kd6 22.Qe5+ Kc5 23.Qd4+ Kd6 24.Qe5+ 1/2-1/2.

Can you just imagine what was going through the minds of Steinitz and other top players of that era when they saw this? (assuming they ever did). I'm sure they probably thought that Anderssen was a direct relative of Caissa:) I hope you have enjoyed it:) More famous games are forthcoming and I appreciate all the kind words I have received for posting them with my own meager analysis.

294,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game remained fairly even throughout the match despite both of us having chances to take the initiative. In the end it came down to endgame tactics and I came out top.
295,13,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I have experimented with the sicilian (1...c5) however much prefer to meet the pawn head on with this move
296,13,2,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Up to this point both sides have developed solidly so it's difficult to say that anyone side stands better perhaps black because white has one pinned piece but it's still no real advantage
297,13,3,Na4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/N1B1P1b1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Played to remove the well placed bishop correct response is 7...Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nd4 9. Qd1 putting the knight on a good square and removing the knight on f3 which is a good defender of the king
298,13,4,Nd4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/N1BnP1b1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',A plausible move but a slight mistake as I will point out in a couple of moves
299,13,5,dxc5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2p1p3/2BnP1b1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now the mistake is apparent although difficult to see... If white now continues 9. Bxf7  Kxf7? 10. Nxe5  Kf8 11. Nxg4 then white emerges 2 pawns ahead and black has a very exposed king
300,13,6,Be3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2p1p3/2BnP1b1/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Missing the opportunity although not a terrible move it develops another piece to a good position and semi-pins the knight to the undefended pawn (semi because I can give check to avert the pin)
301,13,7,Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1P3/3PBP1b/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w kq -',This move is made with 2 purposes to defend the pawn on c5 and to release the queen into the kingside with the potencial to make a devastating check along the g-file if the position allows it.
302,13,8,1f4,b'r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1PP2/3PB2b/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b kq -',A clever move again with 2 objectives making the g-file less available and releasing the queen so she can defend the king if needed
303,13,9,1Qh5,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/5q2/2p1p2Q/2B1PP2/3PB2b/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 b kq -',This move aims to trade off material either with a queen exchange after 13...Qg6  or trading bishops as in the game. With such an open king and the black queen and bishop lurking this is a good plan.
304,13,10,1fxe3,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/5q2/2p5/2B1P3/3PP2Q/PPP4P/R3R1K1 b kq -',I played for this exchange as in the position I felt I had the better attacking options so wanted to keep queens on the board. The exchange has also opened up the white king further.
305,13,11,1Qg5+,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/8/2p3q1/2B1P3/3PP2Q/PPP4P/R3R1K1 w kq -',I feel that 15...Qxb2 would be a mistake as after something like; 16. Rab1 Qxc2 17. Rxb7 Qd2 (attacking the rook) 18. Reb1 then white looks to have the better position
306,13,12,Ne5,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2p1n1q1/2B1P3/3PP2Q/PPP2K1P/R3R3 w kq -',This position looks very aggressive for black although white has plenty of counterplay however I couldn't see a knock out blow so this move Ne5 aims to remove the bishop and so doubles the pawns on the c and e-files which should give me an advantage in the endgame 
307,13,13,Qf6+,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/2p1n3/2B1P3/3PP2Q/PPP2K1P/R5R1 w kq -',Forced in order to protect the g7 pawn
308,13,14,1Qf5,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/2p1nQ2/2B1P3/3PP3/PPP2K1P/R5R1 b kq -',Having decided to play for the endgame I accept this queen exchange as I can capture the bishop after white takes my queen
309,13,15,2dxc4,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2p2P2/2P5/4P3/PPP2K1P/R5R1 b kq -',In this position white looks better as his king is more advanced and he has 1 active rook however I remain confident in my endgame abilities and it shouldn't be too hard to at least force a draw. In rook endgames like this rook activity is essential even being a pawn down can be made up for by well placed rooks
310,13,16,2g6,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/6p1/2p2P2/2P5/4P3/PPP2K1P/R5R1 w kq -',The only move 20...Rg8 leads to 21. f6 which is rather awkward after 21...Kf8
311,13,17,2f6,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/5Pp1/2p5/2P5/4P3/PPP2K1P/R5R1 b kq -',This pawn is over extended without backup I want to mobilise my rooks but must first get my king out of the way. This pawn gives me a target and is a distraction to white as he has to try and defend it
312,13,18,2Rad1+,b'r6r/pppk1p1p/5Pp1/2p5/2P5/4P3/PPP2K1P/3R2R1 b - -',This seems good as it brings his other rook to a good square on an open file however he needed to play something like Rg5 (attacking the c5 pawn) as my king is headed to the e6 square anyway
313,13,19,2Rgf1,b'r6r/ppp2p1p/4kPp1/2p5/2P5/4P3/PPP2K1P/3R1R2 b - -',Again Rg5 is preferable

315,13,21,Rd8+,b'3r4/ppp2p1p/4kPp1/2p5/2P5/4P3/PPP4P/3K1R2 w - -',Now the position is very much in my favour white looks certain to lose the pawn and with little compensation in position (his king is back on the 1st rank)
316,13,22,2h4,b'8/ppp2p1p/3r1Pp1/2p1k3/2P2R1P/4P3/PPP1K3/8 b - h3',A weak move better would be to use his active rook with either Rg4 (threatening Rg5 ) or Rh4 (threatening the undefended pawn) although neither is particularly billiant
317,13,23,Kxf6,b'8/ppp2p1p/5kp1/2p5/2P4P/4P3/PPP1K3/8 w - -',With my kingside majority I was confident of forcing a victory although I nearly messed it up!!

321,13,27,3Kxg5,b'8/ppp2p2/8/2p1k1K1/2P5/2P1P3/PP6/8 b - -',Even despite the blunder this should be a comfortable victory with my well placed king.
322,13,28,3b4,b'8/ppp2p2/8/2p3K1/1PP1k3/2P1P3/P7/8 b - b3',I was anticipating Kf6 as this is the best move although I noticed my opponent taking a while on this move (we were both online) so he perhaps calculated this line as a losing one (which I think it is) so wanted to try something different however this is a bad blunder allowing me to stroll arround gobbleing up his pawns
323,13,29,Kd3,b'8/ppp2p2/8/1Pp3K1/2P5/2Pk4/P7/8 w - -',And my opponent decided to call it a day before it became too bloody. Even after a variation like 37. Kf6 Kxc4 38. Ke5 Kxc3 its easy to see my c-pawn will promote and win the game
324,14,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',The Dutch Defense
325,14,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Blocking his c-pawn White aims for rapid development and the central break e2-e4.  Black can clamp down on e4 with 3...d5 but that would cost him the e5 square after 4.Bf4 and a future Ne5.
326,14,2,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppppb1pp/4pB2/5p2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White exchanges in order to break with e2-e4.  The inherent problem with the Dutch Defense is the early weakening of the kingside with 1...f5.  Now a strong kingside defender (the f6 Knight) has been eliminated making Black's kingside even weaker.   The only down side for White is giving up the prized Bishop Pair.
327,14,3,e4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/5p2/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq e3',White is missing his dark-squared Bishop.  Therefore recommended here for Black is 6...d5 which forces White to clarify his intentions in the center.  The text move allows White to fully justify his opening strategy.
328,14,4,fxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/8/3Pp3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Not best as it activates White's QN.
329,14,5,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp2pp/1p2pb2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black aims for a queenside fianchetto combined with pressure down the f-file after ...O-O.
330,14,6,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp2pp/1p2pb2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The Knight on e4 is at least equal to the Bishop on f6 so White refrains from further exchanges and continues developing.  Here the d3 Bishop takes aim at Black's kingside.
331,14,7,Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp2pp/1p2pb2/4N3/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"A provocative move threatening Qh5 !  White does not mind if Black trades one of his Bishops for one of White's powerfully centralized Knights.  Let's take a look at some variations.

If 9...Bxe5? then 10.Qh5 ! (zwischenzug) and White recovers the piece with a centralized Queen and a better position since Black is forced to give up castling or weaken his kingside with 10...g6.

Also weak is 9...Bxe4? 10.Bxe4 where Black has parted with his fianchettoed Bishop along with his light squares.  The Rook on a8 is attacked making 10...d5 absolutely forced.  Other blocking moves are worse; 10...c6 is inadequate in light of 11.Qd3 g6 12.h4! (12...Bxh4?? 13.Bxg6 ! is crushing); and of course not 10...Nc6?? 11.Nxc6 dc 12.Bxc6  and White wins.  Returning to 10...d5 White simply plays 11.Bd3 with a clear advantage due to the backward e-pawn and the outpost square on e5."
332,14,8,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pbpp2pp/1p2pb2/4N3/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Castling into the storm!  Although time-consuming in retrospect it might have been better for Black to engineer queenside castling.

I actually had the rare privilege of playing this same game against a computer on the Internet Chess Club.  The crazy thing was the computer rated around 2100 fell victim to the ""horizon effect"" a well-known phenomenon where a chess engine cannot ""see"" the final mate position because it simply cannot calculate far enough into the position (beyond its horizon).  In this position the engine probably calculated 6 moves ahead and assessed that Black is ""safe"" after 10...Qe7 since h7 is guarded and there is no way to force mate in 6.

My opponents slow development caused his position to be lost.

I have played 5. 0-0 Nxe4 6.Bxc6 (sets up my knight to take e5 later) bxc6 7.Nxe5 followed by white playing Re1 and opening an attack on the black king. Or maybe I have the order wrong.. maybe 7.Re1 forces black to defend the N on e4 then white can play Nxe5.

The other move for white maybe 5.d3 (defends e4)
or 5.c3 sets up attack with a d5 push later.

This position has given me heaps of thought and I've been inclined in many games to play 5.0-0.
What do you think?"
429,19,2,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"(evgraan)Good analysis. You are on the right track. Let's look at the options you list:
c3 is not as frequently played and seems to favour black at high levels of play.
O-O is definitely the most widely played but black does not have to play 5. ... Nxe4. If he does though good move orders are: 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 Nc5 7. Bxc6 dxc6 8. d4 Ne6 9. Nxe5 Be7 10. Be3 O-O 11. f4 with a good game for white or perhaps 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 Nc5 7. Bxc6 dxc6 8. d4 Ne6 9. Nxe5 Be7 10. c3 O-O 11. Be3 with a good game for both players. 6. Bxc6 seems to work out OK for white but I'm not sure if it gives white a lasting advantage. It seems as though white has a tough time getting an advantage in the RL but as I say I'm not an expert. Probably a good RL book is the way to go!!
5. d3 is quieter than 5. O-O and does not lead to such wild play as 5. O-O does : ) If you're playing a good positional player who is weak on tactics 5. O-O could be the way to go. If you're playing a more tactical player and you're comfortable with positional play 5. d3 could give you an edge. A good classical lines are: d3 d6 6. c3 g6 7. Nbd2 Bg7 8. Nf1 O-O 9. Ng3 b5 10. Bc2 d5 11. O-O or 11 Qe2 with good games for white.
Also consider 5. Qe2 and 5. d4! I'll leave these for you to read up on : )
In this game though black is going to try and beat you on tactics since you've opened the door for some interesting play with 5. O-O ; ) Let's see how your 6. Bxc6 does?"
430,19,3,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',(kiaoi)ok lets go for it. 6.BxN bxB with an opening of the b-file for rook attack. I have read that white doesn't get much out of trading bishop for knight so early. I like the idea of d4 but I think it'd be better after BxN. so here we go...
431,19,4,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',(evgraan) Ahah but here black throws you a curve ball because after bxc6 Nxe5 notice that black has 3 pawn islands... hmm not so good so black decides to play with his pawns and make sure he only has 2 pawn islands by playing the much more popular 6. ... dxc6! This also opens the diagonal for the bishop on c8... where-as bxc6 would have left the bishop blocked on b7 by the c6 pawn... Also now black's queen has got some scope down the d-file. So it seems to make more sense to play dxc6...
432,19,5,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',"(kiaoi) I've seen both 6..bxc6 and 6..dxc6 play. I'm still unsure of which is better as bxc6 opens the b file for the Rook to exploit and also gives two centre pawns whilst dxc6 has the advantages u have spoken of. with dxc6 i really can't play 7.d4 anymore. I think 7.Re1 forces you to move the knight or protect it.
7.Qe2 is also good I think whereafter I could double up on the e file with Re1 and put real pressure on your pieces. Other moves could be 7.b3 to fianchetto bishop but I think this is too slow.
So I forsee this:
7.Re1 f5 8.Nxe5 Be7... and now where does my knight go?!?!?!?! This is where I get lost. Do I continue to develop and wait until the knight gets kicked off its square? and now I question grabbing the e-pawn.
Well maybe 9.d3 forces your knight away and I keep developing as I do have my Rook on the e-file"
433,19,6,Nc5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/2n1p3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',(evgraan) Okay Re1 is a good move. 7. ... f5 I don't like as it weakens black's king-side. The pawn on e5 is going to fall and with the white rook on e1 pushing f5 would place black in hot water. The move most played here for black is 7. ... Nc5. This keeps the knight eyeing the centre gets it to safety and under the protection of the f8 bishop. Also it allows the knight to potentially hop back to e6 in defence of the king since the e-file would be open with white's rook lining up for a shot at black's king. 7. ... Nf6 has also been played but Nc5 seems more versatile. Nc5 does open up the d4 option for white again and this should help answer your question re: where does white's knight go. The answer in the short term is: no-where! The knight on f3 can now pounce on the e5 pawn after which d4! could follow supporting the knight. The knight will be well centralized on e5 and black would be unwise to weaken his kingside with f6... so the knight could sit very well on e5.

But I like 8.d4 Ne3 9.Nxe4 Be7 10.d4 to support knight. This position looks like black is cramped with the light bishop blocked until the king is out of the open e-file. 
435,19,8,Ne6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p1n3/4p3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Indeed the white knight looks nice on e5 : ) Let's see how the position plays out! This is a vital time for white as in the next few moves he sets the tone for the game. I syspect white has a brief opportunity for a lasting advantage here and black threatens to equalize after O-O so white must make the most of his position in the next few moves! 
436,19,9,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p1n3/4N3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',"I will continue with the original plan. I can plan attacks on f7 by Qf3. If black pushes f6 then that might mess my plans. But does Black usually play this? as it weakens the kingside maybe to get the knight out of the way. Black may play to develop so 9..Bd6 develps and gets attacks the knight. 10.f4?? Weakens castled king but maybe it can work to consolidate the centre with two pawns. I think this is where my problem is trying to find a long term strategy or to develop one. I will try and play for control of the centre so if black follows up with 10...c5 11.c3.
Is that good strat or do you think develop the pieces is better at this moment?"

Black's position is solid but he needs space. and time to develop so O-O tries to give some space. A primary concern for black is the strong knight on e5...

Games Databases show many players choosing Nd2-f3 while black tries to break the centre with c6-c5. Eventually whites d-pawn will be isolated after the exchange so I guess the knight move to f3 is good for the centre pawn protection. I also considered Be3 before the Knight's moves to f3 but can't see much difference in the order of movements.
439,19,12,1c5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3n3/2p1N3/3P4/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',"Hmm Nd2 has the draw-back of blocking white's bishop on c1 and reducing the influence of white's queen on the center... This limits white's options. For example as you rightly say c5 followed by Ndf3 opens the bishop up again but this has allowed black counterplay in the center. The more immeditate 11. Be3 prevents black from playing c5 thus solidifying white's control of the center. White's had quite a bit of success with 11. Be3 where-as 11 Nd2 seems drawish giving away some of the momentary advantage that white has built up in the center by allowing c5. Also note that allowing black to play c5 has longer-term consequences. Black is heading for an end-game where he'd probably benefit from having two bishops (e.g. cxd4 Nxd4 NxN cxN and black ends up with the two bishops). So open diagonals help black. In allowing c5 white opens up the a5-e1 diagonal after exchanges on d4 giving black more space. Also the pawn on d4 becomes an isolated target tying down some of white's minor pieces to keep an eye on protecting it... Perhaps a good way of looking at the position before 11. Nd2 or 11. Be3 is to ask the question which of the central squares (d4 e4 d5 and e5) are in contention? White ""owns"" e4 with his rook on e1 and black ""owns"" d5 with his queen on d8 The white knight is sitting solidly on e5 but the square in most contention is d4! (This is obvious after c5 has been played but the trick is to notice the possibility of c5 and the accompanying contention!) Moving the knight to d2 blocks white's queen support of this hotly contested square while adding control to the already-solid e4 square. Thus from my point of view it seems better to rather play Be3 focusing more white muscle on d4. If you keep in mind that white's advantage in this opening line is his central space and control the moves should come more natural at this point in the game : )"

White has lost his opening advantage though so black stands equal in my opinion. Black's first task is to get rid of his double c-pawn and chip away at the strong white center and then to arrange his minor pieces for activity so black's goals are as follows:
1) weaken d4
2) strengthen the black center
3) develop minor pieces.
How do you think black can accomplish this? The first move is clear- cxd4."

White can reply with 14.Bd2 where the exchange helps white?!? (I think) 14...BxBd2 15.QxBd2. Games DB sees black play 13.cxd4 Qd5 which I can only see that it tries to develop out the light square bishop and then join the rooks. The other move was 13.cxd4 Bf6 attacking the Knight. I think that is ok for white as the other Knight can recapture at e5 if the bishop takes it. Whites 14th move will depend on what black plays here.
442,19,15,1c6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1p1n3/4N3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',(evgraan) Well done good analyses. There is something to note here though. White's pawn on d4 ia what is called an IQP Isolated Queen's Pawn. Now in your analyses you mention in both cases exchanging some pieces... this is not a good idea when you are the side playing with the IQP. Why is this? Well the IQP is a double-edged sword. In the middle-game where we now find ourselves the IQP is an advantage as it provides support points for launching an attack. So for example it you look at the knight on e5 he is very strong with the support of the pawn on d4. Also c5 could be a potential launching point supported by d4. The second advantage of the IQP in the middle-game is it's potential advance. So here d4 - d5 would be trouble-some for black. With each step the pawn comes closer to the back rank and potentially queening but it also scatters enemy forces along the way. The third advantage of the IQP is that it limits the enemy's piece movement. The opposing side might find it difficult to find good squares for his minor pieces and may have trouble getting those pieces to those squares. I suspect especially with an IQP on the 4th and 5th rank this may make life difficult for the opponent. Sounds great doesn't it? Well there is a disadvantage as well. In the long-term if we were to take all the minor pieces and the queens off the board black would probably have the better end-game since the isolated pawn is weak... hence my earlier statement that exchanging pieces is not a good idea for white here. Rather white should try and extend the middle-game for as long as possible trying to mount an attack of some kind using his IQP as support. The opponent on the other hand should try and exchange pieces to create more space and lessen the potency of an attack. Secondly the opponent should try and block the IQP from advancing. This is done primarily by placing a minor piece in front of it and thirdly the opponent should try and attack the IQP since it is st
443,19,16,1Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1p1n3/4N3/3P4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Well a lot to consider. Ideally I want the Q to be on b3 to attack b7 but also have ready the protection for a pawn push if black plays c5. But if the black knight moves to c7 then there's a problem in that. The long term goal maybe to develop the black bishop and it only looks good at e3 position which will then allow Qb3 and then Rook to d1. I don't like the look of black playing to B-b4 which will force me to move the Rook on e1. Tempting is to push the a-pawn to a3 but i think this is a 'slow' move. I've heard that somewhere and i should focus on developing my pieces. With that in mind I think Be3 is the go to protect the pawn.
444,19,17,1Nc7,b'r1bq1rk1/1pn1bppp/p1p5/4N3/3P4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',(evgraan) Well done! Be3 is probably the best move here. Black continues with his plan. Be3 seems OK for the bishop for now but note that after Nc7 and the logical Nd5 the bishop on e3 is under attack. One move order you might consider is: Nc7 followed by Bf4 followed by Nd5 and then Bg3 pro-actively getting your bishop to a good square (why is g3 a good square for your black bishop? Please think of at least 3 reasons if you could).
445,19,18,1Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pn1bppp/p1p5/4N3/3P1B2/5N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',"i would never have thought of playing Bishop there. I did think of exchangin but then i realise 3 pawn islands and knights v bishops. Why is it good to play Bto f4 then g3? Maintains one bishop and i don't want to exchange while I have the isolated pawn. It defends the central knight. It opens up the e-file for my rook. I guess this is where I stuff up. I usually play blindly and not analyse enough and I think without your comment I would play Qb3 which is bad of course as stated above!!
But what about a Bishop retreat to d2 that to me looks ok as it controls a lot of squares available to the Knight on d5. Actually I think in the long run the bishop would be out of place after I get the other rook to d1 for to protect and then I'd have to move the bishop again with the only good square for it on c1. "

504,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',With the white pieces Morphy played 1. e4 exclusively. An interesting side note is that Bobby Fischer considered Paul Morphy the strongest player ever and he as well played 1. e4 most of his career (with the glaring exceptions of the 1972 World Championship).
505,23,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Philador Defense.
506,23,2,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? Allowing Morphy too many options. He can lock up the center destroy the center or freely develop. Better was to simply take the d pawn. After all maintaining material equality this early in a game is vital against a player of Morphy's strength.
507,23,3,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Morphy swings first. He sees that he can a trade a knight for a bishop after 4...BxN because 4...dxe4 is abysmal due to 5.QxQ KxQ and black has lost the right to castle.
508,23,4,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black probably sees this too and obliges.
509,23,5,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Morphy now has a threat  against f7 that must be dealt with immediately.
510,23,6,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Blocking the attack on f7 and developing.
511,23,7,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Finding a new way to maintain the pressure on f7 and eying b7 as well.
512,23,8,Qe7,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',The only way to protect f7. The pawn on b7 is now hanging. However.......
513,23,9,Nc3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Instead of taking on b7 Morphy develops his knight to c3 which threatens to move to d5. White is now solidly ahead in development as black's dark squared bishop is trapped.
514,23,10,c6,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',? Black is behind in development and this move makes little sense. Keep your eyes on the open d file and the weakness of black's queenside. Does black actually think he can get away with playing b5?
515,23,11,Bg5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',! Obvious move but still great. Look at what it accomplishes. It develops it pins the Nf6 against the enemy queen and it enables castling long which puts a rook on an open file!
516,23,12,b5,b'rn2kb1r/p3qppp/2p2n2/1p2p1B1/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq b6',Evidently black thinks DOES think this play will work.

518,23,14,1Bxb5+,b'rn2kb1r/p3qppp/5n2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Black is now officially on the ropes. Nbd7 is black's only logical response and after castling queenside Morphy will have awesome pressure on d7.
519,23,15,Rd8,b'3rkb1r/p2nqppp/5n2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w k -',Practically forced.
520,23,16,1Rxd7,b'3rkb1r/p2Rqppp/5n2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2K4R b k -',! A nice sac. If black recaptures with his knight his queen is lost. If he recaptures with his Rd8 or his queen that piece will continue to pinned against his king and succeptible to capture.
521,23,17,1Rxd7,b'4kb1r/p2rqppp/5n2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2K4R w k -',The lesser of three evils.
522,23,18,1Rd1,b'4kb1r/p2rqppp/5n2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b k -',"! Why take the rook immediately? There is no hurry as it isn't going anywhere. Better to keep ganging up on it and not allowing black any counterplay whatsoever. If they could speak I wonder what black's dark squared bishop and Rh8 would say? Probably something along the lines of ""LET US OUT OF HERE!!!"
523,23,19,1Qe6,b'4kb1r/p2r1ppp/4qn2/1B2p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w k -',A last chance effort to free the bishop while offering to exchange queens. Problem is it is WAY too late.
524,23,20,Nxd7,b'4kb1r/p2n1ppp/4q3/4p1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w k -',If the queen takes she is lost.
525,23,21,1Qb8+,b'1Q2kb1r/p2n1ppp/4q3/4p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b k -',! There is nothing quite like a beautiful queen sacrifice that forces mate in one! Game over.......
526,23,22,1Rd8#,b'1n1Rkb1r/p4ppp/4q3/4p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/2K5 b k -',Truly a great one. As with most great attacking players Morphy utilized the concept of TIME in his mating combinations. Just look at the final position of the board - if the victor were decided by who captures the most enemy material Morphy didn't stand a chance. However there is but one aim in this great game and that is CHECKMATE! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did:) - Thomas
527,24,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game is a Bogo-Indian which features some key positional ideas for the Black pieces.
528,24,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here White wishes to avoid the Nimzo-Indian and is probably hoping for 3...b6 when the Queen's Indian Defense will lead him into lines where White has a good chance for a small but persistent advantage.
529,24,2,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I however prefer Efim Bogolubov's defense.
530,24,3,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Here White could transpose into the Nimzo-Kasparov Variation with 4. Nc3 however this move and 6. Nbd2 keep things in Bogo territory.
531,24,4,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',The purpose of this move is two-fold as it prevents the exchange of Bishops after which White would lose a pawn and it prepares an eventual e5 by playing Nc6 exchanging the Bishops and then playing d6 and finally e5 with active play on the kingside.
532,24,5,Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black has a few options here however I like the consistency and straight forwardness of playing for a quick e5.
533,24,6,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',"A slight inaccuracy on my part.  6...Bxd2 allows White the opportunity to play 7. Qxd2?! where after 7...Ne4 8.Qc2 Qb4  White has to make some unpleasant choices;

1) 9. Kf1 d5
2) 9. Nc3 Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3 11. bxc3 b6 where White's weak pawn structure will be an endgame disadvantage.
3) 9. Nbd2 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 Qxc4 or 10. Nxd2 Nxd4 and White doesnt have sufficient compensation for the pawn."
534,24,7,Bxd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1bPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Why the exchange?  Black gets the opportunity to exchange of Bishop for Bishop rather than Bishop for Knight also the Queen's Knight will be less aggressively placed on d2.
535,24,8,Nbxd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',8. Qxd2 is parried with 8...Ne4 and ...f5 when Black has strong play on the Kingside.

1) White's knight on d2 is misplaced
2) White's bishop is hemmed in by it's center pawns;
3) Black is behind in development however the fact that the center is closed makes this a minor drawback.  Black indeed has a strategically sound position."

546,24,19,1b5,b'r4rk1/1p1bqppp/n2p1n2/1PpPp3/2P1P3/1Q3NP1/3N1P1P/R1R2BK1 b - -',If 17. bc then the outpost is on c5.  Black has plenty of Queenside counterplay and plenty of good squares for his pieces.

The main continuation is 10. e5 Nd7 11. f4 e6 when Black is going to play c5 in the near future with a spatial advantage on the Queenside and a quicker attack.  Note that 12.

I like the Center Counter against an unknown opponent as it is safe and easy to play. The drawback is that it doesn't fight for a win like the Sicilian but I am content with my endgame skills. If I can win a pawn I will trade down and try to outplay my opponent in the endgame.
590,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',It is most common to trade pawns on d5 since white can play 3. Nc3 to gain a tempo on the queen. The text can transpose to a French Advanced pawn structure.

607,26,18,1Ne7,b'r3k2r/pp2np1p/2q1p1p1/2bpP3/6Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',It is imperative that I get my king to safety by castling and even though the pawn cover is compromised the kingside is still better than the queenside.

The knight was going to move next turn anyway (taking the bishop) so kicking at it was pointless and this weakens the pawn cover of the white king. If white wanted to launch a pawn attack it would be more normal to attack with the h pawn as black's g pawn is the one advanced.

737,30,17,2Rxb7,b'8/pR5p/2r5/6p1/1B4k1/2P5/PP3P1P/6K1 b - -',Make two pawns.
738,30,18,Rd8,b'3r4/4R3/8/P5p1/1B5p/2P4k/1P3P1P/6K1 w - -',With the hopeful trheath 34.-Rd1 mate.
739,30,19,3Ba3,b'8/8/8/P5p1/7p/B1P4k/1P1r1P1P/4R1K1 b - -',35.-a6 could have been triyed too but i just wanted to play safe.
740,30,20,3hxg3,b'8/8/P7/8/7p/B1P3Pk/1P1r1P2/4R1K1 b - -',Black resigned.
741,31,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the first time I have played macduffee but I usually answer d4 with ...Nf6 to keep my central pawn options open.
742,31,1,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',An interesting move that leads me to think a Colle is coming. I used to play the Colle quite a bit as white but more recently have moved to the Scotch Game. It would be fun to play the black side of a Colle.
743,31,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Keeping my options open should white play c4 and transpose into more normal lines.
744,31,3,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',And we are back at a more normal position. I can play ...Bb5  if I want to head into a Bogo-Indian but that is not what I play with black.
745,31,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I prefer a Queen's Gambit Declined.
746,31,5,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',And now we are out of book. This can't be a good move theoretically but as a surprise tactic it may be playable. It certainly caught me by surprise.
747,31,6,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Threatening to win a pawn with ...bxc5 and ready to meet cxb6 with axb6 opening the a file for my rook.
748,31,7,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/1P1P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',But white wants to bolster his pawn on c5.
749,31,8,a5,b'rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/p1Pp4/1P1P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq a6',So I attack the defender.
750,31,9,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/pPPp4/3P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This drops a pawn but white seems more interested in gaining queenside space.
751,31,10,Ba3,b'rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pPpp4/3P4/B3P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Finally developing a piece but I'm not sure what this accomplishes. Maybe looking to trade on f8 if black plays ...cxd4 but that trade doesn't really do anything for white.
752,31,11,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3p4/B3P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',So I will take another pawn.
753,31,12,Rxf8,b'rnbqkr2/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3p4/4P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq -',And now black can castle by hand with ...Ke7 ...Re8 ...Kf8. But for the time being the king is safe where he is.
754,31,13,exd4,b'rnbqkr2/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQq -',Getting back one of the pawns but I don't see that white has enough compensation for his sacrificed pawn.
755,31,14,c6,b'rnbqkr2/5ppp/2p1pn2/pP1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq -',Hoping for bxc6 when I can recapture with the knight and increase my lead in development.
756,31,15,1bxc6,b'rnbqkr2/5ppp/2P1pn2/p2p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQq -',And white obliges.
757,31,16,1Nxc6,b'r1bqkr2/5ppp/2n1pn2/p2p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq -',After 10 moves we can take stock of the opening. Black is up a pawn and has both knights developed. The only piece white has that isn't on its starting square is the d4 pawn. If this was a boxing match white would get a standing eight count.
758,31,17,1Bb5,b'r1bqkr2/5ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQq -',Developing a piece with an attack. Maybe this will be a game after all.
759,31,18,1Bd7,b'r2qkr2/3b1ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQq -',As I am up a pawn I will look for ways to trade down to an endgame. This prepares to offer a trade of bishops. Oh yeah and it breaks the pin :)
760,31,19,1Nf3,b'r2qkr2/3b1ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1QK2R b KQq -',Nice developing move that prepares castling.
761,31,20,1Nb4,b'r2qkr2/3b1ppp/4pn2/pB1p4/1n1P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1QK2R w KQq -',White's a pawn can kick the knight from this position at any time but the point was to trade the bishops off.
762,31,21,Qxd7,b'r3kr2/3q1ppp/4pn2/p2p4/1n1P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1QK2R w KQq -',Mission accomplished.
763,31,22,1O-O,b'r3kr2/3q1ppp/4pn2/p2p4/1n1P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b q -',White gets castled but if I can get the queens off my king will be safe even without castling. And in an endgame my king will be closer to the center which is an advantage.
764,31,23,1Ke7,b'r4r2/3qkppp/4pn2/p2p4/1n1P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',But I must release the king's rook.
765,31,24,1a3,b'r4r2/3qkppp/4pn2/p2p4/1n1P4/P4N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Getting rid of the knight.
766,31,25,1Nc6,b'r4r2/3qkppp/2n1pn2/p2p4/3P4/P4N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',The knight resumes his attack on the isolated d pawn. I probably can't get enough pressure on it to win it but maybe I can stretch white's resources enough to allow some other weakness to arise.
767,31,26,1Qd3,b'r4r2/3qkppp/2n1pn2/p2p4/3P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',Eyeing the h pawn and getting the queen off the back rank to help connect the rooks.
768,31,27,1h6,b'r4r2/3qkpp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/3P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',Not only does this release the f6 knight from the obligation of defending the pawn on h7 it takes away the g5 square from white's knight. The drawback is that if the f6 knight moves away white's queen can invade on h7 and the g7 pawn is weak. But I am not worried.
769,31,28,1Nc3,b'r4r2/3qkpp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/3P4/P1NQ1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Finishing development.
770,31,29,1Rfc8,b'r1r5/3qkpp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/3P4/P1NQ1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Putting a rook on an open file is standard middle game strategy.
771,31,30,1Rfc1,b'r1r5/3qkpp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/3P4/P1NQ1N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Which white is aware of also :)

773,31,32,1Na4,b'r1r2k2/3q1pp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/N2P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Heading for the nice outpost on c5.
774,31,33,1Qa7,b'r1r2k2/q4pp1/2n1pn1p/p2p4/N2P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Again I don't remember what I was thinking here except that the queen has to go somewhere when the black knight gets to c5.
775,31,34,2Nc5,b'r1r2k2/q4pp1/2n1pn1p/p1Np4/3P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',And white's knight is strong here covering important squares in the black camp.
776,31,35,2Nd7,b'r1r2k2/q2n1pp1/2n1p2p/p1Np4/3P4/P2Q1N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',So I attempt to trade it off.

778,31,37,2Nxc5,b'r1r2k2/q4ppQ/2n1p2p/p1np4/3P4/P4N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Getting rid of the strong knight as I think I can successfully blockade the c pawn.

780,31,39,Nb3,b'r1r5/q3kpQ1/2n1p2p/p2p4/3P4/Pn3N2/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',But by not recapturing on c5 white lost a piece and with this move black wins the exchange also. As white does not want to continue a rook down he resigns. 0-1
781,32,0,Qxe3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2NPQ1P1/PP3PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',fxe3 would have been a better option here providing coverage against Nd4.  Once lodged in there with the black bishop gone that knight is a nuissance and a half.

Trading knights and going down one pawn would have been the better option.  Followed immediately by Kb1 and then Qf2.  Much much better.

876,36,16,1Ne4,b'r3k2r/p2p1p1p/4pp2/8/1bp1N3/4P1P1/P4PKP/2R2R2 b kq -',White's knight is a perfect example of the stength a blockading knight has constantly lashing out from it's post on c3. Black's job here is to tame the knight to force it to stay on c3. With the knight on c3 black doesn't have to defend his pawn all that hard since the knight blocks the pawn from frontal assault.
877,36,17,1Be7,b'r3k2r/p2pbp1p/4pp2/8/2p1N3/4P1P1/P4PKP/2R2R2 w kq -',The strategy of taming a wild knight is to take away the squares it can use. Here the knight threatens f6. Bringing the bishop home defends not only the pawn but the f6 square itself.

881,36,21,Rxd8,b'2kr4/p3bp1p/4pp2/8/2p1p3/2N3P1/P4PKP/2R5 w - -',More pieces off the board (my intention). Now it's just rook vs rook and the stalion vs the stodgy bishop. The pawn on e4 is of no importance.
882,36,22,Rd4,b'2k5/p3bp1p/4pp2/8/2prN3/6P1/P4PKP/2R5 w - -',But the knight has to be imprisoned on c3.
883,36,23,2Nc3,b'2k5/p3bp1p/4pp2/8/2pr4/2N3P1/P4PKP/2R5 b - -',White must be sick of playing Nc3 by now.
884,36,24,2Kd7,b'8/p2kbp1p/4pp2/8/2pr4/2N3P1/P4PKP/2R5 w - -',This move keeps with the principle of eliminating effective squares for the knight. Now Nxa7 won't give check. The c7 square isn't safe for the king because of Nb5 giving check.
885,36,25,2Nb5,b'8/p2kbp1p/4pp2/1N6/2pr4/6P1/P4PKP/2R5 b - -',White continues to lash out with the knight.
886,36,26,2Rd5,b'8/p2kbp1p/4pp2/1N1r4/2p5/6P1/P4PKP/2R5 w - -',And black continues to slowly tame him. Nxa7 is now impossible due to Ra5 trapping the knight. Notice how this wouldn't be possible if Nxa7 gave check.
887,36,27,2a4,b'8/p2kbp1p/4pp2/1N1r4/P1p5/6P1/5PKP/2R5 b - a3',Oh yeah the rook move threatened the knight. I can't let it get too secure there since my c pawn is en prise.
888,36,28,2a6,b'8/3kbp1p/p3pp2/1N1r4/P1p5/6P1/5PKP/2R5 w - -',Back! Back to c3!
889,36,29,2Nc3,b'8/3kbp1p/p3pp2/3r4/P1p5/2N3P1/5PKP/2R5 b - -',That's better. The knight's an effective blockader but his range is slowly being reduced.
890,36,30,2Rc5,b'8/3kbp1p/p3pp2/2r5/P1p5/2N3P1/5PKP/2R5 w - -',An in-between move inviting Ne4. The idea is to keep white from doing anything productive. 28. Ne4 Rc6 and white doesn't have anything useful to do. He can play g4 or h4 or f4 or whatever but f5 would eventually force the knight back to c3.
891,36,31,f5,b'8/3kbp1p/p3p3/2r2p2/P1p2P2/2N3P1/6KP/2R5 w - -',I was going to play f5 anyhow to take control of the e4 square and post the bishop on f6.
892,36,32,2Rb1,b'8/3kbp1p/p3p3/2r2p2/P1p2P2/2N3P1/6KP/1R6 b - -',Whoa! can't have this. Let's get the rook back where it belongs...

As I mentioned before the plan is to develop the bishop to b7 and take control of the long diagonal.  The move b6 was also a possibility but b5 was a nice little trap.

If white plays spontaneously 7) Bxb5 he loses the bishop to 7) ... Qa5  forking the king and bishop.  The only way to defend both threats is 8) Nc3 after which black wins a piece with 8) ... Nxc3.  This trap is a good one to watch out for.

Besides setting a trap b5 also takes up more space on the queenside after being eventually backed up by a pawn on a6.  This is an example of a good trap: one that improves your position while giving your opponent an opportunity to make a blunder.  The only potential downside to this move is that it weakens the c5 square and this will come to show later in the game."

Qb6 has the immediate threat of winning the d4 pawn but Nd6 is a much more strategical move.  Nd6 would prepare my knight to infiltrate at either c4 or a4 (probably c4) which would put it at a good outpost.  Nd4 would also start to clear up the long diagonal for my white bishop.

In this case though I was concerned about the possibility of him playing Rxc8.  This would force my to take back with either my bishop or my knight and that would put the bishop or knight in an inactive spot and waste time.

This move also had a bit of wishful thinking.  After the pawn recaptures the bishop white's king will be open to attack.  The fact that I have only three pieces left afterward makes it a bit obscure but his open king position proves to be a big weakness later in the game.

Also this move changes the nature of the game a bit.  After the bishop is recaptured we will have a bishops of opposite color scenario.  I have a black bishop while white has a white bishop.  If the bishops stay on the board and the queens and knights get traded off the resulting endgame will almost definitely be a draw.  I won't go into too much detail on bishops of opposite color here but it's useful to know that the endgame of bishops of opposite colors tends to be very very drawish."

All I did was lose the positional advantages I gained from moving the queen to c7.  Fortuanately for me I didn't lose the game because of this move but I think I should have played Ne7 instead.  This would prepare the knight to move to d5 and attack the weak e3 pawn.

999,38,44,2h6,b'6k1/4npp1/pq1bp2p/1pN5/1P1P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 w - -',A good defensive move and much better than the alternative of g6.  If 26) ... g6 then white has the option of 27) Qh6 putting the queen on a powerful square near my king.
1000,38,45,2Qh5,b'6k1/4npp1/pq1bp2p/1pN4Q/1P1P1P2/P2BP3/7P/6K1 b - -',To be honest I'm not sure what the point of this move was.  It has a similar feel to my 24th move: a queen move that doesn't really do anything specific and lets the opponent continue on with their plans.
1001,38,46,2Nd5,b'6k1/5pp1/pq1bp2p/1pNn3Q/1P1P1P2/P2BP3/7P/6K1 w - -',Finishing the knight maneuver and attacking the weak pawn on e3.
1002,38,47,2Qh3,b'6k1/5pp1/pq1bp2p/1pNn4/1P1P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 b - -',Defending the pawn on e3.
1003,38,48,2a5,b'6k1/5pp1/1q1bp2p/ppNn4/1P1P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 w - -',"A possible mistake on my part as it allows him a tactical shot.  Immediately after I played this move I saw the possible move for him and started getting a bit nervous.

White's possibility was this: 29) Nxe6!.  If I play 29) ... fxe6 then he plays 30) Qxe6  forking my king and my knight ultimately winning two pawns with the combination.  A possible continuation I looked at was 30) ... Kf8 (Kh8 loses by force) 31) QxNd5 axb4 32) axb4 Bxb4 33) Qxb5 Qxb5 34) Bxb5.  I didn't look into many quirks in the position but I relaxed a hair when I realized that it would become an endgame with bishops of opposite color so I would stand a good chance at a draw.

In any case the position after white's 28th move was a sort-of static one.  I knew that I wanted to undermine his powerful knight and a5 was the only move I saw that had a chance at doing so."
1004,38,49,2bxa5,b'6k1/5pp1/1q1bp2p/PpNn4/3P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 b - -',"Fortunately for me my opponent didn't see the tactical shot that I did.  This move was probably a bit of a mistake on white's part as it does exactly what I wanted to do: lessen white's control of the c5 square.

The line that follows was calculated out by both of us and was the turning point of the game.  Unfortunately for him he didn't see a small nuiance in the position that allowed me to grab an insurmountable advantage on move 31.  To be honest I didn't see the move either until the position arrived."
1005,38,50,2Qxa5,b'6k1/5pp1/3bp2p/qpNn4/3P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 w - -',I was still worried about the white knight capturing on e6 but I had no real alternative.
1006,38,51,3Nb7,b'6k1/1N3pp1/3bp2p/qp1n4/3P1P2/P2BP2Q/7P/6K1 b - -',Forks the queen and bishop.  The entire line played by white puts white in a worse position but this isn't made clear until move 31.
1007,38,52,3Qxa3,b'6k1/1N3pp1/3bp2p/1p1n4/3P1P2/q2BP2Q/7P/6K1 w - -',The only move.  Now I have a potentially powerful passed pawn on b5.  Also if white plays 31) NxBd6 I will play 31) ... QxBd3 getting rid of the bishops of opposite color and preparing to push my b-pawn while attacking his weak pawn on e3.
1008,38,53,3Bxb5,b'6k1/1N3pp1/3bp2p/1B1n4/3P1P2/q3P2Q/7P/6K1 b - -',The only alternative for white is to get rid of my passed pawn and even the material.  Unfortunately for white my next move proves decisive.
1009,38,54,3Bxf4,b'6k1/1N3pp1/4p2p/1B1n4/3P1b2/q3P2Q/7P/6K1 w - -',! Taking the free pawn and preparing to take on e3.  White cannot take back because his pawn on e3 is pinned to his queen!  Now both of white's minor pieces are shuttled to the side of the board allowing me to pick off his central pawns and move into a winning endgame.  Note that I could have taken the pawn with the knight to attack his queen but the attack of the pawn on e3 by the bishop is much stronger.
1010,38,55,3Bc4,b'6k1/1N3pp1/4p2p/3n4/2BP1b2/q3P2Q/7P/6K1 b - -',The only idea I see behind this move is to remove a piece attacking e3 but it's a little too late.

1012,38,57,3Kh1,b'6k1/1N3pp1/4p2p/3n4/2BP4/q3b2Q/7P/7K b - -',The only move.  If 33) Kg2 then 33) ... Nf4  wins the queen.  If 33) Kf1 then 33) ... Qc1  [or Qc3 ] 34) Kg2 [or Ke2] ... Kf4  winning the queen.
1013,38,58,3Qa1+,b'6k1/1N3pp1/4p2p/3n4/2BP4/4b2Q/7P/q6K w - -',I was looking for some way to fork one of his minor pieces but couldn't find one.  So I went with forking the final central pawn instead.
1014,38,59,Qxd4,b'6k1/1N3pp1/4p2p/3n4/3q4/4b2Q/7P/5B1K w - -',While taking the pawn this also has ideas of trapping the white's knight with Qb6.
1015,38,60,3Nd8,b'3N2k1/5pp1/4p2p/3n4/3q4/4b2Q/7P/5B1K b - -',Possibly preparing one last shot of taking on e6 with the knight and then the queen.
1016,38,61,3Nf4,b'3N2k1/5pp1/4p2p/8/3q1n2/4b2Q/7P/5B1K w - -',Attacks the queen and defends e6.  There's a bit of irony in that my pieces are all exactly where all his central pawns used to be.
1017,38,62,3Nxe6,b'6k1/5pp1/4N2p/8/3q1n2/4b2Q/7P/5B1K b - -',Taking a pawn with hopes of exchanging queens but the position is basically lost by now anyway.  I could simply take back on e6 and win a piece.  However when you find a good move look for a better one.
1018,38,63,3Qe4+,b'6k1/5pp1/4N2p/8/4qn2/4b2Q/7P/5B1K w - -',Qd5  works just as effectively.  If 37) Qf3 then 37) ... Qxf3  and black wins the queen.  If 37) Qg2 then 37) ... Nxg2 and black wins the queen.  That leaves one legal move left for white.
1019,38,64,3Bg2,b'6k1/5pp1/4N2p/8/4qn2/4b2Q/6BP/7K b - -',Now my queen is under attack as well.  One final (and relatively simple) move wins the game.
