Unrated practice game between Mistee and Alex388

1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"In this game we have an e4 opening which is the most traditional White's first move. It's a direct approach to the possession of the center while it frees the white bishop and the queen.
In the other side black respond with a Sicilian defense which is also the most played defense against 1. e4 and also the best-scoring against it. The main idea behind c5 move is to control d4 square and fight for center with an asymmetrical position.

Develop Principles:
- Fight for center
- Try to develop your knights before the bishops
- Do not move again the same piece unless it's required
- Take your pieces out with time gains or threatening something"

Nf3 is the main line keeping the attack and control of the center while Nc3 is more a ""psychological"" move where White waits Black to move (mainly Nc6 or e6) so it can discard d6 move which leads to a Nadjorf defense. Also Nc3 could be another way to start the ""Grand Prix Attack"" (1. e4 c5 2. f4 ..)"

We notice that in Sicilian Defenses is very common to see lots of pawn moves instead of pieces moves. This is a contradiction to the principles but is firmly based on the theory of the defense which with the the space gain tries to catch up in the development."

Here black could have played 3. .. d5! instead of 3. .. a6 fighting for the center from the beginning. In most Sicilian's defenses the defending player must know to many lines and theory so I strongly recommend to new player to avoid those approaches and follow chess principles. In this case fight for the center.
A common line here could have been:
1. e4 c5
2. Nc3 e6
3. Nf3 d5
4. exd5 exd5
5. d4 Nf3"

Better ways to develop the white bishop in this situations could be:
a) g3 and then Bg2 doing a fianchetto.
b) playing 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 (probable for black) 6. Bd3 a better diagonal for the white bishop because it supports a future e5 advance attacking the Black's King castle on h7. 
c) playing Be2 avoiding any exchange."

A very strange move. With this move White have trapped his black bishop. Also it's announcing that it's going to short castle. 
Be2 would had been a better place."

Also according to this kind of Sicilian Defense (Kan variation) it hurries to play in the big diagonal (a8-h1) with his white bishop.

92,3,15,Nxc2,b'r5k1/2pp2p1/8/p1bPp3/4P2r/P1N2P2/1Pn2RP1/R5K1 w - -',I like this move. I take a pawn and pin the rook to the king at the same time.
93,3,16,Bxf2+,b'r5k1/2pp2p1/8/p2Pp3/4P2r/P1N2P2/1Pn2bP1/5RK1 w - -',of course I take the rook
94,3,17,2Kxf2,b'r5k1/2pp2p1/8/p2Pp3/4P2r/P1N2P2/1Pn2KP1/5R2 b - -',Getting his king centralized for the endgame. 
95,3,18,2Rb8,b'1r4k1/2pp2p1/8/p2Pp3/4P2r/P1N2P2/1Pn2KP1/5R2 w - -',Attacking another pawn.
96,3,19,2Kg1,b'1r4k1/2pp2p1/8/p2Pp3/4P3/P1N2PP1/1Pn4r/5RK1 b - -',Okay why did he do that? I understand that he wants to attack my rook but I think it would have been better to centralize his king some more. On the other hand think way I can't take the pawn yet
97,3,20,c6,b'6k1/3p2p1/2p5/p2Pp3/4P3/P4PP1/1rnr4/1NR3K1 w - -',Why didn't I notice he was attacking the rook?!
98,3,21,3Nxd2,b'6k1/3p2p1/2p5/p2Pp3/4P3/P4PP1/1rnN4/2R3K1 b - -',And now I completely threw away my material lead.
99,3,22,3Rb1,b'6k1/3p2p1/8/p2pp3/4P3/P4PP1/1rnN4/1R4K1 b - -',Okay he should have taken back the pawn first.
100,3,23,3Rxb1+,b'6k1/3p2p1/8/p2pp3/4P3/P4PP1/2nN4/1r4K1 w - -',Why certainly I'll trade after all I am ahead by a pawn.
101,3,24,d3,b'6k1/3p2p1/8/p3p3/4P3/P2p1PP1/2nN4/6K1 w - -',I really should have taken his pawn.
102,3,25,3Nc4,b'6k1/3p2p1/8/p3p3/2N1P3/P2p1PP1/2n5/6K1 b - -',And now he defended it.
103,3,26,4Nd2,b'6k1/3p2p1/8/4p3/p3P3/P2p1PP1/2nN4/6K1 b - -',...only to move it back. I would probably taken on e5
104,3,27,4Kf2,b'8/3p1kp1/8/4p3/p3P3/P2p1PP1/2nN1K2/8 b - -',We both centralize our kings
105,3,28,4Nxa3,b'8/3p1kp1/8/4p3/p3P3/n2p1PP1/3N1K2/8 w - -',Finally I take his pawn
106,3,29,4Kxd3,b'8/3p1kp1/8/1n2p3/p3P3/3K1PP1/3N4/8 b - -',...And he takes my pawn. I now try to promote my passed pawn but with my kins so far away I fail.
107,3,30,4Kc3,b'8/3p1kp1/8/4p3/4P3/n1K2PP1/p7/N7 b - -',I think it was around this time that I offered a draw. He declined.
108,3,31,4Kb3,b'8/3p1k2/8/4p1p1/4P3/nK3PP1/p7/N7 b - -',And now I lose my passed pawn making the game equal again.
109,3,32,Kf6,b'8/3p4/5k2/1n2p1p1/4P3/5PP1/K7/N7 w - -',I advance my king
110,3,33,Nd4,b'8/3p4/4k3/4p1p1/3nP1P1/5P2/K1N5/8 w - -',Hoping for a knight trade after which my king could eat the white pawns as he is so much closer that his pale counterpart.
111,3,34,5Ne3,b'8/3p4/4k3/4p1p1/3nP1P1/4NP2/K7/8 b - -',Nope no such luck
112,3,35,5Nf5,b'8/8/3pk3/4pNp1/3nP1P1/5P2/K7/8 b - -',Here I offer another draw. He declines again. 
113,3,36,5Nxf3,b'8/8/3pk3/4pNp1/4P1P1/5n2/K7/8 w - -',I really should have taken his knight but the pawn was too tempting.
114,3,37,5Ng7+,b'8/6N1/3pk3/4p1p1/4P1P1/5n2/K7/8 b - -',Now follows some aimless knightplay until finally a draw by repetition.
115,3,38,Kf6,b'8/6N1/3p1k2/4p1p1/4P1P1/5n2/K7/8 w - -',And finally a draw! My question is could either side have done better than a draw?
116,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I almost always play this.
117,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',At this level this is the common response.
118,4,2,Nxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I didn't see any reason not to take the pawn so...
119,4,3,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Decided to poke my knight. Guess he didn't notice the fork
120,4,4,Qxe4+,b'r1b1kbnN/pppp2pp/5p2/8/2Bnq3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Forking my king and G pawn
121,4,5,Be2,b'r1b1kbnN/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3nq3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQq -',Seemed best to me. Although blocking with the queen might have been better.
122,4,6,Qxg2,b'r1b1kbnN/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3n4/8/PPPPBPqP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Expected that.
123,4,7,Rf1,b'r1b1kbnN/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3n4/8/PPPPBPqP/RNBQKR2 b Qq -',Had to be careful of smothered mate here if pins my bishop
124,4,8,Qxh2,b'r1b1kbnN/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3n4/8/PPPPBP1q/RNBQKR2 w Qq -',Nope. Just grabbing another pawn.

128,4,12,Qb4+,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb1pp/1p3p2/8/1q6/3PB3/PPP1QP2/R3KR2 w Qq -',Another fork between my king and a pawn.
129,4,13,Qxb2,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb1pp/1p3p2/8/8/3P4/PqPBQP2/R3KR2 w Qq -',What else?
130,4,14,1Qxh7,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb2Q/1p3pp1/8/8/3P4/PqPB1P2/R3KR2 b Qq -',I thought that if he took my rook I could checkmate him. I guess I didn't notice it would put me in check
131,4,15,1Ke2,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb2Q/1p3pp1/8/8/3P4/P1PBKP2/q4R2 b q -',Now the queen is attacked and I though he would have to either lose his queen or the game. But he noticed something...
132,4,16,1Qxg6+,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb3/1p3pQ1/8/8/3P4/q1PBKP2/5R2 b q -',Here I decided a draw was good enough and calculated that I could get perpetual check. If you notice something he could have done to get out of it please tell me.
133,4,17,2Nh8+,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppb3/1p3pQ1/8/8/3P4/q1PBKP2/5R2 b - -',Here he had to options. One led to perpetual check (I think) the other led to checkmate.
134,4,18,2Kf8,b'r1b2k1N/p1ppb3/1p3pQ1/8/8/3P4/q1PBKP2/5R2 w - -',Oops
135,4,19,2Bh6#,b'r1b2k1N/p1ppb3/1p3pQB/8/8/3P4/q1P1KP2/5R2 b - -',And a nice bishop checkmate to finish.
136,5,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I've never been impressed with the Sicilian Defense.  I realize it's the most popular response to 1. e4 but White doesn't have to head into the myriad of Black's homespun preparation and still get a fantastic game.
137,5,1,Qc7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppqppppp/8/3nP3/2Bp4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This move of the late Yugoslav IM Rabar is considered Black's strongest.  White gets at worst a promising gambit for the price of a pawn and if Black goes astray he can get crushed.
138,5,2,e6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4p3/3nP3/2Bp4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',6...Nb6 makes a lot more sense to me.
139,5,3,Nxd4,b'rnb1kb1r/p1qp1ppp/1p6/3pP3/3N4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',The game is still about even right now in my opinion.
140,5,4,Ba6,b'rn2kb1r/p1qp1ppp/bp6/3pP3/3N4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This is what I expected.  The Bishop on b7 would turn out to be a dud.  However I don't think Black had any idea what my next move was going to be.
141,5,5,1Nb5,b'rn2kb1r/p1qp1ppp/bp6/1N1pP3/8/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Black should take the Knight here.  But one never knows...
142,5,6,1Re2,b'rn2k2r/p2pbppp/1p6/1Q1p3q/8/2P5/PP2RPPP/RNBK4 b kq -',In my humble opinion the game is dead even.  Black's extra pawn is very weak and will fall at some point in the game so I'm not even counting it as a material advantage.
143,5,7,b5,b'2r2rk1/p2pbppp/2n5/1p1Q4/2N5/2P2P2/PPK1R1P1/R1B3q1 w - -',

145,6,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',here I get the feeling he's going for something like a fools mate or get his knight to fork the queen/rook playing at GK made me more aware of this and am always suspicious after this move
146,6,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I continue normal just getting my pieces out

148,6,4,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',just taking out more pieces while he is taking out his pawns was still confused but now I realise he might have tried to build a pawn wall

167,6,23,Rxf8,b'5rk1/5ppp/5n2/pq1P4/1p2P3/2pP3P/P4PP1/2RQR1K1 w - -',I think this mistake was the fatal one you will see why
168,6,24,2Qb3,b'5rk1/5ppp/5n2/pq1P4/1p2P3/1QpP3P/P4PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',he touched his queen to early here and was forced to move it imo he could have just left it there im not realy uptight about it but he tought differently

175,7,1,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',I opt for a Maróczy Bind which takes control of the d5 square and pretty much prevents the d7-d5 move that black hopes for in the Accelerated Dragon.
176,7,2,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This all seems normal up to now.
177,7,3,Nh5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p2p1/7n/2PBP3/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I do not think this was a wise move trading the g7 bishop with that kind of pawn formation can be detrimental to king safety.
178,7,4,1Kh1,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppnp/3p2p1/8/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',I guess I did this to prevent any surprise forks/double attacks with check maybe I was thinking of a possible pawn storm.

183,7,9,Qh4,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2bpp1pQ/5P1n/2P4q/2NR1P2/PP2B1PP/R6K w - -',I guess Nh5 was to prepare this move.
184,7,10,1Kg1,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2bpp1pQ/5P1n/2P4q/2NR1P2/PP2B1PP/R5K1 b - -',Preventing a discovered attack which would end up in the loss of my queen.
185,7,11,2Rxd6,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2bR2pQ/5p1n/2P4q/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R5K1 b - -',And I'm a pawn ahead. I like my position to be honest. A pawn ahead my rook is on an open (central) file my queen is on an aggressive square and my king is safe.
186,7,12,2Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pp5p/2bR2pQ/5p1n/2P4q/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R5K1 w - -',Offers the rook for control of the file. Here I have several options. I can retreat my queen to d2 I can place my other rook on the same file and put some use to it and I can trade rooks in order to simplify since I'm ahead in material. I like retreating my queen to d2 or placing the other rook on the same file the best. Trading rooks here might seem to favor the side that's ahead on material but I think that giving him that open file might be a bad idea.
187,7,13,2c5,b'3r1rk1/pp5p/2bR2pQ/2P2p1n/7q/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R5K1 b - -',So I chose c5. Let me explain. I defend my rook while at the same time opening the possibility for my e2 bishop to check his king and put him in a precarious position. What I failed to notice is that I cannot actually check his king since his queen would take my bishop and that I've just given the pawn back due to a tactic. But if he took the pawn back I'd be able to get my bishop where I had planned.
188,7,14,Qd4+,b'5rk1/pp5p/2bP2pQ/5p1n/3q4/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R5K1 w - -',And here's the tactic.

190,7,16,2Re1,b'5r1k/pp5p/2bq2pQ/5p1n/2B5/2N2P2/PP4PP/4RK2 b - -',I did this to try to place my rook on e6 after and possibly distract the queen from it's defence of f8.
191,7,17,2Qc5,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/2q2p1n/2B5/2N2P2/PP4PP/4RK2 w - -',He attacks my bishop.
192,7,18,2Bb3,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/2q2p1n/8/1BN2P2/PP4PP/4RK2 b - -',I retreat to a safe square.
193,7,19,2f4,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/2q4n/5p2/1BN2P2/PP4PP/4RK2 w - -',This is a blunder. How do I capitalize?
194,7,20,2Re5,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/2q1R2n/5p2/1BN2P2/PP4PP/5K2 b - -',There we go. He can't take the rook because he'd get mated in 1 by way of Qxf8 so now he must move to a square where he defends the rook on f8. There's only two options. Qd6 and Qb4.
195,7,21,2Qd6,b'5r1k/pp5p/2bq2pQ/4R2n/5p2/1BN2P2/PP4PP/5K2 w - -',He chose Qd6.
196,7,22,2Ne4,b'5r1k/pp5p/2bq2pQ/4R2n/4Np2/1B3P2/PP4PP/5K2 b - -',And I chose to blunder right back with the idea of sending my knight to g5 afterwards and attacking his king. The problem is that I had a move that would win a piece attack his king and kept my king pretty safe. I should have followed up the first brilliant tactic with another brilliant tactic. I should have played 28. Rxh5. The g pawn was pinned to the queen so he couldn't take the rook unless he wanted to lose the queen. And his queen was defending the f8 rook so even if he checked me he would have had to find a way for him to defend both the mate on h7 and the mate on Qxf8 after the check and even if he could I would be a piece ahead. I think 28. Rxh5 would have won instantly.
197,7,23,2Qd3+,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/4R2n/4Np2/1B1q1P2/PP4PP/5K2 w - -',And now will follow a myriad of checks until he wins a pawn and gets tired of checking my king.
198,7,24,Qxb2+,b'5r1k/pp5p/2b3pQ/4R2n/4Np2/1B3P2/Pq3KPP/8 w - -',Wins the pawn and now is a pawn up.
199,7,25,Rd8,b'3r3k/pp5p/2b3pQ/4R2n/4Np2/1B1q1P2/P5PP/4K3 w - -',And now I do not like my king safety. 
200,7,26,3Rxh5,b'3r3k/pp5p/2b3pQ/7R/4Np2/1B1q1P2/P5PP/4K3 b - -',I looked at this move a bit too late and a bit erroneously as well. I thought he couldn't take the rook because of Qf6# but he surprised me with another check which defended the f6 square and allowed him to win the exchange.
201,7,27,gxh5,b'3r3k/pp5p/2b4Q/7p/4Np2/1B3P2/Pq4PP/4K3 w - -',This was starting to look quite grim for me.
202,7,28,3Qxf4,b'3r3k/pp5p/2b5/7p/4NQ2/1B3P2/Pq4PP/4K3 b - -',I take the f pawn since doubled pawns are easier to attack. I was thinking that I could still pull a victory out somehow but the next move was pretty forcing.
203,7,29,3Qf6+,b'3r3k/pp5p/5Q2/1b5p/4N3/1B3P2/Pq4PP/4K3 b - -',I believe I was forced to do this or else I'd lose a lot of material or get checkmated or get into a really uncomfortable position after 39. Qe3. So I chose to trade queens hoping that his doubled pawns on the h file will be a target and I'll find a way to draw the game.
204,7,30,h4,b'3r3k/pp5p/5N2/1b6/7p/1B3P2/P5PP/4K3 w - -',Protects his pawn.
205,7,31,4Ne4,b'3r3k/pp5p/8/1b6/4N2p/1B3P2/P5PP/4K3 b - -',I was planning some weird knight moves to win the h4 pawn. Maybe I should have focused more on advancing my kingside pawn majority.
206,7,32,4a5,b'3r3k/1p5p/8/pb6/4N2p/1B3P2/P5PP/4K3 w - a6',Now he began to get his queenside pawns rolling.
207,7,33,4Nc3,b'3r3k/1p5p/8/pb6/7p/1BN2P2/P5PP/4K3 b - -',Attacking the bishop. Only 3 more knight moves away from attacking the h4 pawn. Might have been a bit too hopeful for that. Forgetting that his queenside pawn majority could be my downfall.

209,7,35,4a3,b'3r3k/7p/2b5/pp6/7p/PBN2P2/4K1PP/8 b - -',I'm not sure that this was the right way to proceed. Maybe I could have played a4. Suggestions?
210,7,36,4Ke1,b'3r3k/7p/8/1b6/1p2N2p/1B3P2/6PP/4K3 b - -',I can't go up as I'd like to because of Rd3+ winning my bishop and the game.
211,7,37,4Rd3,b'7k/7p/8/1b6/1p2N2p/1B1r1P2/6PP/4K3 w - -',He goes to d3 anyway only in this case I don't lose a piece.
212,7,38,Ra3,b'7k/7p/8/1b6/1p2N2p/r4P2/2B3PP/4K3 w - -',Preparing an advance to b3.
213,7,39,4Nd2,b'7k/7p/8/1b6/1p5p/r4P2/2BN2PP/4K3 b - -',Preventing the immediate advance.
214,7,40,4Kg7,b'8/6kp/8/1b6/1p5p/r4P2/2BN2PP/4K3 w - -',Finally bringing his king out of inactivity.
215,7,41,5Nb1,b'8/6kp/8/1b6/1p5p/r4P2/2B3PP/1N2K3 b - -',Perhaps I should have tried g3 here. This move allows the advance of the pawn after a useful check on e3.
216,7,42,5Kd1,b'8/6kp/8/1b6/1p5p/4rP2/2B3PP/1N1K4 b - -',If Kf2 I lose a piece if Kd2 I lose the g pawn.
217,7,43,5Be4,b'8/6kp/8/1b6/4B2p/1p2rP2/6PP/1N1K4 b - -',Saving the bishop and limiting the rook's movement.
218,7,44,5h6,b'8/6k1/7p/1b6/4B2p/1p2rP2/6PP/1N1K4 w - -',I suppose he wanted to move his king without losing that pawn.
219,7,45,5g3,b'8/6k1/7p/1b6/4B2p/1p2rPP1/7P/1N1K4 b - -',I finally play g3 not sure if it was too late.
220,7,46,Kf6,b'8/8/5k1p/1b6/4B3/1p2rPP1/8/1N1K4 w - -',His king is getting closer.
221,7,47,6Ke3,b'8/8/5k1p/8/2b1B3/1pN1KPP1/8/r7 b - -',Trying to get my king involved somehow.
222,7,48,6Bb1,b'8/8/5k1p/8/2b5/2N1KPP1/1p6/rB6 b - -',And this is the final decisive blunder. Try to find the next move for black. I should have played Kd2 but maybe that would have lost as well.
223,7,49,Rxb1,b'8/8/5k1p/8/8/4KPP1/8/1r6 w - -',And here it is clear that I cannot win.
224,7,50,6f4,b'8/8/5k1p/8/5P2/4K1P1/8/1r6 b - -',The next few moves I played quickly and without much thought.
225,7,51,6Kg2,b'8/8/7p/5k2/5P2/1r4P1/6K1/8 b - -',And I surrendered. His king was going to g4 next winning my final two pawns and relinquishing all my hopes.
226,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! I'm coming to you today with a very special game--for me anyway. This game pushed me across the 1800 mark for the first time! I think the play itself is interesting enough to be worth a look as well. I get an advantage relatively early on and then on move 18 I make a choice that gives the game its very unique flavor. Enjoy!
227,8,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',l-d-j chooses the Center Counter Defense--old but good.
228,8,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Personally I like this line more than the classical 2...Qxd5. This is the Marshall Gambit where White may be able to hold on to his extra pawn if he so chooses.
229,8,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I stick to the main line though. If Black takes on d5 I'll play c2-c4 and counterattack while gaining space.
230,8,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Unusual! It seems that White can very solidly hold on to the d5 pawn now with 4.f3 Bf5 5.Bb5+ Nbd7 6.c4 though the White Kingside will be cramped and he may find his light-squared Bishop awkwardly placed later on.
231,8,5,Nf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I decide to begin development and keep my center open instead letting Black regain his pawn. I can still follow up with c2-c4 after all.
232,8,6,Be2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Momentarily responding to the threat on my Knight. No sense in allowing Black to mess up my kingside pawns by trading on f3. Of course the immediate 5.c2-c4 was playable here.
233,8,7,Nc6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Already the position is very interesting; Black now threatens to win my pawn on d4 with ...Bxf3 Bxf3 Qxd4. **EDIT: This is actually not true; thanks to theduckquacker for catching it!
234,8,8,c4,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',Time to kick the BQ off her comfy central perch.
235,8,9,Qf5,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black maintains a centralized Queen and pressure on both f3 and c2.
236,8,10,Be3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/4BN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',O-O-O is coming and I don't want to have to worry about the defense of the d-pawn.
237,8,11,e5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4pq2/2PP2b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ e6',Black makes his freeing break also threatening to jump down to b4 with his Bishop. White needs to get his King out of the center and activate his heavy pieces.
238,8,12,d5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Ppq2/2P3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',But first this natural move is pretty strong. It kicks the Knight out of c6 and exposes a threat on the a7 pawn (but of course White can't simply win the pawn because of Black's equally-natural response...)
239,8,13,Nb4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',With the threat of ...Nc2+ thanks to the Queen.
240,8,14,1Rc1,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/2RQK2R b K -',10.O-O was also an option here but I like the open file this line gets me against the Black King's position.
241,8,15,Nb4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/1P1NBPPP/R2QK2R w K -',Right back where we were but now the a-file is half-opened for the White Rook at the cost of a pawn.
242,8,16,a6,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/1P1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Of course the only reasonable way to prevent the loss of the pawn.
243,8,17,1h3,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN1P/1P1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White needs to release some of the pressure on the kingside before he can pursue a queenside assault. This actually sets up a rather interesting option for Black: 13...h5?! where 14.hxg4 hxg4 gives Black a strong attack down the h-file. My opponent confided that he'd considered this line but ultimately discarded it as White is not compelled to play hxg4 immediately.
244,8,18,1Nxf3,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP5/4BN1P/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Of course 14.Bxf3 was tempting in order to set up an attempt to play Bg4 but the text is stronger getting the Knight into the game and unblocking White's lines. Here the computer recommends 14...Bd6 to pressure the White kingside evaluating the position as just about even with big attacks on both sides.
245,8,19,1Nc2,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/2P5/4BN1P/1Pn1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? A terrible misstep. Black intends to force White to give up his dark-squared Bishop and weaken his kingside squares further (after for example 15.Ra5 Nxe3 16.fxe3) but it's all moot as White has a crushing fork at his disposal now that the White Queen's scope extends to d3...
246,8,20,1Bd3,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/2P5/3BBN1P/1Pn2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And as quickly as that White has a huge advantage. Of course 15...Nxe3 won't work because 16.Bxf5+ Nxf5 leaves Black with only two Bishops for his Queen and little counterplay.
247,8,21,1e4,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3P1q2/2P1p3/3BBN1P/1Pn2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is best I think though of course the pawn fork is a sham as the pawn is still pinned to the BQ.
248,8,22,Bd6,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2b1n2/3P1q2/2P1p3/4BN1P/1PB2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black has to get all his forces into action immediately if he wants any chance to survive so he develops the Bishop and prepares for Rook movement to the center as well.
249,8,23,1Qd4,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2b1n2/3P1q2/2PQp3/4BN1P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',White centralizes his Queen with a powerful thrust threatening to jump into the Black castle while pressuring e4 and g7.
250,8,24,1c5,b'2kr3r/1p3ppp/p2b1n2/2pP1q2/2PQp3/4BN1P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 w - c6',Giving White a passed pawn but shutting down the White Queen's diagonal and giving her a kick. I fretted about my next move here for quite some time--transition to the queenside with Qc3 or Qd2? Give back some material for a counterattack play (18.Bxe4?! Nxe4 19.Qxg7 or 18...Qxe4 19.Qxe4 Nxe4 20.Ra5) and rely on my passed d-pawn to win?
251,8,25,1dxc6e.p.,b'2kr3r/1p3ppp/p1Pb1n2/5q2/2PQp3/4BN1P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',!? Black has a nice combination available here set up by his previous two moves. After analyzing it I felt like I'd still be able to force a win and the main result of the combination is to remove a lot of material from the board: an outcome I was perfectly okay with being ahead by a full piece. There may well have been a more accurate move here but I don't know what it was.
252,8,26,1Bh2+,b'2kr3r/1p3ppp/p1P2n2/5q2/2PQp3/4BN1P/1PB2PPb/R4RK1 w - -',Unleashing the discovered attack against the White Queen. 
253,8,27,2Kg1,b'2k4r/1p3ppp/p1P2n2/4q3/2PNp3/4B2P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',The dust has settled and White has a Rook Bishop and pawn in exchange for his Queen as well as his extra Bishop. It should be enough to win but he'll still have to coordinate all his minor pieces while avoiding a mate from the remaining Black heavy forces.
254,8,28,2g5,b'2k4r/1p3p1p/p1P2n2/4q1p1/2PNp3/4B2P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 w - g6',Black immediately marches on g4 attempting to free it for a Knight to occupy. I think 21...Rd8 looks playable as well as this Rook doesn't have many prospects on the kingside right now and Black needs every piece to be operating at full force.
255,8,29,2cxb7+,b'2k4r/1P3p1p/p4n2/4q1p1/2PNp3/4B2P/1PB2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Logical bringing the Black King to where White can theoretically check him with Bxe4. The main draw of this move of course is removing obstacles to the White c4 pawn on its road to promotion.
256,8,30,2b4,b'7r/1k3p1p/p4n2/4q1p1/1PPNp3/4B2P/2B2PP1/R4RK1 b - b3',Preparing for Ra5 followed by Rfa1.
257,8,31,2g4,b'7r/1k3p1p/p4n2/4q3/1PPNp1p1/4B2P/2B2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',I just don't think Black has time to make this attack effective. His Rook is still out of the picture.
258,8,32,Qd6,b'7r/1k3p1p/p2q1n2/R7/1PPNp1p1/4B2P/2B2PP1/5RK1 w - -',Attempting to remain on the b8-h2 diagonal. The problem is Black simply doesn't have the resources to defend everything that needs defending.
259,8,33,2hxg4,b'7r/1k3p1p/p2q1n2/R7/1PPNp1P1/4B3/2B2PP1/5RK1 b - -',I'm not sure if this is best but I don't see anything obviously better. 25.c5 was my other main consideration. The goal of the text is of course to bring my LSB into the battle with check after drawing away the Knight and win a pawn in the process.
260,8,34,Kb8,b'1k5r/5p1p/p2q4/R7/1PPNB1n1/4B3/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',White must of course be supremely careful as Black is threatening instant mate on h2. But there is a swarm of minor pieces descending on the Black King...
261,8,35,2Nc6+,b'1k5r/5p1p/p1Nq4/R7/1PP1B1n1/4B3/5PP1/5RK1 b - -',White's goal is now to clean up the Black attack so that he can recoordinate and execute a mate. The plan starts by forcing the exposed Black King to submit to a fork or a discovered attack losing material in the process. With correct play by White it's only a matter of time now.
262,8,36,2Kc7,b'7r/2k2p1p/p1Nq4/R7/1PP1B1n1/4B3/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',Or: 27...Kb7 28.Ne5+ or 27...Ka8 28.Ne5+ or 27...Kc8 28.Bf5+ (winning the Ng4 in all cases).
263,8,37,2Bb6+,b'7r/2k2p1p/pBNq4/R7/1PP1B1n1/8/5PP1/5RK1 b - -',! Forcing the BK onto one of the critical squares from which White can win further material. If 28...Kxb6? 29.c5+ wins the Queen.
264,8,38,h5,b'7r/1k3p2/pBNq4/R6p/1PP3B1/8/5PP1/5RK1 w - h6',There's really nothing better for Black at this point. Death will come swiftly.
265,8,39,3Ne7+,b'7r/1k2Np2/pB6/R6p/1PP2q2/5B2/5PP1/5RK1 b - -',Keeping the King in his corner.
266,8,40,3Ra8#,b'Rk5r/4Np2/1B6/8/1PP2q1p/5B2/5PP1/5RK1 b - -',And that's all there is! Many thanks to l-d-j for a very enjoyable game. Comments are always appreciated! Thanks for reading!

274,9,7,e4,b'4r2k/1q2b1p1/r2p1n1p/2p5/P1P1p3/R3BPPP/1PQNP3/5RK1 w - -',I'm just winging it at this point.  I have no idea what to do.
275,10,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Before the game gets completely underway I would like to compliment my opponent for two things.  First he chose an obscure opening that isn't well analyzed. This in and of itself isn't particularly striking.  However it offered attacking chances and in places it could get tricky.  And second he has a strong tactical sense that I'm sure has served him well over his chess career.  I enjoyed this game very much.
276,10,1,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This move is great in blitz but considering the fact that I have two days to consider each of my moves it's a poor choice.
277,10,2,Qxf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I personally would have considered Nxf3 here.  The pawn is bait but it isn't poison.
278,10,3,Be3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3q4/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',White uses Black's exposed Queen to gain time and a lead in development.
279,10,4,O-O-O,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/6q1/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/2KR1BNR b kq -',This move while normal and good in many cases isn't good here because it allows me to swap-off Queens which I think could be used in an attack down the road.
280,10,5,Nxf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',"White has a massive lead in development.  In fact if I were to pass a board that had this position in a chess tournament I would probably say off the top of my head ""I'd rather be White here.""  "
281,10,6,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/8/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',Black cannot allow Nb5.
282,10,7,e6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w kq -',White might sac on f7 and put massive pressure down the f-file.
283,10,8,1Ng5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B5/2N1B3/PPP3PP/2KR1R2 b kq -',The pressure continues.  All of these moves go with the theme of the opening.
284,10,9,1Bd3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6N1/8/2NBB3/PPP3PP/2KR1R2 b kq -',Another good move putting the Bishop on a good diagonal.

287,10,12,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3B3P/2NB1N2/PPP3P1/2KRR3 w - -',Even though this is a win for Black it isn't automatic.  Black still has to complete his development and choose his moves carefully.  White must realize that he needs to generate a genuine attack if he's going to accomplish anything with his lead in development.
288,10,13,Bb7,b'r2r2k1/pb1nbpp1/1pp1pn1p/8/4N2P/3B1N2/PPP2BP1/2KRR3 w - -',There's no need to take the Knight leaving White's development 5 to 3.  If White wants to trade the Knight let him do so with the development issue at 5 to 4.  Besides trading-off pieces when one is down in material and no sure fire winning opportunity only helps Black.

I think he should reconsider his feelings and keep it around for when he's playing under fast time controls."
292,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I decided to analyze one of my loses especially because my opponent found a beautiful way to end the game.

294,11,2,Qc7,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',We are stilling following the well-known theory.
295,11,3,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',This is first time I deviate from the theory. 9. Nbd7 is the most played move here. 9. O-O is probably not that good although I found out that even Bobby Fischer played this once (Unzicker-Fischer Buenos Aires 1960) but lost that game.
296,11,4,Rd8,b'rnbr2k1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N3Q1/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',And now we are definitely out of the book. As shown later in the game the rook does not belong here. But I was worried that White plays Bh6 at some point and I wanted to be able to play Bf8 for defence and possibly Ne8 if necessary. However especially with opposite side castling concrete lines are more important than vague ideas.
297,11,5,1Kb1,b'rnbr2k1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N3Q1/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R b - -',I sensible move. The king is probably safer at b1.

I was calculating what happens after White plays 14. e5. Then White can play Bxb7 in many lines attacking the rook and basically forcing the recapture with the queen. I did not like the queen on b7. Now the rook can capture the bishop. But the other side of the coin is that the rooks are not easily connected which leaves the d8-rook a little vulnerable and the b5-square is an obvious square for a knight fork if White can make it work tactically.
303,11,11,1Rhe1,b'1n1r2k1/rbq1bppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2N2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - -',Now White is fully developed and ready to act.

310,11,18,1Bxf6,b'1n1r2k1/rbq2ppp/p3pb2/4P3/3N4/2p2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 w - -',This is a mistake although at that point it seemed like a logical choice because I still expected 18. exf6 Qxg3 19. hxg3 and a nice endgame.
311,11,19,1Nb5,b'1n1r2k1/rbq2ppp/p3pb2/1N2P3/8/2p2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - -',This is the blow that ends the game. I just stared at the board for a while and slowly I began to see that I was completely lost. White did not take back the piece but offers an other one. But 18...axb5 19. exf6 threatening both the queen and a checkmate on g7 wins because 19...Qxg3 is followed by 20. Rxd8#. A counter-threat like 17...Qb6 is just not enough: 18. exf6 g6 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Nxa7 and White can probably even save the knight because the knight on b8 is only protected by the queen. I did not like losing a rook so I decided to give White a chance to go wrong.

White can't recapture with the e pawn in this position without losing her f pawn. This means White will either recapture with her c pawn or her knight. Taking the pawn with the knight seems a bad idea as there will be 1 less defender of the e5 square an important square in this opening.

369,13,15,1dxe5,b'2rqnrk1/pp1bnp1p/4p1pQ/3pP1P1/5P2/P3P3/1P1N3P/RBB2RK1 b - -',This came as a surprise to me. I was pretty sure that White would recapture with her f pawn opening the f file for her rook and more importantly NOT removing a blocker of the g1-a7 diagonal. 
370,13,16,1Ng7,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bnpnp/4p1pQ/3pP1P1/5P2/P3P3/1P1N3P/RBB2RK1 w - -',Just as planned.

Now that that the mating threats are off White's bishop is off the a6-f1 diagonal and my knight no longer blocks my bishop I can play 18.Bb5! attacking the rook. That rook is currently the only piece defending the c1 bishop form my rook so it cant move off the first rank.
373,13,19,1Re1,b'2rq1rk1/pp2npnp/4p1p1/1b1pP1P1/5P1Q/P3P3/1P1N3P/RBB1R1K1 b - -',A mistake would be 19.Rf3 (Sacrificing the bishop so her rook would go on h3 faster threatening mate) Rxc1+ 20.Kg2 Nef5 21.Bxe5 (Discovered attack on the rook) fails to Nxf5 attacking the queen and the a1 rooks falls afterwards. 19.Re1 moves the rook away from danger and protects the e pawn but it has lost the option to come down to h3 attacking my king. This means my king is now perfectly safe.
374,13,20,1Qb6,b'2r2rk1/pp2npnp/1q2p1p1/1b1pP1P1/5P1Q/P3P3/1P1N3P/RBB1R1K1 w - -',Now I move my queen to a powerful position; I pin White's e pawn to her king while eyeing for her b pawn after my bishop moves.
375,13,21,2Nb3,b'2r2rk1/pp2npnp/1q2p1p1/1b1pP1P1/5P1Q/PN2P3/1P5P/RBB1R1K1 b - -',?! A risky move. White probably wants to post her knight on d4 but overlooks my next move.
376,13,22,2Ngf5,b'2r2rk1/pp2np1p/1q2p1p1/1b1pPnP1/5P1Q/PN2P3/1P5P/RBB1R1K1 w - -',I attack her queen and her weak e pawn. I also cover the d4 square so that White should not place her knight there.
377,13,23,2Qh3,b'2r2rk1/pp2np1p/1q2p1p1/1b1pPnP1/5P2/PN2P2Q/1P5P/RBB1R1K1 b - -',? Much more active (and better) was 21.Qf7. 21.Bxf5 is not a good option either as my other knight simply recaptures the bishop and the c2 square becomes all mine.
378,13,24,2Ba4,b'2r2rk1/pp2np1p/1q2p1p1/3pPnP1/b4P2/PN2P2Q/1P5P/RBB1R1K1 w - -',I attack the knight twice and it is currently undefended. The knight must move away barring some sort of crazy sacrifice that I didn't see in the current position.

Qxd2 (24...Nxf5 25.Nf1) 25.Bg4 leaves me down 1 point in material. 22...Rxc1 23.Rxc1 Nxe3 24.Kh1 leaves me down in material but then I missed the following 24...Nd1! (Threatening a royal fork on f2) with a certain advantage for me. However 22...Rc7 is not a game-losing blunder; I simply planned to double my rooks on the c file.
381,13,27,2Nf3,b'5rk1/ppr1np1p/1q2p1p1/3pPnP1/b4P2/P3PN1Q/1P5P/RBB1R1K1 b - -',?? This is White's losing move.

White's knight is now on f3 instead of d2. What does it change? The queen is no longer protecting the e pawn. How can I make use of this? Simple; with a double removal of the guard. 24.Rxc1 Qxe3+ 25.Kg2 (the others options lead to the same move but with check.) Qxc1 26.Bxf5? Qxb2 and every possible move for White leads to a piece capture with check. Ouch. Alternately 24.Bxf5 Rxa1! wins at least the e pawn in addition to the bishop. 24.Qf1 leads to the capture of the e pawn resulting in Black having at least a 4 point advantage in material anyway. White resigned. 0-1

If he castles queenside I don't even remember what I thought of doing if he castled queenside but right now I think I could have pawn stormed my way to his king.

Now my f pawn is free and can attack the knight plus I am already threatening to win the knight since 13... Bxc4 Rxe4 loses the queen 13... Nxd2 loses the queen and any moves other than 13... f5 13... Nf6 lose the knight immediately since the d5 bishop should not take whichever piece captures on e4 for it is pinned by the c4 bishop to his queen.

Place the King or leave it where it may be checked to move to a better position and in the meantime use the other pieces and pawns to gain position. This very strategy is employed by the White's King's Gambit--the King is not protected while an onslaught of White is moving to kill the weak Ruy Lopez! I use it all the time against the weak Ruy Lopez.

567,17,98,5Nd7,b'8/2rnq2k/1R6/7p/1b1P1P1P/3R2P1/7B/6K1 w - -',Black has to reassure White the game is over. 
568,17,99,5Rb5,b'8/2rnq2k/8/1R5p/1b1P1P1P/3R2P1/7B/6K1 b - -',A hail mary move that won't change a thing unless Black blunders.

664,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

After my loss against Etienne (A-Random-Guy) Coach Ion's kind remarks on Etienne's and my summing up about when to switch from attack to defense if an attack runs out of steam certainly rings true in this particular game.  One thing is for sure when mounting a mating attack Glenda cannot do this on her own despite the powers she has been given.  She needs assistance.  Another example of this is my Latvian game with Coach Ion many moons ago when although Glenda on her own managed to net a rook in Ion's pos that was all she got and because of the concentration of force that Ion's queen together with other pieces Henry ended up getting chased around - Glenda who remained on h1 for the rest of the game never even got the chance to hit back - and eventually I resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  Later on Glenda did eventually end that losing streak against Ion with a perpetual - but the emphasis is GLENDA NEEDS ASSISTANCE!  In that game Glenda had assistance from Fou Lenoir and that made all the difference.

Now in this game Glenda tries to attack on her own but to no effect.  She ends up being shut off from the action and Henry ends up castling into it.  Ken my opponent then exploits that mistake by launching a powerful mating attack on Henry.  Fortunately for me an untimely bishop check on Ken's part leads to Henry escaping to the kingside and Ken's attack runs out of steam and he eventually ends up losing both his rook and bishop and resigning on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So how does this happen?  Well let's start at the beginning.  After a double king pawn opening I end up playing against the Philidor's Defense which is as ......."
665,20,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. ...... d6 - .... follows.  This opening was explored by Andre Dancan Philidor and it is a playable opening although black can get cramped up big time.
666,20,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bc4 - sometimes d4 is played and I have played it but here I thought Bc4 would make a nice change.  It does strike at f7 and once black castles the f7 pawn will be pinned.  This can get exploited later on.
667,20,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',4. ...... Bg4 - this move is good here.  If I had played d4 before this move then it would not have been good.  To see why you will need to google up the Opera Game between Paul Morphy against The Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard in consultation - these noble dudes copped Old Matey on Move 17.  Hmm maybe d4 might have still been playable here although Glenda will be chased around a bit on the recapture by Nc6.
668,20,4,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',5. h3 - stab.
669,20,5,Bh5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p2b/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',6. ...... Bh5 - retreat.
670,20,6,g4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p2b/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq g3',7. g4 - this move tries to trap Ken's lsb.  I end up weakening the kingside however and it is this that will dissuade me from moving Henry there later on.
671,20,7,hxg6,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2pp1np1/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NP3P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',9. ..... hxg6 - this knight trade seemed a good idea at the time but it does further weaken my kingside and opens up a line for a black rook.  This influences Ken's correct decision to leave his king in the centre rather than castle.
672,20,8,cxd5,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/5np1/3pp3/2B3P1/2NP3P/PPPB1P2/R2QK2R w KQkq -',11. ..... cxd5 - pawn trade and now Fou Leblanc must take evasive action.  He moves to b3 but would b5 have been an improvement?  You the Inquest Jury decide.
673,20,9,1dxe4,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/6p1/4p3/3pP1P1/1B5P/PPPB1P2/R2QK2R b KQkq -',14. dxe4 - after this trade of knights Ken has a very strong pawn centre.  That d4 pawn was to very nearly win the game for Ken later on.
674,20,10,f6,b'r2qk2r/pp2b1p1/2n2pp1/4p3/3pP1P1/1B3Q1P/PPPB1P2/R3K2R w KQkq -',15. ..... f6 - this move is good here.  Ken supports his powerful pawn centre.  However he plays g5 next move and it is this that entices Glenda up the board to attack as a lone wolf.  This attack will prove premature as black has locked up the position so it will be very difficult for Glenda to get assistance and she could also end up being cut off from Henry just when he needs her most.
675,20,11,gxf6,b'r3k2r/pp2b3/2nq1pp1/4p3/3pP3/1B3Q1P/PPPB1P2/R3K2R w KQkq -',17. .... gxf6 - after this pawn trade Glenda is attracted upwards like ......

678,20,14,2Qg6+,b'1r2k2r/4b3/2nq1pQ1/pp1Bp1p1/3pP3/7P/PPPB1P2/2KR3R b k -',22. Qd6+ - further on and further up!

680,20,16,Kd7,b'1r5r/3kb3/2q2pQ1/Bp2p1p1/3pP3/7P/PPP2P2/2KR3R w - -',24. ..... Kd7 - I win a pawn but have I made Henry's position even more vulnerable?  Only time will tell.

682,20,18,2Rbc8,b'2r4r/3kb3/2q2pQ1/1p2p1p1/3pP3/7P/PPP2P2/2KRB2R w - -',25. ...... Rbc8 - suddenly a dark dark shadow appears over Henry and he starts shivering despite his pawn cover.  He looks up to see the Chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey weaving his scythe at him.  Not a pretty sight.  I end up letting my clock run down to less than 3 days per move before I finally defend with 26. c3.
683,20,19,2Qf5+,b'2r4r/4b3/2q1kp2/1p2pQp1/3pP3/2P4P/PP3P2/2KRB2R b - -',27. Qf5+ - Glenda gets a check in.  She is heading for f3 to add to the defense of c3.  I move comparatively quickly to build up some time on my clock to think about just how I can get Henry out of this mess and boy I need all the time I can get because I am very short on ideas here.
684,20,20,b4,b'2r4r/4bk2/2q2p2/4p1p1/1p1pP3/2P2Q1P/PP3P2/2KRB2R w - -',28. ..... b4 - nasty!

686,20,22,3bxc3,b'2r4r/4bk2/2q2p2/4p1p1/3pP3/2PR1Q1P/P4P2/2K1B2R b - -',30. bxc3 - this is real Hope Chess. I am praying that Ken cannot resist checking me.  If he plays Qa4 this will cut off Henry's escape to d1 and if I put Henry on d2 then PxP+ is really nasty!  I can just see my rating reading 1800 something a few days down the line!  Thankfully fate has decided that for now I keep that precious 1900 rating in the form of my opponent putting that bishop on a3!
687,20,23,Qa4+,b'2r4r/5k2/5p2/4p1p1/q2pP3/b1PR1Q1P/P4P2/3KB2R w - -',31. ..... Qa4+ - now the Wicked Witch of the West does move to a4 but e2 is at Henry's disposal for his deadly dash to the kingside!  Thankfully despite having to look at Old Matey's fiz for a few days or so he has worked up just enough appetite to eat prawns and spinach for lunch so he has enough power in his legs to do that runner!
688,20,24,3Rd2,b'2r4r/5k2/5p2/4p1p1/3pP3/b1P2Q1P/P1qRKP2/4B2R b - -',33. Rd2 - gotta preserve that passer on e2.

690,20,26,3Kf1,b'2r4r/5k2/5p2/4p1p1/3pP3/b2R1Q1P/Pq3P2/4BK1R b - -',35. Kf1 - Henry now makes safety and the pawn on a2 lives because Ken must do something about his bishop.  However he still presses for attack with Rc1 but I worked out that I can safely remove the bishop on h3 and still have time to put Henry on g2.  It is still not entirely safe but at least 2 out of the 3 of Ken's heavies are still on the other side of the board and I am now a piece up - this could prove decisive in the coming endgame.
691,20,27,3Qb3+,b'7r/1q3k2/5p2/4p1p1/3pP3/RQ5P/P4PK1/2r1B2R b - -',38. Qb3+ - and I now remove one of these heavies with check.  Even though Glenda perishes the Witch dies with her and I am a whole piece up with a potential comeback for Glenda on a8.
692,20,28,4a3,b'r7/5k2/5p2/4p1p1/3pP3/PR5P/5PK1/2r1B2R b - -',40. a3 - Ken attacks my passer but this is no problem.  I am planning Bb4 next move to back up that a pawn and either force an exchange of one pair of rooks or drive that black rook off my first rank and put my own rook on b1 if he chooses to retreat with the rook.  That will be a potential for a doubling up on the b column later on.  However Ken makes the final tragic blunder ...... Ke7?? 
693,20,29,4Bb4+,b'r7/4k3/5p2/4p1p1/1B1pP3/PR5P/5PK1/2r4R b - -',41. Bb4+ - this enables me to attack his rook on c1 with check and so I win it next move.  Afterwards Ken will be 8 points down in material and he decided that it would be far too much and resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Ken told me afterwards that he enjoyed the game immensely and it was one of the best he had played.  I heartily agree that he certainly gave me a big run for my money here and he can hold his head up high!  Anyhow as Yours Truly struggles to hold on to her 1900 rating there are two further games to come where I do manage a successful co-ordinated mating attack.  These are against opponents Friar and Jkarp.  Watch this space ......

The idea was to sacrifice the pawn's central advance in order to cause some problems to black. Now the point is white has the chance to recover the pawn via Qa4+ so currently black cannot go d4 due to cxd4 cxd4 Qa4+! and whatever black does white recovers the pawn. This also happens if white goes BxB. The queen must retake leaving the black diagonal guarding d4. Those are the two reasons black can't play d4 and crush me. 
Now it is clear that black is just preparing his castling seen that my developement is not quick or easy. The knight needs two moves to become an useful piece and I don't see a good future for it. On d2 it blocks the rook's action and white wants to have a rook on d1 stopping d4 even after the castling. But that means the knight has to develop to a3... an almost useless square in this position. So I considered: 
12. Rd1 o-o. And then?
12. f3 seemed interesting. We have to take into account that black missed Ng4! where my dsb must retire or be awfully exchanged. Based on the previous move black is not considering it... but hey at any moment black can change his mind and attack that way. So 12. f3 stops both knight's jumps (Ne4 is not really dangerous but...). It also prevents black to play BxB at some point (in some lines she has to or she will lose d4). It also prepares Bf2 and e4 a good plan for white not being squeezed and keep the pressure on c5 and avoiding d4.
All this sounds good but now seriously: you play to win not to defend. 
12. b4 could be a good way to proceed. I am not really threatening anything. Ne4 can't help black because of f3 but Rc8 that is a move surely on her agenda anyway. I don't want to help her to develop. And then? 
12. c4 may seem crazy but look: if black moves d4 BxB and black has to decide among QxB cxd cxd Bxd4 or d4xBd3 BxRa8 d3xf2+ Rxf2 c4!. But it is doubtful the attack will compensate the material loss. But anyway: Why should black move the pawn in d5? He has no reason to do it. If I take cxd5 her knight gets into the action so I won't do it. 

Now: look this funny line starting with an original idea: 
12. a4!?. 
It is based on the idea that I have a ""spare"" tempo. And I want to avoid to ""simply defend"". The advantage of the next a5 is that it threatens the queen so it blocks any black's action (except a check) and gives me more power on d4. If Qd6 Rd1 becomes attractive for white and b4 comes again into consideration. 
a5 blocks the square for the queen checks but still BxB is ""on"" against d4. But I didn't see it at once and analyzed the following: 

12.	a4		d4!? Just suppose. Of course black wouldn't play it but if he does and white overlooks the BxB line it goes: 
13.	a5		Qa6. If Qb5 14. Na3 becomes a developement move giving me an edge. If Qxa5 Nc4 is a freeway to e5 or a5... But this move gives white another chance:
14.	Qb3. You'd say it is futile since Rb8 followed by o-o is good f"

830,28,2,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I usually play this variation because it feels to me like the most natural place to put the bishop.
831,28,3,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',8. O-O is the most common move but I don't think it makes a big difference.

837,28,9,1Bd2,b'2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QRK1 b - -',I want to keep my bishop.
838,28,10,1Qb6+,b'2r2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq1pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QRK1 w - -',And Black takes control of the weakened g1-a7 diagonal. Although the Qb6-Ng4 setup looks dangerous it is not enough to create serious troubles for the king. Perhaps Black is little better here.
839,28,11,Ndf6,b'2r2rk1/1p2bppp/pq1pbn2/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K w - -',Black brings the knight to a more active square. The drawback is that the retreat square of the g4-knight is now occupied. I think this is a positional mistake that allows me to make progress.
840,28,12,1a5,b'2r2rk1/1p2bppp/pq1pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K b - -',The queen does not have any good squares on the g1-a7 diagonal. Either it has to give up the diagonal or go to a7.
841,28,13,1Qa7,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p2pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K w - -',And it goes to a7. This is probably the best alternative.
842,28,14,1Bd3,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p2pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - -',I was thinking about 16. f5 which was probably objectively best but for some reason I began to envision an attack where the bishop belonged to d3.
843,28,15,1d5,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3bn2/P2pp3/4PPn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - -',And Black just allows me to make my dreams true. Black could give his knight a good square by 16...exf4 17. Bxf4 Ne5.
844,28,16,1Nxd5,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3b3/P2Np3/5Pn1/1N1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - -',Another good move was 18. f5 with a complicated position.
845,28,17,1fxe5,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P2bP3/6n1/1N1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - -',But I preferred to keep it simple and just take the pawn. 
846,28,18,1Bxb3,b'2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P3P3/6n1/1b1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - -',This makes Blacks position even worse. He exchanges a perfectly good and active bishop for a knight that does not do much. Doubling the pawns is not an issue here because the activity of the bishop pair more than compensates for the stratural weakness.
847,28,19,Bc5,b'2r2rk1/qp3ppp/p7/P1b1P3/6n1/1P1B4/1P1B2PP/R3QR1K w - -',Black continues to play on the g1-a7 diagonal. However the threat of Nf2+ does not scare me as I can always sacrifice an exchange and there are no more threats on the king.
848,28,20,2Qh4,b'2r2rk1/qp3ppp/p7/P1b1P3/6nQ/1P1B4/1P1B2PP/R4R1K b - -',Or 21. Qe4. And Black resigns. Why? For example 21...Nf2+ 22. Rxf2! And Black cannot take back because of the checkmate on h7. Or 21...f5 22. exf6 e.p. Nxf6 (22...g6 23. Qxg4) 23. Rxf6! Rxf6 24. Qxh7+ with a decisive attack. Or 21...g6 and simply 22. Qxg4. Or 21...Nh6 22. Bxh6 gxh6 23. Qg4+ Kh8 24. Qf5 and 25. Qxh7#. There is no defence.

860,29,11,Rxe3,b'6k1/5pp1/1p5p/p7/3Q1P2/PP2r1PP/4q3/2R3K1 w - -',White resigned.  He has only Rc8+ and then when Black moves his Queen to safety White has nothing left and the noose has tightened around his King's neck.  He would be forced to exchange his Queen for the Rook on e3 and then Black would mop-up.
861,30,0,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is the first notable move avoiding all the Sicilian main lines this is called the Chekhover Variation. I really didn't think this was good for white and it probably wasn't but my inaccurate moves probably cost me the game.
862,30,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Initially I've thought that this was my first mistake but in actuality I think it was my next move that was the mistake. I think that had I played 4... a6 before developing my knight to c6 my game would have been better as in the next move I could attack the queen and gain some time to develop my other pieces.
863,30,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',That's fine he's just protecting his queen.

865,30,4,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',White: Two developed pieces and controlling the center. Black: 0 developed pieces and cramped. Guess who will win.
866,30,5,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Further increasing his development lead. I don't like my game too much at this point. His developed pieces and central control look overwhelming.
867,30,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/4pppp/p1pp1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Trying to get back into the game but it seems to have been too late.

869,30,8,e5,b'1rbqkb1r/4pppp/p1pp1n2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk -',Great. I can't take the pawn because I'd just end up with a queen less game with my king stuck in the center and 1 minor piece developed vs 3 minor pieces developed a castled king and two active rooks.
870,30,9,Ng8,b'1rbqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk -',So I retreat and now I have zero minor pieces developed my rook is kind of active but my development is so far behind that it doesn't matter. He has developed all his minor pieces plus the queen and he can now castle either side if he wants.
871,30,10,1O-O-O,b'1rbqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b k -',He castles queenside now his king is safe his rook has been activated and I have 0 minor pieces developed and the rook barely counts as a developed piece as it's not doing enough to allow me some time to develop my other pieces.
872,30,11,1Qc7,b'1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w k -',I thought about Qb6 for a while here offering my queen so that whatever attack was coming could be softened but I realized that I would have been left with a completely undeveloped kingside which would probably take too long to develop. The same thing happened anyway only with the Queens still on the board.
873,30,12,1Rhe1,b'1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b k -',Every one of his pieces is working towards the same goal. Central control and destroying my king. I was left with very few move options after this.
874,30,13,1Nxe5,b'1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1p5/4N1B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b k -',I was hoping for this. At least I will be up in material even though I am far behind in development.
875,30,14,fxg5,b'1rb1kbnr/2q1p1pp/p1p5/6p1/2NQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w k -',This was possibly a mistake but what else could I have done here? e6 and e5 were thoughts but I thought taking material was more important as I had missed the following move.
876,30,15,1Nd6+,b'1rb1kbnr/2q1p1pp/p1pN4/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b k -',Ouch. I can't take with the queen because he'd just win my queen for a knight and a bishop and my king would still be stuck in the center and very much in danger.
877,30,16,1Kd8,b'1rbk1bnr/2q1p1pp/p1pN4/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - -',I decide to give him my rook if he wants it.
878,30,17,1Nf7+,b'1rbk1bnr/2q1pNpp/p1p5/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',He does.

881,30,20,1Qf4+,b'1rb1kb1N/4p1pp/p1p2n2/6p1/5q2/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - -',There might have been better moves but I was studying and I had to move quickly. I had thought that I could develop my bishop to f5 after this which would get me closer to full development with a tempo even though I could have possibly lost the a pawn after Bf5. I also wanted to play Bf5 to prevent the h8 knight's escape route. I thought that if I could capture that knight for free I could possibly have a winning game or at least a drawing game.
882,30,21,Bd7,b'1r2kb1N/3bp1pp/p1p2n2/6p1/5q2/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 w - -',For some reason I quite don't remember I didn't continue with the plan that I had thought of earlier.

895,31,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',And white wants to control the center so moves c4; but e4 is probably better.

897,31,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/1pp5/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',A reasonable move in keeping with controlling the center.

900,31,6,Nxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/8/2PPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',My opponent firmly in the center now I take a minute to decide what it is I wish to do. And I have a plan; I will castle and try to prevent white from gaining more space while keeping the board has complicated as I can which is not what I usually do and then I'll look for a way to wrest the initiative away from white by causing as many threats as I can if he doesn't keep me on the defensive. Most games for those who've seen my annotated games I try to squeak out a small advantage and turn it into a winning endgame. Not so this one! Soon the position will become very fun.
901,31,7,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',This white choice is rather passive and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn.
902,31,8,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I make the best move here that Fritz likes. It forces white to admit that his seventh move was a mistake.
903,31,9,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Which he does admit rather than move his king. Rather than trade Bishops I decide to have a little fun first...
904,31,10,Qe7+,b'rnb1k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Although not one of Fritz's top two choices it is not a bad move to see how white will respond before trading bishops or castling. Plus I don't absolutely have to trade bishops although not doing so on my next turn may end up costing me a tempo.
905,31,11,Ne2,b'rnb1k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1BNPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This move is not one of Fritz's favorites either but it's no blunder. Better was the bishop so the knight would have the f3 space available.
906,31,12,Bg4,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP2b1/8/PP1BNPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I did this rather intentionally wanting the white f pawn on f3 instead of f4.
907,31,13,1f3,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP2b1/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White obliges.
908,31,14,1Bh5,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/7b/1bPP4/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Better was Be6 or Bd7. But I wanted either of two things: to provoke pawn advances on the Kingside where the white king protection will prove weaker later or failing that to keep some pressure indirectly on that diagonal. Now whether or not that is wise in this position is debateable and probably not such a good choice since the bishop won't be really that active until things change. I am assuming white will castle kingside. You know what they say about making assumptions... ;)
909,31,15,1d5,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/3P3b/1bP5/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is not the best choice by white either; better was trading bishops for white.
910,31,16,1cxd5,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p3p2/3p3b/1bP5/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Very bad move by me here allowing Qa4+. But white chooses something different...
911,31,17,1cxd5,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p3p2/3P3b/1b6/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',And of course I noticed Qa4 after we were already headed down that last sequence... so I wasted no time at all here...
912,31,18,1Bd6,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/8/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Whew. Got away with one there. Not a good way to play but in Blitz this happens. White still has a slight advantage here but soon I hope to change that.
913,31,19,1Qa4+,b'rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/Q7/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This comes too late. Perhaps white is subtly letting me know he saw this after he moved and decided he'd do it anyways. But now Black has no issues defending one of various ways.
914,31,20,1O-O-O,b'r3k2r/p2nqppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/Q7/5P2/PP1BN1PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',...and this move really surprised me. Will it take white too long to get his king behind the pawns? Immediately I castle next...
915,31,21,1O-O,b'r4rk1/p2nqppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/Q7/5P2/PP1BN1PP/2KR1B1R w - -',And now it is black with a slight advantage according to Fritz.
916,31,22,1Nd4,b'r4rk1/p2nqppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/Q2N4/5P2/PP1B2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',Now this is interesting to me because white sees he can mount a threatening attack in the center. But does so before getting his King in a more safe position. Is it worth the risk?
917,31,23,1Bg6,b'r4rk1/p2nqppp/1p1b1pb1/3P4/Q2N4/5P2/PP1B2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',After a brief think I decide to see if I can keep the white king away from a1 thinking I'll be able to defend adequately.
918,31,24,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/p2nqppp/1pNb1pb1/3P4/Q7/5P2/PP1B2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',I thought about moving a rook to pin the knight here. But now the game is getting complicated and I did not like the white bishop move to a6 followed by the h file rook moving to e1.Things might just end up getting simplified but I want more. After thinking some I decided to let my queen be chased a little.
919,31,25,1Bb5,b'r3qrk1/p2n1ppp/1pNb1pb1/1B1P4/Q7/5P2/PP1B2PP/2KR3R b - -',But instead of Re1 or other moves Fritz happened to like white thinks to add his own pressure but it's not real. The knight can still be pinned if but for a minute. And here I begin to see some interesting possibilities involving a queen sacrifice by me. I don't expect my opponent to miss it but it will further complicate the board and so I think why not? Usually in Blitz I don't do that because it's too easy to miss stuff. And of course more accurate would be a6 leading to the eventual loss of the white d pawn or worse for white. But it's Blitz I don't think of that during this game occupied with thoughts of creating interesting possibilities with discovered check on the white king. So instead...
920,31,26,1Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/p2n1ppp/1pNb1pb1/1B1P4/Q7/5P2/PP1B2PP/2KR3R w - -',Finally white begins to think about his king protection and getting another threat going by advancing his pawns. He would do well to trade off a few pieces by Bb4 but chooses something else...
921,31,27,1h4,b'r1q2rk1/p2n1ppp/1pNb1pb1/1B1P4/Q6P/5P2/PP1B2P1/2KR3R b - h3',There is better for black to do here but I simply respond with...
922,31,28,1h5,b'r1q2rk1/p2n1pp1/1pNb1pb1/1B1P3p/Q6P/5P2/PP1B2P1/2KR3R w - h6',It's funny; we are both missing the little things we can do to gain advantages around the a through d files and are wasting time maneuvering on the f through h files here. That won't continue long. I really just wanted space for my bishop to retreat so I could keep that diagonal under pressure. I'm done messing over there; I don't even care if I lose that h pawn at this point because doubled white pawns on the h file will take a while to become a threat and will be weak besides.
923,31,29,1g4,b'r1q2rk1/p2n1pp1/1pNb1pb1/1B1P3p/Q5PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R b - g3',And now my attention is elswhere. I believe white doesn't have time to do anything good for himself over there and so I begin to think again on what I can do to cause trouble for white's king after the brief distraction.
924,31,30,1Nc5,b'r1q2rk1/p4pp1/1pNb1pb1/1BnP3p/Q5PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R w - -',Fritz doesn't like this but I am setting up something sneaky now that I first thought of around move 16..
925,31,31,2Qd4,b'r1q2rk1/p4pp1/1pNb1pb1/1BnP3p/3Q2PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R b - -',White responds here with the best move. One I thought he would actually.
926,31,32,2Be5,b'r1q2rk1/p4pp1/1pN2pb1/1BnPb2p/3Q2PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R w - -',Qxc5 was possible here but white chooses something else which still results in something similar. For the moment white has forgotten about those g and h pawns.
927,31,33,Kh8,b'r1q2r1k/p3Npp1/1p3pb1/1BnPb2p/3Q2PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R w - -',Better was Kh7 perhaps; but I wanted room for my light-squared bishop on h7.
928,31,34,2Nxc8,b'r1N2r1k/p4pp1/1p3pb1/1BnPb2p/3Q2PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R b - -',And now I decide here after having seen this position some moves ago to take the knight with the rook. I should have used the a rook but oh well.
929,31,35,2Rfxc8,b'r1r4k/p4pp1/1p3pb1/1BnPb2p/3Q2PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R w - -',White just saw me let him capture my queen. Fritz thinks best play results in a mostly even game here! This is because there are a LOT of complications and tactics in this position. I so love it. I really don't care if I lose here; it's the fun of chess that I enjoy and usually I don't get into this kind of fun position. With best play by both sides white comes out with a bit less than a pawn advantage... well for as far ahead as Fritzs sees in only a few minutes. But since this was a Blitz game and I laid this 'trap' if you will a while back I'm hoping white does not see that he must block the c file or lose the game. White needs to do that with his queen or bishop of course; either way the white queen must be 'given back'. 
930,31,36,2Qxe5,b'r1r4k/p4pp1/1p3pb1/1BnPQ2p/6PP/5P2/PP1B4/2KR3R b - -',Alas white gets greedy and doesn't really look at the position. The mate in one is not hard to spot here and I had been aware of nearly this exact position for some moves now not expecting to see the opportunity to make the mate happen.
931,31,37,2Nb3#,b'r1r4k/p4pp1/1p3pb1/1B1PQ2p/6PP/1n3P2/PP1B4/2KR3R w - -',With the escape square covered and two pieces delivering check the king cannot escape. Although this game was filled with several minor errors it was still fun to create a complicated position and play it inasmuch as it was. Here's hoping you enjoyed the sharp positions!
932,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The e4 open by White in my mind is the strongest open. D4 is okay too.  Anything else tells me my opponent needs a lesson in chess. 
933,32,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I never respond to e4 Ruy Lopez and so I have the French or the Sicilian or the Caro-Kann in my mind as a response.  Rule out the French Defense because the barricades there limit Black to do anything except defend.  Rule in Sicilian or Caro-Kann and then an attack is possible and imminent by Black--and isn't the best defense an Attack? Sometimes I do Sicilian and in this case I do it. 
934,32,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I like the Sicilian Scheveningen variation above the rest. My records in the past when I use Sicilian will show this. 
935,32,3,Bxc3,b'r1b1k1nr/1pqp2pp/p3pp2/8/3BP3/P1bB4/1PPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I think I made a mistake here in retrospect.  I thought later about not trading away the bishop and felt I had better opportunities.  However hindsight is easier than foresight. 
936,32,4,Ne7,b'r1b1k2r/1pqpn1pp/p3pp2/8/4P3/P1BB4/1PPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',"And this is now my problem.  I am essentially behind in development while White has traded with a front I can't attack. I lost the attack here.  ""In the fog of war"" sort of thing.

938,32,6,1d6,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1n1pp/p2ppp2/8/4PP2/P1BB4/1PPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I gather my Infantry together...

946,32,14,2Bc4,b'r6k/3bqrp1/7p/p3pP1P/p1BpP3/6R1/1PPQ4/2K3R1 b - -',I see the weakness again on castling Queen side.  It usually turns out to be a more vulnerable position for the White or Black King to do the Q side castle.  The a1 and b1 squares are open for a prying move to break the box the King is in.  
947,32,15,2a3,b'r6k/3bqrp1/7p/p3pP1P/2BpP3/p5R1/1PPQ4/2K3R1 w - -',If White takes my rook with his bishop then there is nothing to stop the a3 pawn now.  What will White do now?

After suffering Henry being buried alive after a dogged rear-guard draw against Dynamic Dave I think it is time for you to see Yours Truly go on the attack for a change.  This is my most recent game and it ended with my opponent's king getting trapped in the centre and then subsequently copping Old Matey.  So how did this happen?  Well after my standard 1. e4 JJ plays a favourite defense of the Master Mater.  He really does lurve playing 1. ..... Nf6 in response to e4.

My queen is out of position for any defense. His pieces are imposing themselves on my king very nicely.  However I do try to make something out of this and continue on.

Overall I can proudly say that I fought valiantly against stalhandske and I thank him for the game!
1026,37,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',One of my most unsuccessful openings. Almost all the games in which I chose it led to my defeat -- fortunately there weren't that many of them. Those I can remember now were with A. Bannik (USSR Championship Riga 1958) and L. Portisch (at the European Team Championship Oberhausen 1961). At that point my 'French Career' came to an end I feel the losses were not accidental. Black in the French has to play with great accuracy and this is a quality I never had a great measure of neither now nor in my earlier days.
1027,37,1,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',It is not out of any desire to avoid early complications that Nezhmetdinov avoids the sharpest line approved by theory namely 5.a3 Bxc3+ (possibly I would have tried 5...Ba5 as in my game with Robert Fischer at 1960 Leipzig Olympiad) 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 cxd4 with very complex play. The old move chosen by White does not have a very good reputation but he had had a number of fine wins with it. One should note that as a rule the talented master did not try for a 'theoretical advantage'. He was normally interested in getting a tense and intresting position in which one could just play chess.
1028,37,2,a3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',It is well known that in this position there is no harm for Black in permitting the knight to come in at d6 by 6.Nb5 Bxd2+ 7.Qxd2 0-0.

Furman had played the move two months earlier against Krogius in a game in the USSR Championship Semi-Final. Krogius's attempt to play along normal lines by 8.Qg4 Nf5 9.Bd3 h5 10.Qh3 Qg5 let Black get an excellent game. Nezhmetdinov preferred to vary.

1031,37,5,Nd7,b'r1b1k2r/p1qnnppp/1p2p3/2ppP3/1P1P4/P1B2N2/2P2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black could also consider 9...cxb4!? 10.Bxb4 a5 when White can not stay on a3-f8 diagonal since 11.Bd6 is met by 11.Qc3+. Nor does a preliminary Bb5+ change this state of affairs. After 11.Bd2 Black can play either 11...0-0 or 11...Ba6. Admittedly in this line Black has to take account of a weakness at b6. The text is certainly not bad.
1032,37,6,Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/p1qn1ppp/1pn1p3/2ppP3/1P1P4/P1B2N2/2P1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',The struggle for the center is in full flight.

I remember examining the position arising from 13...Nxc5 14.Bd3 Ne4 (the threat was 15.Bxh7+ while 14...Nxd3 lets White have the initiative) 15.Qe1 and I decided that Black would either have to exchange on c3 or weaken his position by 15...f5. In neither case did I like the look of my position. Then while examining 13...Nxc5 I found myself distracted by the vague idea that capturing the e-pawn must in fact be much stronger. I worked through one variation and came to the conclusion that I would be able to occupy the center with my pawns. I stopped analysing beyond the 20th move and this very position arose in the game! According to all rules which I already knew quite well those days to have a pawn center was a good thing. Now I am inclined to think that I was also influenced by the tournament position - I had made a good start and scored 4.5/5 before this game so I was even more inclined than usual to an optimistic view of things.

After the game it was established that 13...Nxc5 would have given Black a fine game. The point is that after 14.Bd3 Ne4 15.Qe1 Black has the quiet but strong move 15...Bb7. Since the pawn is taboo - 16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Qxe4 Ne7 - Black holds the e4 point and can look to the future with confidence. The move I actually played was probably a decisive mistake though it takes White's exemplary play to demonstrate this.

However even after 16...Nd7 17.f5 White has a considerable advantage - taking the c5-pawn is not playable because of the pin on the a3-f8 diagonal. 
1037,37,11,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/p1q3pp/2n1pp2/2Pp4/5P2/P1B1Q3/2P1B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Possibly the lesser evil was to go in for passive defence by 17...Ne7 but by preparing c2-c4 White would be in complete control.

1039,37,13,2Bb5,b'r1br2k1/p1q3pp/2n5/1BPpp3/8/P1B1Q3/2P3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',This move too had figured in my original calculations. The attempt to win a piece by 20...d4 fails to 21.Qe4 (Not so clear is 21.Bc4+ Kh8 22.Qg5 h6! 23.Qg6 Ne7) when the bishop cannot be taken because of 22.Bc4+ Kh8 23.Qxc6! while after 21...Bb7 22.Bc4+ Kh8 23.Rf7 Rd7 (Sacrificing the queen is not good enough: 23...dxc3 24.Rxc7 Rxd1+ 25.Kf2 Rd4 26.Qe3) 24.Rdf1 is very good for White.
1040,37,14,2Bb7,b'r2r2k1/pbq3pp/2n5/1BPpp3/8/P1B1Q3/2P3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Now however I was satisfied with my position. White cannot win the e-pawn because of the little piece of tactics 21.Bxc6? d4! and Black keeps his pawn center intact. Unfortunately I had missed one vital point - the pawn center although in no danger is also of no value. This was underlined by White's next move.
1041,37,15,2Qg3,b'r2r2k1/pbq3pp/2n5/1BPpp3/8/P1B3Q1/2P3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Suddenly I realised my opponent had assesed the position much more deeply than I had. The pressure on the e-pawn will sooner or later force Black to advance one of the center pawns thus destroying the harmony of the two pawns abreast. Advancing the d-pawn always lets White play Bc4 thus taking part in an attack on the king. If the e-pawn is advanced then it is the other bishop which comes to life. For the moment however I did not consider my position to be too bad and further defended g7.
1042,37,16,2Rf2,b'r5k1/pbqr2pp/2n5/1BPpp3/8/P1B3Q1/2P2RPP/3R2K1 b - -',Such quiet moves often make a stronger impression than a wild combination with heavy sacrifices. The threat is 23.Bxc6 Qxc6 24.Qxe5 thus revealing one of the points of the move - the c5-pawn will not taken with check. Another point is seen in the variation: 22...d4 23.Bc4+ Kh8 24.Rdf1.
1043,37,17,2h3,b'4r1k1/pbqr2pp/2n5/1BPpp3/8/P1B3QP/2P2RP1/3R2K1 b - -',This is a quiet move which opens a bolt hole for the king in case of emergency and is the simplest way to underline the fact that Black's position is hopeless. I thought for about an hour here without finding a decent plan and there finally came the eloquent move ...

No doubt I would have lost the game even if I had two hours left on my clock but as it was I only had two minutes - the agony was not prolonged.
1049,37,23,2e4,b'b3r1k1/p1qr2pp/2n5/2Pp1R2/B3p3/P1B3QP/2P3P1/3R3K w - -',The e-pawn could no longer be guarded and 26...d4 is met by the thematic 27.Bb3+ Kh8 28.Rdf1 Qd8 29.Rf7 Rxf7 30.Rxf7 Rg8 31.Bd2 and the entry of the dark-squared bishop into the attack is decisive.

1051,37,25,e2,b'b3r1k1/p1rR2pp/2n5/2P5/B7/P1B4P/2P1p1P1/3R3K w - -',Clearly a blunder but if 29...Re7 then 30.Rxc7 Rxc7 31.Rd6 and Black can resign.
1052,37,26,Re6,b'b5k1/p1rR2pp/2n1r3/2P5/8/PBB4P/2P1p1P1/3R3K w - -',Otherwise it is immidiate mate.

Shortly after these notes were written the chess world heard with regret of the death of the great chess artist Rashid Nezhmetdinov. Players die tournaments are forgotten but the works of great artists are left behind them to live on for ever in memory of their creators.


Let this game and notes remain as my modest tribute to the memory of a fine player.

1055,38,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',stegal played e5 very standard move
1056,38,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 was played attacking e5 pawn.
1057,38,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',black played d6 indicates that he is going for Philidor's defense.  
1058,38,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I played d4 challenging the e5 pawn immediately also making way for the lsb.
1059,38,5,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',exd4 was played this is known as the exchange variation of Philidor's defense.
1060,38,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nxd4 stand move.
1061,38,7,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',This move actually surprise me black didn't play a normal looking move such as Nf6 or g6 but c5 was played attacking the knight. 
1062,38,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 was played this wasn't an accurate move may be Bb5+ is stronger because Nf3 allows black to play Bg4.

1065,38,11,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5b2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',To my surprise again Bxf3 was played! black gives up his lsb. If I were black I would keep the lsb instead of playing bxf3 I would play g6 and prepare for Bg7 because pawns on c5 and d6 is blocking the dsb. Bg7 allows the dsb to work on a better diagonal.
1066,38,12,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',never mind Bxf3

1084,38,30,1Bh5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p1n/3p4/2p1n1bB/4P3/2N4Q/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - -',So Bh5 was played now I'm a bit worried because black now have the initiative I must find a way to continue the attack.
1085,38,31,1a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3p1n/p2p4/2p1n1bB/4P3/2N4Q/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R w - -',a6 was played I wasn't sure why black played this move seems that black is preparing for b5 pawnstorms my queen side?
1086,38,32,1Qg3,b'r2q1rk1/1p3p1n/p2p4/2p1n1bB/4P3/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - -',Qg3 pins the dsb either f4 or h4 is coming next

1088,38,34,1f4,b'r2q1r1k/1p3p1n/p2p4/2p1n1bB/4PP2/2N3Q1/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - f3',f4 but then I realized black does not need to worry at all because he still have Bh4 attacks white queen 
1089,38,35,1Bh4,b'r2q1r1k/1p3p1n/p2p4/2p1n2B/4PP1b/2N3Q1/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',Bh4

1091,38,37,1Nc4,b'r2q1r1k/1p3p1n/p2p4/2p4B/2n1PP1b/2N1Q3/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - -',yep here it comes my queen got chased around.

1100,38,46,2g5,b'r2q1r1k/5p1n/p2p1b2/1ppN2PB/2n1PP2/8/PPP1Q2P/1K1R2R1 b - -',g5 sacrificing b2 pawn and adding more pressure to the black king side.

1123,39,1,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4p3/8/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',A rather brash move sticking a pawn in the middle of the board with only a single knight as protector. In addition the bishop at b3 has a clear aim at the vulnerable f7-square.
1124,39,2,Nxe5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4N2b/8/1BNP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',A brilliant move! A familiar theme with the twist that Black has greater development than usual when the classic queen sacrifice is used.
1125,39,3,Kd4,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1nn5/6B1/3kNP2/3P3P/PPP3P1/R2bK2R w KQ -',13... Kf5 is horrible blunder. 14.Ng3#.
1126,39,4,1Rxd1,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1nn5/6B1/3kNP2/3P3P/PPP3P1/3RK2R b K -',The Black king has been driven to d4 and the extra queen is of no use. The king tries to hide on e3.
1127,39,5,1Ke3,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1nn5/6B1/4NP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/3RK2R w K -',14... Qxg5 15.c3+ Ke3 16.fxg5 also wins.
1128,39,6,1O-O,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1nn5/6B1/4NP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/3R1RK1 b - -',A good move!
1129,39,7,1Nd4,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1n6/6B1/3nNP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/3R1RK1 w - -',White announced mate in 6.
1130,39,8,Kd4,b'r2q1b1r/ppp3pp/1n6/6BB/3kNP2/3P1R1P/PPP3P1/6K1 w - -',19... Ke2 20.Rg3+ Ke1 21.Re3#.
1131,39,9,2Bf7,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1n6/6B1/3kNP2/3P1R1P/PPP3P1/6K1 b - -',The checkmate will be delivered by the pawns.
1132,39,10,2bxc3#,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/8/6B1/3kNP2/2PP1R1P/P5P1/6K1 b - -',Now you may well think that this game is cmposed. Especially when my source for the game indicated it was dedicated by Mr. Wellmuth to the late Perrier. The sparkling gem was created in the middle of a World War when there wasn't time or opportunity serious tournament play and I'll admit the the other offerings fro that year didn't impress me enough to set this aside and besides it doesn't seem to be well known. Actually it isn't all that complicated just long. Notice how few branches had to be calculated. A very short computer analysis found the move but concluded that Black might gain a slight advantage. Of course an exhaustive search would have led the program to the correct conclusion. Even after looking just 7 movesahead White gained advantage.
