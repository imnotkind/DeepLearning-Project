160,4,0,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My standard first move. Many people I'm sure will give this a ?! as it does nothing for my development or the centre. However I prefer black's opening setups to white's and 1. a3 not only allows me to adopt those but sometimes it can be useful.
161,4,1,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/P7/1PPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',A sort of latvian gambit with the colours reversed. Although not entirely sound it often makes for an exiting game!

165,4,5,Be2,b'r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/3p1n2/4p3/4PP2/P1N2N2/1PPPB1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I felt that Bc4 would expose my bishop to a future a6 and b5 (I move my bishop probably to a2) followed by Bb7 when black has a very strong bishop on the long diagonal and a lot of queenside space and potential counterplay. However I needed to get castled before black could stop me by placing his queen or bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal.

Although there is no immediate tactical response this gives me the kingside weaknesses (in particular the h5-e8 diagonal which can no longer be defended with g6) that I need to damage his position. Note how the light squares become very weak for black after he exchanges his bishop.

398,12,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian is often seen at master level. It can lead to very sharp play as explained in some other annotations of mine. I normally see 1...e5 in my games.
399,12,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A somewhat non-committal move as Black can still choose from many Sicilian systems such as the Scheveningen the Taimanov and the Kan variation. Nevertheless 2...d6 is more often seen which can lead to the hyper-sharp Najdorf and dragon variations. Another possibility is 2...Nc6 which can lead to the accelerated dragon and the Sveshnikov. (Other transpositions are also possible) Another advantage of this move is that it discourages 3.Bb5 as after 3...a6! the bishop has to retreat because 4.Ba4?? b5 5.Bb3 c4 loses it. This move (3.Bb5) is a good possibility against 2...d6 and 2...Nc6 though.
400,12,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I stick with what I know - the open Sicilians.
401,12,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Kan variation - a rock solid approach but it can have quite some 'bite' if either player is not careful.
402,12,4,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/3p1ppp/p3p3/1p6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq b6',Black chooses to expand early on the queenside without even developing a piece. This is the so-called minority attack: Black has a 3 vs. 2 minority on the queenside so if two pairs of pawns are exchanged white is left with an isolated pawn on that side of the board which can be attacked easily by the open lines that are created.
403,12,5,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black also wants to control a small share of the centre though White hasmore control on that part of the board for now.
404,12,6,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I keep making solid developing moves. In many variations of the Sicilian I like to castle queenside but as Black already has an attack going at that side (and to be honest another reason was that I was playing a master) I chose the safer approach.
405,12,7,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This move is rarely seen. Far more common are 7...Nf6 and 7...Bb7.
406,12,8,a4,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p2pp3/1p6/P2NP3/2NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq a3',Trying to induce Black's pawns forward to be able to attack them and break them up. The immediate threat is 9.axb5 on which Black can't respond 9...axb5?? on account of the hanging rook on a8. I was aware of the fact that I followed a game in the database which ended in a win for Black and I knew that I would probably have to deviate to hope for a better result than in that game.
407,12,9,b4,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p2pp3/8/Pp1NP3/2NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',But to my delight the master deviates first. The move played in the game we followed 8...bxa4 looks somewhat illogical as it isolates the a pawn which can be attacked easily as it is on an open file after White retakes.
408,12,10,Na2,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p2pp3/8/Pp1NP3/3B4/NPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Attacking the pawn. Other squares are even worse: 9.Nde2 blocks a good developing square for the queen and on b1 the knight is nothing but a spectator as a3 and c3 are both controlled by the pawn on b4 and there doesn't seem to be a nice spot which the knight can go to in the near future. Also it blocks the rook from developing so it has to move again soon (after the bishop and queen are out). That combined with what I saw in games in the opening DB and with earlier experience in this variation (not this particular position) were the reasons why I preferred this move.
409,12,11,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p2p4/4p3/Pp1NP3/3B4/NPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? Normally I would hesitate to give a move made by a master a ? but as the master admitted this move was a plain oversight. Ion had written the notation down wrongly so he had the wrong position on the board. As he didn't look at the board on the GK site properly he made this blunder... Fortunately for him it was only a pawn that I could win.
410,12,12,1Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/3n1ppp/p1Np4/4p3/Pp2P3/3B4/NPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! This simple knight fork (with double attack on b4) wins me a pawn. I was really hesitating to make this move as I was afraid the master had set a trap which I was not aware of but I couldn't find a reason not to play it so I decided I would try and see what would happen.
411,12,13,1Ncxb4,b'r1b1kbnr/3n1ppp/pq1p4/4p3/PN2P3/3B4/NPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',At first I wanted to play 11.Naxb4?? until I discovered that that would be a horrible blunder as 11...a5 wins a piece (the knights can't defend each other anymore). The computer gives me a decisive edge (+1.91) at this point while Ion felt that he had some compensation in an active game and open lines for his pieces now. I'm not sure who is right or wrong as I felt I also had active piece play and especially a strong grip on the centre so I thought my advantage was at least a clear pawn.
412,12,14,1Be3,b'r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/pq1p1n2/4p3/PN2P3/3BB3/NPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Developing with tempo but my advantage drops slightly to +1.51. I'm not sure what is wrong with this though...
413,12,15,1Qb7,b'r1b1kb1r/1q1n1ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/PN2P3/3BB3/NPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I would expect the bishop to develop to this spot but if the queen would go to a5/d8 or c7 there could be some tactics involving knight forks on c6 or d5 respectively and on b8 she blocks the natural square for the rook.
414,12,16,1f4,b'r1b1kb1r/1q1n1ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/PN2PP2/3BB3/NPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq f3',!? Gaining space in the centre and preparing a kingside assault as is often the plan in the Sicilian for White. However Black's position has no weaknesses at that side of the board (which is often the case in the Kan) and maybe I should have switched my attention to the queenside in particular the weak a6 pawn (but 13.Qe2 would be strongly met with 13...Nc5 when I have to concede the bishop pair because 14.Bc4 loses the a pawn).
415,12,17,1Kh1,b'r1b1k2r/1q1nbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/PN2PP2/3BB3/NPP3PP/R2Q1R1K b kq -',There are many options here but I decided to make a waiting move to see what Black would do. Another move I considered was 14.Qe2 but I didn't like to concede the bishop pair after 14...Nc5. Still it could be a good move as after (14.Qe2 Nc5) 15.Bxc5 dxc5 Black has many weaknesses on the queenside.

Though the computer doesn't spot an inaccuracy my advantage decreases by 0.3 or 0.4 points with every move I make and has now fallen to only +0.45 (while I still had the feeling that I was far better if not winning though I knew who I was playing against).
417,12,19,1Bc4,b'r1b2rk1/1q1nbppp/p4n2/4p3/PNB1P3/4B3/NPP3PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',?? And here I make a horrible blunder. I had probably forgotten that the exchange on e5 had also opened a line for Black... My idea of course was an attack on the f file and f7 in partiicular but that didn't quite happen.

In an OTB game it is quite normal to make two mistakes in a row due to the psychological effect but it's not necessary in a correspondence game. My idea was to place a rook on e1 of course.

426,12,28,Bf2#,b'r4rk1/3Q1ppp/p7/4p1B1/P6K/2P2q2/NP3b1P/R7 w - -',A convincing win for the master but I had a good game until my blunder at move 16. Thanks for reading I'd like to receive some comments. Ion thanks for this lesson I hope we can play another game soon.
427,13,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The following game is a variation of the Ruy Lopez that I enjoyed because it demonstrates how delaying the castle allows white to gain piecemeal advantage. This game would not be at masters level.. my rate fluctuates from 1480 to 1540. So this is game played at the mid 1550 level. 
428,13,1,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move is a mistake. Black expects one of two things; either O-O-O or Bxc6+. However this move is not prepared to meet d4 w/o losing a pawn
429,13,2,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Black could chose cx4 but that would be worse than a6. White could respond to cx4 with Ncx4 which wins white development. F6 would be even worse because it blocks black's knight from moving ou. 
430,13,3,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I don't agree with this move. The sequence it inaugurates ends badly for black. I would chose Qe7.. with the plan of Bg3 to pin white's knight and then rd8 to exploit the opening in the pawn line. 
431,13,4,dxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1pp4/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White is up a point but is winning the opening decisively. Black's knight cannot move out anywhere safely the bishop on f8 is trapped as well. It will be very hard from here on out for black to castle. Black makes the best choice possible on this situation to try and regain momentum. 
432,13,5,a5,b'r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/2pp4/p3P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Bg4 links the queen and the rock which would free up black to take the e5 pawn and even out material. This will work but it allows white to develop faster. 
433,13,6,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/2p2ppp/2pp4/p3P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I don't agree with this bishop aggression. Bg4 is better because the bishop is defended by the rook black doesn't have to keep moving it. It also allows white to move Bf4 b/c the rook isn't threatened. 
434,13,7,Bf4,b'r2qkbnr/2p2ppp/2pp4/p3P3/4PBb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Erasing the material deficit just became much more difficult. 
435,13,8,Ne7,b'r2qkb1r/2p1nppp/2pp4/p3P3/4PBb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I don't agree with this move.. there is nowhere the knight can productively go from e7. Black moves it because he needs to castle but I think moving the g6 then black's Bh6 is a better choice. 
436,13,9,Qd3,b'r2qkb1r/2p1nppp/2pp4/p3P3/4PBb1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',White has several options at this point.. Nd2 might have been a more prudent choice than moving the queen out. 
437,13,10,Rb8,b'1r1qkb1r/2p1nppp/2pp4/p3P3/4PBb1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w k -',This move is a waste. The rook will end up on the d column once black initiates the queen trade.

440,13,13,1Be2,b'3rkb1r/2p1nppp/2p5/p3N3/4PB2/1P6/P1P1bPPP/RN3RK1 w k -',A mistake. Forcing Re1 is good for white the rook has to move out eventually and re1 protects the e4 pawn.

Don't isolate the rook from the back rank unless the king is well defended. 

As always I'd like to thank black for the game. "

Is that what you would have played. It is interesting that in a couple of games this season I have got into trouble by not playing aggressively enough but in this game the errors I make are being over-aggressive and not castling sooner. Now I was hoping for him to move his knight so I can answer b4 with Nd5 and if he takes I take back with the queen leaving his d pawn weak backward on a semi-open file. But of course he plays.....
486,14,27,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p2pbnp1/2p3P1/1p2P3/2N2P2/PPPQBB1P/R3K2R w KQ -',And he is ok. Fritz now thinks Nd1 is best - although still good for black but to me it looked hopeless to have the knight there - for the time being it has to stay on d1 protecting b2 so presumably I would have to play c3 or c4 something to release it.

O-O-O Rfb8 19. c3 Ra7 and thinking I have to play Be3 so that I can play Rd2 without worrying about him playing Bf6-g5 winning. However Fritz pointed out Bxf6 17. Qa3 Bh4! with advantage to Black.

500,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game begins on the well-trodden path of the Ruy Lopez. But delving into a lesser known variation White makes a risky move that triggers a violent attack against his own king. 
501,16,1,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/B1P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',White's set-up has been played before and aims to clamp down on any future Black hopes of the freeing advance of his d-pawn to d5.
502,16,2,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pbp/p1np1np1/4p3/B1P1P3/2NP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So what is there for Black to do? His opponent has an excellent grip on the light squares and has left Black very little room to manoeuvre. There will be a bit more space if a piece is traded. After that; Black has a set-up which indicates that he should aim to play f7-f5.
503,16,3,Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pbp/p2p2p1/7n/B1PpP3/3P3P/PP2NPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',There is no way to be sure that this is correct. Nevertheless it looks a bit more active than other knight moves - and it is also a little provocative.
504,16,4,1g4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pbp/p2p2p1/7n/B1PpP1P1/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 b - g3',[?!] White is a strong player and experience would have told him that this sort of pawn advance in front of a king can be risky. On the other hand; there appears no particular danger at this point and - when the knight retreats - he will have  made Black's idea of f7-f5 even more problematic.
505,16,5,1Qh4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2pbp/p2p2p1/7n/B1PpP1Pq/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',[!] But now there is a problem: Black relies on the weakened king's position and is determined to create counter-play - even at the cost of a piece. I felt that at worst I could probably escape with a perpetual check if things did not 'work out'.
506,16,6,f5,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2p1/5p1P/B1PpP2q/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - f6',The obvious move was to play 13...Bxh3. But there is really no rush and the top priority is to open the f-file and add the rook to the attack.
507,16,7,fxe4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2pP/8/B1Ppp2q/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',[!] Taking my life in my hands here to some extent - but in fact this is stronger than moving the bishop. Anything else will allow White to play either f2-f4 or f2-f3 and organize a defence involving moves such as Rf2 and Qf1 for example.
508,16,8,1dxe4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2pP/8/B1PpP2q/7P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',The best move: If White takes the bishop then he has to reckon on ...Rf3 which blocks his f-pawn. After that Black now has three attackers [counting his c8 bishop] the white h-pawn is still en prise and there are  potential mating threats against both g2 and h1.
509,16,9,1Bxh3,b'r4rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2pP/8/B1PpP2q/7b/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I couldn't think of anything better than to start the threats.
510,16,10,Rf3,b'r5k1/1pp3Pp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpP2q/5r1b/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I am not completely sure that this position is lost for White - but despite being two pieces up; it is obviously going to be difficult to defend.
511,16,11,1Qe1,b'r5k1/1pp3Pp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpP2q/5r1b/PP2NP2/R1B1QRK1 b - -',I think it was essential to return some material here and play either Nf4 or Bf4 and hope for the best.
512,16,12,1Kxg7,b'r7/1pp3kp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpP2q/5r1b/PP2NP2/R1B1QRK1 w - -',The pawn is captured so as to add Black's last piece to the attack.
513,16,13,1Qd2,b'r7/1pp3kp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpP2q/5r1b/PP1QNP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',With the idea of exchanging queens - even with Qh6.

515,16,15,Raf8,b'5r2/1pp3kp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpP1q1/5rNb/PP1Q1P2/R1B2RK1 w - -',Note that now Black is threatening Rxg3 followed by Rxf1. So White moves the rook away.
516,16,16,Rf4,b'8/1pp3kp/p2p2p1/8/B1PpPr2/6qb/PP1Q4/R1BR3K w - -',[!!] This is the end: White has a few checks true: But my opponent knows that all they achieve is to remove his queen from the defence of g2. If White plays Rg1 here then the response is the final sacrifice ...Bg2+!! with a quick mate after either capture.

Even though I am two pieces ahead with a +2 the game is inevitably lost.  That is because he will win my queen at best and mate me at worst.  In fact he will be able to find a mating pattern against me in this position and it is inevitable.  Therefore I resign at this point.  10.Nd5 was the mistake because it caused my king to become exposed.  This shows that one blunder could win or loose a game.

White has multiple choices here which can lead to very different games. 3. Bb5 (Ruy Lopez) is the most played. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn.

The most common move is the Morphy defence : 3...a6 forcing White to make a decision about his bishop. Many other moves are available some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.

maxiol09: No in this moment
me: Even with the two pawn gain...i would rather offer draw...want a Draw? ( I said this after he opened the b6 square to my night with 13. ... c6)
me: will give you a couple minutes to think about it...next move is Na8
maxiol09: I don't understand
me: My next move...Na8 i will trade Knight for Rook a plus two point (or pawn) gain in material...even though it puts me ahead ...I would be willing to give you a draw....as I am not at ease with my chances of winning (not in a couple minutes anyways)
me: Do you want me to offer a Draw?
maxiol09: why? we just started playing!
me: i dont think i can finish in one hour and beat you...if you dont mind it going over its ok (I offered the draw after the c4 push)

It took me an hour to get where I wanted to be (13. ... c6 )in an open I am not familiar with...I knew that they wanted it short from the start...so I gave away what was in my mind...a sure win... :-("

- crazy sharp opening 
- fast exchanges in the middle game 
- slow maneuverability on the endgame. 

I eventually created a passed and well advanced c pawn but white had enough counterplay to prevent me from promoting it even threatened promoting his own pawn with check so I forced a three fold repetition to end in a safe draw (white could only prevent this by playing a weakening move) and sent a draw offer..."

If you're behind in points start defending; if you're ahead in points you can do more attacking. No matter where you stand in your games you need to act as if no one is winning so that you don't hurry and mess up on your tactics.

Then when his Queen was doing nothing on a5 he could have moved it in the sense that something bad was going to happen. Alsothe openings are always on proper development (well almost always) and use what you have even if you are down material. Finally when you're down material you are forced to defend your position. What you do in the opening will affect you in the mid-game; what you do in the mid-game will affect you in the endgame and what you do then will affect the results. Chess is a colossal chain reaction and you better be careful about your moves. This is why you need to look at your move before comfirming it.

1081,36,8,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/p1ppqppp/1pn5/4P3/2P1bB2/P3PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',At first when I saw this I thought of Bg5 but then I thought is that the best I have? after 10.Bg5 f6 11.exf gxf white is clearly better and has ensured the pawn cannot be regained by black however whites position is fine as it is why create imbalences.

1086,36,13,1Be7,b'2kr3r/p1ppbppp/1p6/4P3/1qP1bB2/4P3/3N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',"? offering another pawn sacrafice but for what? The bishop isn't even very well developed here. and the connected rooks isn't a huge help right now. instead preserving the pawn was probably more accurate. If black want to sac a pawn then the pawn that should be saced should be the e pawn.

Another winning move was 14.e6! with tactics on c7 but I liked this move even more.

At least I have had some success in the Love Conquers All MT.  This game was against a Class C player called Paul.  When I first played him after joining The Coaching Club (now alas extinct) my rating was similar to his - we were both rated in the 1520s.  A lot has happened since then.  So how did I win this?  Well after kicking off with 1. e4 and my opponent responding with the Nimzowich Defense (named after GM Aeron Nimzowich) here is the Gameknot Analysis:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17043614&rnd=0.8169159996991752"
1143,39,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - I decided to open up lines for both my ecclesiastical twins and follow up with developing a knight.

With Step 4 Glenda jumps to g5 and now threatens Qh6 then Qg7#.  Yup the BK will cop Old Matey with the kiss of death.  Paul was aware of this and resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  After being on the receiving end of two successful mating attacks by my master buddies myself I am glad to be the giver this time round!
