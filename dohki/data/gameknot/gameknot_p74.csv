Even though as black you are not really supposed to move your kingside pawns the defense was necessary. White could have continued with g4 but that pawn may just get in the way if it captures f5.

133,4,22,1Bxh6,b'r4rk1/pp6/2n1q2b/5p2/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPQ/2K4R w - -',Qxh6 is bad since after the queen trade white is toast.
134,4,23,Kh7,b'r4r2/pp5k/2n1q2b/5p2/3P4/4P1Q1/PPP2PP1/2K4R w - -',White now has no way to attack. Black can now develop as slow as he pleases and start his attack on white.

The bottom line is grand masters use the Caro to date with acceptable success.  It is a defense for Black for Black to know what to do without the long and numerous moves in a Sicilian or the weak Ruy Lopez.  I rest the case to say my favorite defense as Black against e4 is the Caro Kann.  I have left the Sicilian and I had left the weak Ruy Lopez back in the 1980s.  To date the best defense against e4 open is Caro Kann.  Or maybe Alekhine's Defense! I've not lost faith with Alekhine to date! My records show it!

312,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Kramnik once said only a fool annotates Blitz games... I guess I'm a fool! But I do learn from them. I suppose the really strong players don't learn much from them hence his comments.
313,12,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Kramnik is right about one thing: unless your mind is like a computer analyzing long variations in Blitz is useless in the sense that blitz is inherently inaccurate to begin with and thinking time during play limited. But I privately bet that Kramnik has analyzed at least some of his own Blitz games he's lost just to see where he went wrong - provided it wasn't immediately apparent. It's so much fun to watch those great players play!
314,12,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Caro-Kann. Which is what I usually play as black as I do here.
315,12,3,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I always take if white doesn't advance the pawn. It makes for a boring game often enough but as black boring is easier to equalize... isn't it? ;)
316,12,4,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',All book so far...
317,12,5,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This move is one I hadn't seen before for whatever reason; normally I see Ng3 in this position.
318,12,6,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Fritz thinks this is the best move... I made it. Later I didn't like it.
319,12,7,Qxf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pq2/5b2/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I don't like this position. I don't like my queen being out so early even though it appears to be perfectly safe. it just seems awkwardly placed.
320,12,8,Qd8,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Fritz says that this is a mistake but do I really want my queen out without my other pieces leading the way? No. No. No! I don't. Did I say no enough times??
321,12,9,1c4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq c3',White has a dominating center right now and there will be good pressure on the queenside in a moment.
322,12,10,Qb6,b'rn2k2r/pp2bppp/1qp1p3/8/2PP2b1/1Q3N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',I think black is pretty solid here; but white has more space and is putting pressure on black in a couple ways. So here I am acknowledging this by offering a queen trade with the disruption of my queenside pawns as a result in order to alleviate that pressure which I don't like. c5 is not likely because of the weak pawn it would create on d4 but I still don't like the queenside.
323,12,11,1Bf4,b'rn2k2r/pp2bppp/1qp1p3/7b/2PP1B2/1Q3N1P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b kq -',Trading for black's knight is not white's main intent here; I believe it is simply white completing his development. His other choice was Be3. It may be that ...g5 could induce white to take the knight. But disrupting my kingside pawns in this fashion seemed dubious when the only compensation would be white losing the bishop pair.
324,12,12,1Qxb3,b'rn2k2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/7b/2PP1B2/1q3N1P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 w kq -',This is actually a bit of a mistake on my part now; but I was really worried about all of white's pieces pointing at the queenside. Nevertheless it gives white opportunities on the half-open a file that could be really useful  for white.

With Rfa1 after moving the bishop I'm not sure what progress white will make on the queenside but I don't like it. During the game I was fixated so much on that queenside that guess what...
327,12,15,1b6,b'r3k2r/p2nbppp/1pp1p3/R6b/2PP1B2/1P3N1P/1P2BPP1/5RK1 w kq -',...I neglect to notice my hanging bishop. I am moving very quickly and am too focused on that queenside! I played in my first tournament of over-the-board chess for 'National Chess day' and ended up playing someone who had a fide rating close to 2200... the tournament wasn't fide official but his rating was and he is very well known in my area. Anyways well into a complicated midgame I had at least a draw with winning chances had I seen a certain bishop move but in that game too I got too focused on one part of the board. This is something I'll work on. I believe it's why many at that level get up from the board and walk around; they're not all thinking on combinations I'd bet. I'd bet they're doing it to clear their mind and when they sit back down they see the board how it is since they have to notice the move that was made. Oh I may annotate that game here; I think it would be fun for some of you to analyze!

Interestingly enough black's position is rather solid despite being a piece down. Notice I took on c5 with the knight and not the bishop inviting the next few moves.
330,12,18,1b4,b'r3k2r/p3bppp/1p2p3/2n4R/1PP2B2/5N1P/1P2BPP1/5RK1 b kq -',I had hopefully anticipated all of these upcoming moves because I wanted to create a weakness on b4. I get my wish. It's interesting that white chose to worry about that one pawn instead of immediately pushing hard since he was a piece up. But because he did worry about that pawn it enabled me to reposition my pieces advantageously because his pieces are not yet working together well.
331,12,19,2Be5,b'r3k2r/p3bppp/1p2p3/4B2R/1PP5/1Pn2N1P/4BPP1/5RK1 b kq -',My opponent returns the favor of a 'colossal blunder'. He must not have noticed I would take the bishop with tempo and had his own tunnel vision going on. Perhaps he was willing to win the two pawns for the bishop. Perhaps he was thinking I'd naturally castle here.
332,12,20,2Nxe2+,b'r3k2r/p3bppp/1p2p3/4B2R/1PP5/1P3N1P/4nPP1/5RK1 w kq -',But taking with tempo saves my kingside pawns and from this point white never recovers.

334,12,22,2Bxb4,b'r3k2r/p5pp/1p2pp2/7R/1bP5/1P3N1P/1B2nPP1/5R1K w kq -',Fritz thinks 22. Re1 would have been much better for white. 22 ...Nf4 would have been more accurate for black. Instead these two moves are what we do. I grab the pawn intending Nc3 at some point soon.
335,12,23,Nc3,b'3rk2r/p5pp/1p2pp2/8/1bP1R3/1Pn2N1P/1B3PP1/5R1K w k -',Nc3 it is then. Now Fritz thinks white should take the knight but white likes that diagonal too much to part with it.

341,12,29,a5,b'7r/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p7/1bPNR3/1P1n3P/4RPP1/7K w - a6',Solidifying the black position. I am conscious that my opponent has had a lot of success in rated games. So before pushing forward I decide first to limit any counterplay as much as I could anyways.
342,12,30,3Kh2,b'7r/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p1b5/2P1R3/1P1n1N1P/4RPPK/8 b - -',White would have had to deal with Nxf2 had the king stayed on h1. Kg1 may have been better here despite subjecting the pawn to a pin if nothing else but to safeguard that pawn.
343,12,31,3Bxf2,b'7r/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p7/2P1R3/1P1n1N1P/4RbPK/8 w - -',A pawn's a pawn. Since this one was left for the grabbing why not. I'm sure I had better here and Fritz indicates that to be the case. But as Kramnik alludes too Blitz is inherently inaccurate.
344,12,32,3Ree2,b'7r/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p1b5/2P5/1P1n1N1P/2R1R1PK/8 b - -',It would appear white is trying to position for defense and hoping to find tactical possibilities too but rather out of the midgame and a piece down it's very difficult for white.
345,12,33,Bd6+,b'3r4/3r1kpp/1p1b1p2/p7/1nP5/1P3N1P/4R1PK/1R6 w - -',This is an attempt to get the king on the back row and my bishop to g3. Rather transparent white prevents that... but...
346,12,34,3g3,b'3r4/3r1kpp/1p1b1p2/p7/1nP5/1P3NPP/4R2K/1R6 b - -',...now the white king is more exposed. Either way I am happy with how that turned out; whether I can take advantage of it or not white's king will have to be careful with so many pieces still on the board.
347,12,35,3Bc5,b'3r4/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p1b5/1nP5/1P3NPP/4R2K/1R6 w - -',I get the bishop back out of the way for the time being. My knight is not in a rush to get to a more useful square just yet. I'd like to get rid of one of the white rooks.
348,12,36,3Rf1,b'3r4/3r1kpp/1p3p2/p1b5/1nP5/1P3NPP/4R2K/5R2 b - -',Threatening Ne5+ winning the exchange. Sometimes in Blitz things like that are not so easy to spot... but this time I prevent the fork.
349,12,37,3Rd7d1,b'3r4/5kpp/1p3p2/p1b5/1nP5/1P3NPP/4R2K/3r1R2 w - -',All I need to do as black to win is simply trade pieces; a basic premise when one is ahead especially against a good opponent.
350,12,38,3Ng5+,b'3r4/5kpp/1p3p2/p1b3N1/1nP5/1P4PP/4R2K/3r1R2 b - -',White checks me anyways but without a fork on the rook. hence Ng5 instead of Ne5.
351,12,39,3Kg6,b'3r4/6pp/1p3pk1/p1b3N1/1nP5/1P4PP/4R2K/3r1R2 w - -',And because of my rook on the first rank and white's knight enprise as well I get another wish: simplifying further.
352,12,40,4Ne4,b'8/6pp/1p3pk1/p1b5/1nP1N3/1P4PP/4R2K/3r4 b - -',I wouldn't mind parting with the bishop but not just yet! Here's why obviously enough to most of you: it would be at the expense of my queenside pawn structure AND the bishop is still useful for limiting the white knight until I reposition a few things. So I decline to trade it here.
353,12,41,Rd7,b'8/3rb1pp/1p3pk1/p7/1nP5/1P4PP/4RN1K/8 w - -',That was forced.
354,12,42,4Rb2,b'8/3rb1pp/1p3pk1/p7/1nP5/1P4PP/1R3N1K/8 b - -',For the last several moves white has been struggling to find meaningful counterplay. With my extra piece I have been able to thwart his efforts. I've been careful; remember he's played a lot of rated games with a lot of success. So I carefully maneuver until my king can join more in the action. I mean things on the queenside are static; so I have to get my king into the game so nothing is ceded.
355,12,43,Kf7,b'8/3rbkpp/1p3p2/p7/1nP5/1P4PP/1R3N1K/8 w - -',I am now willing to trade that dark-squared bishop for the knight.
356,12,44,Nc5,b'8/3rbkpp/1p3p2/p1n5/2P4P/1P4P1/3R1N1K/8 w - -',I wanted my knight here and thought white would move his rook back to b2. But to my surprise he traded while down a piece. This is not advisable even though Fritz would have done the same thing.
357,12,45,4Rxd7,b'8/3Rbkpp/1p3p2/p1n5/2P4P/1P4P1/5N1K/8 b - -',But white decides this helps him. I don't think so because now the 'percentage' I'm ahead has gone up even if the point difference remains the same.
358,12,46,Bd6,b'8/3n1kpp/1p1b1p2/p7/2P4P/1P1N2P1/7K/8 w - -',Limiting the knight again. From here it's academic. If you're really bored you can watch this to the end but there's nothing really interesting to see except for two things an inaccuracy by me on move 59 and my choice of strategies to complete the win. Otherwise the play is rather :ahem: ...boring. But thanks for checking this out to whatever degree! ;)
359,12,47,Ke6,b'8/3n2pp/1p1bkp2/p7/2P4P/1P1N2PK/8/8 w - -',My plan is to lock up the kingside force concessions/material advantages on the queenside with my extra pieces advance my king in the center and force white to defend both flanks until his position is so untenable that even he resigns. It's a pretty easy plan at this point. There may be other strategies to winning this endgame but just looking at the board this is what seems good to me.
360,12,48,fxg5,b'8/3n3p/1p1bk3/p5p1/2P5/1P1N2P1/6K1/8 w - -',This sequence of pawn trades was not recommended by Fritz. But it's part of my plan and will make winning more simple. I believe white now has zero drawing chances. I like simple when one will retain one's winning chances.
361,12,49,h5,b'8/8/1p1bk3/p1n3pp/2P5/1P3KP1/8/2N5 w - h6',Now with the white knight on the back rank it is time to push forward.
362,12,50,g4+,b'8/8/1p1b4/p1n1k2p/2P3p1/1P3KP1/8/2N5 w - -',Kingside locked up until I unlock it...
363,12,51,Be7,b'8/4b3/1p6/p1n1k2p/2P3p1/1P2K1P1/8/2N5 w - -',Now I force concessions on the queenside. There is no saving the b3 pawn. Perhaps white could have tried Ne2 Nf4 and Ng6 but it's far too slow and white couldn't retreat quickly enough to defend.
364,12,52,Nxb3,b'8/4b3/1p6/p3k2p/2P3p1/1n2K1P1/4N3/8 w - -',Here I make an inaccuracy. Another lesson for me: just because I have a good plan it's a good idea to see if there's something better. Better was 58. ...Bg5+! cutting off the white king from the queenside unless white wastes extra tempos to get back over there. After ...Bg5+ I could then pick off the pawn and white's king would be positioned really poorly.
365,12,53,h4,b'8/4b3/1p6/p3k3/2P3pp/1n1K2P1/4N3/8 w - -',Time to make reality the threats that white can't possibly cover.
366,12,54,g3,b'8/8/1p6/4k3/1NPn3b/p3K1p1/8/8 w - -',And now both of these threats cannot be stopped.
367,12,55,6Nd3+,b'8/8/1p6/4k3/2Pn3b/p2NK1p1/8/8 b - -',Black now has a forced mate. But it's a ways out. Fritz says it will happen in 21 moves. I think a little sooner.
368,12,56,6Nb4,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/1NPn3b/p3K1p1/8/8 b - -',I'm no longer really pondering things; the game is over. As an aside the black knight was immune again due to 66. KxN  followed by either ...a2 or ...g2.
369,12,57,6Kxd4,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/1NPK3b/p7/6p1/8 b - -',White realizes he has nothing better so grabs the knight.
370,12,58,6g1=Q+,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/1NPK3b/p7/8/6q1 w - -',Mate in 9 and this seems about right to me.
371,12,59,6Kc3,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/1NP4b/p1K5/8/6q1 b - -',From here I admit to not looking for that quickest way to mate. White plays just a little longer.
372,12,60,6Be1+,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/1NP5/p1K5/8/4b1q1 w - -',A queen check was Fritz's choice here but it hardly matters.
373,12,61,Bxb4,b'8/8/1p6/5k2/KbP5/p3q3/8/8 w - -',And white finally resigns as his obvious hopes I'd blunder something away to a knight fork is no longer a possibility. I don't blame him for not resigning sooner considering the terrible blunder of mine on move 15. Laters everyone. ;)

379,13,5,1Qd2,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/4p2p/q1pp4/2PP1B2/P1n1PN2/3Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Yes of course black knight gets tied. It is not fatal but black now have to play accurately to avoid further problems.
380,13,6,1cxd4,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/4p2p/q2p4/2Pp1B2/P1n1PN2/3Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This is mistake. The main problem for black here was to release the tied knight c3 and this could be done by 11... Nc6. After 12. dxc5 Ne4 13. Qxa5 Nxa5 14. cxd5 exd5 15. Rc1 white regain the pawn but the position is still slightly better for black. And now white knight arrives to d4 and black can't release the c3 knight. They find another trick but are unable to avoid major problems.
381,13,7,e5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/7p/q3p3/2BN1B2/P1n1P3/3Q1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',This pawn fork for knight d4 and bishop f4 lets black to regain the piese but problems for them come from another side.
382,13,8,1Nb3,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/7p/q3p3/2B2B2/PNn1P3/3Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',The black queen has to retreat leaving knigth c3 to its fate.
383,13,9,1Qxg7,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pQ1/1q5p/8/2B2p2/PN2P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',The king's wing of the black position is damaged and what is worse black king's position is exposed which is really dangerous here.
384,13,10,f3,b'rnb1kr2/pp3pQ1/1q5p/8/2B5/PN2Pp2/5PPP/R4RK1 w q -',This looks necessary because otherwise white could play exf4 and the line e gets opened for frontal attacks against the king. From the other side black pieces are undeveloped and spending precious time to move the pawn is also very dangerous. I don't know what continuation here would be the best for black but it is obvious that the bad times for them are coming.
385,13,11,fxg2,b'rnb1kr2/pp3pQ1/1q5p/8/2BN4/P3P3/5PpP/R4RK1 w q -',More one black pawn move while white uses every opportunity to develop their pieces is fatal. At that moment I was sure that I'm 100% winning. And without 18... fxg2 I was going to continue 19. Nxf3 geting both material and great positional advantage which would be absolutely sufficient for victory. And in postgame analysis Rybka shows here that black fails in all variations.
386,13,12,1Rfd1,b'rnb1kr2/pp3pQ1/1q5p/8/2BN4/P3P3/5PpP/R2R2K1 b q -',"Nice position - almost all white pieces are already in the game while neither black pieces except the queen started to play. Black king is vulnerable from any direction and its white opponent looks absolutely safe. Black pawn g2 is an excellent defender like sincere friend making impossible for black to hit it in frontal attack it looks even better defender than the white pawn :-). At that monent I was sure that black will be smashed in five moves or so. 
But imagine black queen on g5 and black knight on f3 - this is mate :-(. No this can't ever happen - black will be smashed soon!"
387,13,13,2Rac1,b'rnb1kr2/pp3pQ1/7p/2q5/2BN4/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b q -',Black's position is absolutely lost the most obvious threat for them is 21... Bb5+. Computer shows that black are defeated in all variations the problem for white player is only to find best continuations of the attack. But starting at this point my opponent played briliantly finding the strongest move which can't be said about me...
388,13,14,2Nd7,b'r1b1kr2/pp1n1pQ1/7p/2q5/2BN4/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 w q -',The threat 21. Bb7 is not actual any more. White can't play neither 21. Bxf7+ because of 21... Rxf7 22. Qg8+ Qf8. 
389,13,15,2Nb5,b'r1b1kr2/pp1n1pQ1/7p/1Nq5/2B5/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b q -',The best continuation creating new threats for example 21... a6 22. Nd6+ Ke7 23. Bxf7 Qe5 24. Nxc8+ Raxc8 25. Rxd7+ Kxd7 26. Qxe5 or 21... Ke8 22. Qxf8+ Nxf8 23. Nxb8++ and Nxc5. 
390,13,16,2Ke7,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkpQ1/7p/1Nq5/2B5/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 w - -',Excellent defence wery hard to find causing white the hardest problems to continue the attack. All threats created by the preceding play aren't actual now because Bxf7 goes without a check.
391,13,17,2Nd6,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkpQ1/3N3p/2q5/2B5/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b - -',This is good move but not the best. The threat Bxf7 is still dangerous but not mortal. The best continuation as Rybka shows would be 22. Rd5! which prevents black queen to get to  g5 square. The further play at this case could be 22... Qb6 23. Nd5 a6 24. Nf5+ Ke8 25. Rd6 Qa7 26. Bxf7+ Rxf7 27. Re6+ Kd8 28. Qxf7 and white wins. Computer shows that white still wins but finding the way to the victory is more tricky now.
392,13,18,2Qg5,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkpQ1/3N3p/6q1/2B5/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 w - -',Black queen gets to the g5 square does this remind you something? No don't mind white still wins in all variations.
393,13,19,2Qd4,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkp2/3N3p/6q1/2BQ4/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b - -',This would be bad idea to excange queens here right?
394,13,20,2Ne5,b'r1b2r2/pp2kp2/3N3p/4n1q1/2BQ4/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 w - -',"wow what a nigthmare black knight is going to jump to f3 - and black wins! And what about attack I just haved such strong position!
Computer shows that white still wins but don't speak about smashing black in five moves."
395,13,21,2Nxc8+,b'r1N2r2/pp2kp2/7p/4n1q1/2BQ4/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b - -',This is good move and white still going to win but the best move would be 24. Be2 Re8 25. f4 Qg6 26. Qxe5 and white wins very soon.
396,13,22,2Qd6+,b'r1r5/pp2kp2/3Q3p/4n1q1/2B5/P3P3/5PpP/2RR2K1 b - -',Right idea white first comes out of the knight fork Nf3 and besides all black king is getting again in very vulnerable place.
397,13,23,2f4,b'r1r1k3/pp3p2/3Q3p/4n1q1/2B2P2/P3P3/6pP/2RR2K1 b - f3',It is again good move but not the best. Better would be first 26. Bb5+ Rc6 27. Bxc6+ bxc6 (or 27... Nxc6? 28. Rxc6 Rd8 29. Qxd8+ Qxd8 30. Rxd8+ Kxd8 31. Rxh6) and only now 28. f4. Please also note that if bishop stayed on e2 (see previous comment) f4 would be even stronger.
398,13,24,Qh5,b'r1r1k3/pp3p2/3Q3p/7q/2B2P2/P3Pn2/5KpP/2RR4 w - -',Computer shows that white still wins but I was already discouraged by continuous efforts not bringing me success - and I was going to smash black in five moves. I encountered the position which seemed before like unrealistic nightmare and I still have material disadvantage. Now I decided to go the way which gives me small but reliable advantage 
399,13,25,2Bxf7+,b'r1r1k3/pp3B2/3Q3p/7q/5P2/P3Pn2/5KpP/2RR4 b - -',- and this turnes out to be mistake. If I played 28. Rd5 the victory could be easily achievable: 28... g1Q+ 29. Rxg1 Nxg1 30. Rxh5; 28... Qg4 (the only move black doesn't loose the knight immediately) 29. Bb5+ Rc6 30. Bxc6+ bxc6 31. Qxc6+ Ke7 32. Qb7+ Kf6 33. Rd6+ Kg7 34. Qxf6 - not very hard to be found. So while black made the best moves to defend I made simply good not the best moves to attack - but this is not enough to win.
400,13,26,3Rxc1,b'r3k3/pp3q2/3Q3p/8/5P2/P3PK2/6pP/2R5 b - -',I got only material equality but I had a hope to achieve advantage by winning the pawn g2 which sometimes looked like my sincere frend and best defender. But even so it is queens endgame where one pawn advantage is often not sufficient to win. So my victory is questionable now. Very discouraging...
401,13,27,g1=Q+,b'r3k3/pp6/3Q3p/7q/5P2/P3P3/5K1P/2R3q1 w - -',Unexpected but reasonable move. The main task for white now is to escape from checks. I considered continuation 31... Qh4+ 32. Kg1 where it is not a problem and taking into account that black king is in exposed position I hoped to win. As Rybka showed 31... g1Q+ is the strongest defence. Now I had to decide should the new queen be taken by king or rooch.
402,13,28,3Kxg1,b'r3k3/pp6/3Q3p/7q/5P2/P3P3/7P/2R3K1 b - -',I took by king and this again turns out to be mistake. I did not find how if the rooch takes to escape from checks but computer showed that the way existed although being very tricky: 32. Rxg1 Qxh2 33. Rg2 Qh4+ 34. Ke2 Qh5+ 35. Kd2! Qa5+! (35... Rd8? 36. Rg8+) 36. Kd3 Qb5+ 37. Ke4 Qa4+ 38. Kf5 king escapes and black can't save their king - white should win. 
403,13,29,3Qe5+,b'3rk3/pp6/7p/4Q3/5Pq1/P3P3/5K1P/2R5 b - -',The last hope - after 34... Kf8 35. Qh8+ Kf7 36. Rc7+ white wins but black avoids this point.
404,13,30,3Qc3,b'3r2k1/ppR5/7p/8/5Pq1/P1Q1P3/5K1P/8 b - -',It is all the draw is now inevitable.

So you have all enjoyed my near-miss victory against Pitroque (Charles)!  So by the grace of God I kept my Class A rating.  Happily and slightly more convincingly I found myself taking another two steps on the Yellow Brick Road towards the Kingdom of Expertdom.  We ended up in the endgame mentioned above where I had the pieces and Andy had the rook.  So how did this all happen?  Well read on ......."
513,16,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. e3      - I usually open with e4 so this is a thematic mini-tournament based on the Stonewall System.  This MT arose from two unrated games between Brigadecommander (Janet) and Stalhandske (Torsten).  Well here is the start of the stonewalling.
514,16,2,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',6. f4 - after some rapid piece development on both sides this move sets up the Stonewall.  It is very hard for either side to get a result but sometimes these breakthroughs do happen!

A further bit of consolidation to my  queenside pawns is needed - i.e. I need to get my a pawn away from Andy's lsb before I can get my rook into play.

My rook now gets traded in for Andy's two pieces and the g2 pawn.  This will result in me having two pieces and a pawn against a rook.  Although it depends on the position and Coach Ion managed a victory with the rook more times than not the two pieces are better.

Pawns are the soul of chess!  They are certainly not to be taken lightly.  They are potential queens.  If you are able to keep a one pawn advantage all the way through it can therefore be decisive.  It certainly was in this game!  For the want of three rating points I would have clocked up only my third near-Expert Victory.  All the same it was a big win because William absolutely Blitzed me (pun intended!) in my first game as white against him.  In the second I got away with a Houdini-Style draw.  In this game however the position looked even until I somehow managed to win a pawn in the middlegame.  God only knows how I managed to hold on to this precious one point advantage but I did.  Pieces were exchanged and I ended up in a Q & P ending with an outside passer.  Even in such an advantageous position Glenda just could not stop defending right to the end.  However she was nursing my a pawn through to becoming Glenda2.  William could not stop this promotion and resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So how did this all happen?  Well let us start with the Reti Opening which is 1. Nf3."

He can trade his queen for the pawn but that still leaves Glenda on the board.  Either way William will be a queen to the bad and Old Matey isn't too far away.  Thankfully my games level is gradually reducing and I am able to spend more time analysing my games and getting into a ""Freeze Funk"" less and less and I am having more time to make my moves.

A good way for white to make a comeback of sorts from here on out is to reactivate the queen. If this were me I'd move the queen back to d3. This both protects the rook and forces black out. Then either you exchange queens (black does Qxd3 and rook takes the black queen) or else black moves the queen somewhere else and white regains control. "

Since I don't know the continuation of the Karo Can after 1...d5 I decided to do something different and unusual.  For me this is actually unheard of.  It's a case of copy what your opponent does in the opening.  And by that I'm alluding to the move.  Since he moved his d pawn I was going to do the same thing.

The reason being is that since everything is even I enjoy going into early exchanges with much stronger opponents.  Believe it or not this prevents me from feeling overwhelmed and being overwhelmed has triggered a ""Fight or Flight"" response in some of my games causing me to move way too quickly.  Exchanging however actually gives me more confidence and optimism then I need.  So I essentially get a very good game from that on a normal basis."

The only other choice would have been ...Be7.  The only thing is that both of them block his own center since the e and f files are considered center squares.  But in this position it's well worth the effort as I'm getting ready to castle.  In fact as we're about to see this what black will do immediately.  The reason I'm even more obsessed about this then normal is because of what I noted earlier.  Right now my K is vulnerable but that vulnerability will end once I tuck the monarch away.
856,26,9,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',So he's now continuing with development.

Here's the thing in chess one of the goals is to figure if you've made an error and if so it's about correcting your mistake.  In fact this is why Jack Stockel would say ""Try to figure out a way out of trouble.""  This is a good example."
858,26,11,Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQ -',Unless there's something I'm missing there is nothing for white to worry about.  And there's no way for him to win material yet.  So I don't know why my opponent decided to bring his Q out before everything else was developed.  Because of that I feel that he now has a weakness which I will try to take advantage of if possible.
859,26,12,Re8+,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',It starts off by putting him under pressure with this check.  At first actually thought that this move would take away his castling rights and possibly expose his K.  Although I was incorrect there is absolutely nothing wrong with this move.  Since I will still be able to continue developing without any compromises on my position then there's nothing for me to be worried about.  
860,26,13,Ne2,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"A good and developing way for white to get out of my check.  So at least this didn't pressure.

861,26,14,Bg4,b'rn1qr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P2b1/2PB4/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',So I decide to start by attacking his N.  That's because I kept in mind that it's already pinned by my R.  Since I'm not completely sure my goal is to create a weakness for white in order to take advantage of it.  It starts with my attempt to make him feel stressed.  However what I overlooked is his LSB.  This time it's not a problem but it prevents me from achieving my goal at least for now.

864,26,17,1O-O,b'rn1qr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/7b/3P4/2PB3P/PPQ1NPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Meanwhile he doesn't waste anymore to castle.  Unlike before however I will exchange his N for my B.  Right now his Knight is worth more then my B because it's strong.  Since it's no longer pinned it can do a lot of damage.  I know because I analyzed the situation and have seen this kind of position with Jack Stockel.  In fact about two years ago this is how I lost a game against my coach.
865,26,18,Qe7,b'rn2r1k1/pp2qppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2P4P/PPQ1BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',After all was said done now my goal is to win his LSB which is why I played this.  So how did I come up with this move?  Well I studied a game between GM's Judit Polgar and Anand.  In that game Judit won.  One way she did this was also putting pressure on the e file.  By doing this she prevented her opponent from castling and then some.  She did this by doubling up both of her R's and Q on the e file with the Queen in front.  So I sort of decided to do the same thing here using the same idea here but in a different scenario and position.  Either way this move is going to give me an edge.  
866,26,19,1Bd3,b'rn2r1k1/pp2qppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB3P/PPQ2PP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',"And this is how he responds.  Ironically however after this move white resigns.  Reason: well he probably saw something that I was trying to do.  What was that?  Well I am trying to mate white by sacking my Q.  The idea was 13...Qe1 14.Rxe1 Rxe1#.  BTW I got this idea from a game between GM's Judit Polgar and Karpov.  That's because Judit actually defeated Karpov with a Q sac during the endgame.  However black does not have a mating because my opponent and I both overlooked white's LSB.  So 13...Qe1?? does not lead to mate.  Instead it would be a losing blunder for black.  How?  14.Rxe1 and after 14...Rxe1 15.Bf1.  So black would lose the Q for a R.  Even if his LSB weren't there white would still have a way to avoid mate if 14.Qd1.  However despite what I overlooked I knew all along that my opponent could just bring his Q to d1.  So on that ground I thought that resignation was premature.  However tactical_abyss disagreed with that assessment.  In it he said ""The open file is a tactic I employ on a regular basiswith my Rook.Your win against a much stronger opponent proves my point that certain kinds of tactics can bring down an opponent very quickly.""  So the moral of this story is that there are occasions where trying something that you're not used to is a key to success and a way to make progress.      "
