7,0,7,1Nxb5,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/3pp3/nN4Bq/3P4/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White has a double threat here. The threat of Nc7 winning the rook and Qxa5 winning a knight.

27,1,14,Re8,b'4r1k1/7p/p1p3p1/8/3p2b1/6q1/2P3B1/5QKR w - -',32. ........... Re8 - take a look at white everyone this position looks resignable and I was resigned to losing 7 rating points.  It looks resignable because I have lost 4 pawns my bishop is horribly pinned and it looks as though my queen is going to be pinned too.  I have one last throw of the dice however.

32,1,19,Kf6,b'4Q3/7p/p1p2kp1/4r3/6b1/6q1/2P3B1/6KR w - -',41. ........ Kf6 - if black had played her king to d6 I would have taken off the c pawn (another pawn back) with 42. Qxc6 .  The king would have been forced back to the second rank where my rook would have got in on the act by winning back another pawn with check.  All my moves have to be checks or the Sword of Damocles descends from e5.  With the queen and rook working together in tandem it looks as if it will be black who cops Old Matey instead - but black plays Kf6.
33,1,20,4Qf8+,b'5Q2/7p/p1p2kp1/4r3/6b1/6q1/2P3B1/6KR b - -',42.  Qf8  - I now feel 100% sure my opponent cannot escape the checks.  I therefore offer her a draw.  I have an extremely anxious half an hour or so of clicking on the refresh button!  Finally the message comes in.  Game drawn.  Wheeew!

I write comments for the White pieces and Pawnbandit commentates for the Black pieces..I have some comments for black as well. To make this easy I will put Pawnbandits comments in brackets.

37,2,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 is line for the 3rd move for white. Takes some squares in the center as well as guarding the h4 square.
38,2,4,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',This seems to be the berlin defense. I'm not positive. It was definitely the favorite for black in this tournament.

41,2,7,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the best move for white. Anything else is trapped

The title of it is nothing more than a reflection of the rivalry I share with my mate Blackbaron. Although Blackbaron and myself average out at similar ratings he always seems to be significantly ahead of me in games won.

But this would then tie up my two remaining major pieces and probably result in a pawn-fight on the kingside.

Black is now able to fianchetto the light squared bishop placing it on an EXCELLENT diagonal directed at my kingside. I rather like Black's position with the exception of Black not having any central space. I'm second guessing my plan to castle kingside due to the bishop coming to b7 and Black's knight and queen both being able to reach that area very quickly. 7. Be3 strengthens my center and gets me closer to the option of castling queenside.


(theinnergame) b5 is not just preventing an attack on f7;it's a ready made attack if you castle queenside."

It seems to be Black's best minor piece and is FAR superior to my light squared bishop. Putting my light squared bishop on f3 would solve the problem Black's bishop won't be able to move away due to being pinned to the a8 rook. To make that happen I need to move my f3 Knight to a different square. e5 looks good to me it is central and I can't see any tactics for Black that would exploit the knight on this square.

Attacked twice but only defended once. I can either defend it again move it to safety or exchange it for a Black piece. Bf4 defends the knight a second time and gives the potential for a discovered attack against the Black queen but the bishop will be undefended. I don't see any good squares to move the knight to safety. I don't want to exchange my knight for Black's d7 knight because my knight is on a better square and trading pieces will help to relieve the cramp on Black's position. Bf4 seems like my best bet.

This is considered the main opening for the majority of GMs as White stakes out his claim to the centre. This is my normal opening I decided not to change this as it is my fave and I'm not gonna try and do anything to drastic to bamboozle the computer until I've seen how good it is. 

I don't like boring openings which in my opinion is almost everything apart from 1.e4. After 1.e4 there are loads of fun and wild gambits! Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players there is always 1. Nf3 controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure.

Jester on the other hand has a weakened pawn structure with chinks on d6 and h6 he's in a very passive position overprotecting d4 and has no realistic attacking plans apart from maybe putting a rook on g8 and pawnstorming the kingside.

And when i played Nf6 to to Nh4 to Nf5. The sqaures that it lands on in between it's target destinations are normally not very strong 
squares these are the maneuvering or pivot points but the places they move to are normally quite effective outposts eg Nf5. Make sure thjough that the piece you are maneuvering doesn't get stuck on the passive pivot square where it can't affect the game.

My first impression is that Jester is not very good at  playing possitional chess it tends to play passive  chess. and when it is on the backfoot it doesn't defend well. It does however play well when attacking as it is very good at calculations and tactical combos. Although that isn't clear in this game if you play a blitz with jester yourself this will become clear. I'll annotate my next game with Jester ""The strongest pure java chess program"" on ://www.ludochess.com/ here on GK. The battle of Man vs Machine has begun it's 1-0 to Man!

I hope you enjoyed this game as much as I did playing it. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why leave a comment or PM.
Thanks

And in fact he'd probably play 10. ...Be6 and white is not sure to take any advantage of black's uncomfortable king-side position.

816,39,18,2c3,b'4r3/4bprp/pk2p3/1p2N3/8/2P5/PP4PP/2KRR3 b - -',I really enjoyed what black does here......
817,39,19,2Kc2,b'4r3/5prp/pk2p3/1p2N1b1/8/2P5/PPK3PP/3RR3 b - -',king onto white square important when playing against 1 bishop.
818,39,20,Bc7,b'4r3/2b3rp/pk2pp2/1p6/8/2P2NP1/PPK4P/3RR3 w - -',best place for bishop to be prevents Rd6  getting his bishop there was simple but also very elegant. (i appreciate nice moves like that whatever the rating whoever the player)
819,39,21,2Nd4,b'4r3/2b3rp/pk2pp2/1p6/3N4/2P3P1/PPK4P/3RR3 b - -',alot happens from here on in. I will not comment on all only the vital ones.
820,39,22,3Kb3,b'4r3/2b4p/p1k2p2/1p2pNr1/8/1KP3P1/PP5P/3R1R2 b - -',keeps black from harrasing king and allows me to concentrate on greater prizes.
821,39,23,f5,b'5r2/2b5/p1k5/1p1Npprp/8/1KP3P1/PP5P/3R1R2 w - -',was tempted for the swap but again i had an upper hand and the bishop can only cover certain squares itself so the knight is much more valuable.
822,39,24,3Rh7,b'5r2/2b4R/p1k5/1p2pN1p/7P/1KP5/PP4r1/5R2 b - -',starting to make tempi work for me in terms of material however black now gets to take d file and strengthen his rooks position.
823,39,25,4Rb1,b'8/2b5/p1k5/1p2pN1R/7P/1KP5/PP1r2r1/1R6 b - -',ties my rook up but i still have advantage and blacks bishop is now more in the way than i would like.
824,39,26,e4,b'1R6/8/3k4/pp5P/4p3/1KP5/PP2r2r/1R6 w - -',I understand this but i think it could have waited this defeats purpose of Rh2
825,39,27,5h6,b'8/8/3k3P/pR6/8/1KP1p3/PP2r2r/1R6 b - -',attempting something cheeky :) didn't think it'd ever work but worth a shot!
826,39,28,5Reg2,b'8/8/3k3P/pR6/8/1KP1p3/PP4rr/1R6 w - -',? spoke to opponent at time. He advised this was a mistake he should have played Ref2
827,39,29,Rgf2,b'8/8/3k3P/R7/8/1KP1p3/PP3r1r/1R6 w - -',corrected at expense white in better position and far more comfortable
828,39,30,5Rg7,b'8/6R1/7P/5k2/8/1KP5/PP2pr1r/4R3 b - -',tried a few times previously trying to check king and exchange rooks.
829,39,31,5Ke6,b'8/6R1/4k2P/8/8/1KP5/PP2pr1r/4R3 w - -',black has now lost the match but this move seals it.
830,39,32,6b3,b'8/8/8/3k4/5r2/1PP5/P2KR3/8 b - -',"Black resigns and i snatch victory from the jaws of a easy defeat! 
my opening was terrible and had no right to win that match however 1 mistake and a period of tempi allows for a nice little match.
I'd like to thank my opponent for allowing a rematch to a lower rated player who should have been a easy victory!

Lessons to be learn't from this match:

Keeping tempi rocks!

and the big one: If you lose dont be sore about it smile and move on to the next game and take what you have learn't from that game. There is no need to be unpleasent and say ""your lucky"". chess i feel is about respect humility and fun.

Thanks to my opponent for the game and my motivation.

David."
