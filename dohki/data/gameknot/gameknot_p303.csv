2,0,2,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',A quiet continuation.  5. a3 is the more common move.  5. Bd2 signals white's interest in trading dark square bishops.

16,0,16,2Bh7+,b'5rk1/1p1bn1pB/p3p2p/3pP3/3N4/q3Q3/2P3PP/4R1K1 b - -',A classic clearance sacrifice where the bishop forces black to respond to the check while the queen on a3 is left hanging. 1-0.  
17,1,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The hyper-accelerated dragon Sicilian defense.  The main idea of these lines versus the usual dragon is that black wants to play d5 in one move.  In the regular dragon black plays d6 and then sometimes a later d5 costing an important tempo.
18,1,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Qxd4 is played often enough but I think it isn't as challenging.
19,1,2,Nxc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2N2np1/8/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The most challenging line in this variation of the Sicilian is 7. Bc4 0-0 8. Bb3.  I don't think 7. Be2 or 7. f3 are too challenging either.  I think some people play this line thinking that they're winning a tempo after 8. e5 but check out the position in just a few moves.
20,1,3,Ng8,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/4P3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now the e-pawn is hanging.

22,1,5,f6,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pp1bp/2p2pp1/4P3/5P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Which black attacks again.

24,1,7,1Nxf6,b'r1bqk2r/p2pp1bp/2p2np1/8/5P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now the knight is back on f6 and it isn't clear what the pawn on f4 is doing.  white hasn't won a tempo after all.
25,1,8,d5,b'r1bqk2r/p3p1bp/2p2np1/3p4/2B2P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq d6',This leave a backwards e-pawn but it gives black a chance to get castled.

27,1,10,1Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/p3p1bp/2p3p1/3p3n/3B1P2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I decided to offer to exchange the dark square bishops.  Notice also that the f4 pawn has come under attack.

30,1,13,Nxg7,b'r2q1rk1/p3p1np/2p3p1/3p4/5P2/1BN3Pb/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ -',15. ... Kxg7 was OK but I wanted to reroute the knight.  It did it's job provoking 14. g3.
31,1,14,1Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/p3p1np/2p3p1/3N4/5P2/1B4Pb/PPP4P/R2QK2R b KQ -',I dind't consider this sound during the game.
32,1,15,Qxa8,b'q4r1k/p3p1np/6p1/8/5P2/6Pb/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ -',Here's why:  White temporarily wins a rook and 2 pawns for two pieces.  Normally that's considered fair compensation.  However White's king is going to get stuck in the center and black is going to win a pawn back.  Two pieces are usually better than a rook and pawn.
33,1,16,1Rg1,b'q4r1k/p3p1np/6p1/8/5P2/6Pb/PPP4P/R2QK1R1 b Q -',The only move.

35,1,18,2c3,b'5r1k/p3p1np/6p1/8/3q1P2/2P3Pb/PP2Q2P/R3K1R1 b Q -',Oops.  Overlooking that the rook on g1 is hanging.
36,1,19,2Qxg1+,b'5r1k/p3p1np/6p1/8/5P2/2P3Pb/PP2Q2P/R3K1q1 w Q -',0-1
37,2,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French Defense. The idea is to play d5 challenging White's e-pawn. But my opponent didn't play the main variation.
38,2,1,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I don't play this anymore but the idea is to play Nd2 and keep the pawn on e4 if Black plays d5.
39,2,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Not a normal move. 2... d5 is the most common move here.
40,2,3,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',I want to prep for a pawn storm on the kingside in case Black castles there.
41,2,4,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A better idea is to play 4...c5 before developing the knight there because now I can control d4 with 5. c3.
42,2,5,Nh6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n1p1pn/8/4PP2/2PP1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An odd developing square because that knight does not have any active purpose there.
43,2,6,h3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n1p1pn/8/4PP2/2PP1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Planning g4 whenever Black castles. But Black may be afraid to castle there if I play it too early.
44,2,7,g4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pbp/2n1p1pn/8/4PPP1/2PP1N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQ g3',I'm threatening g5 winning the misplaced knight.
45,2,8,f6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp2bp/2n1pppn/8/4PPP1/2PP1N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',Gives the knight the escape square f7.
46,2,9,g5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp2bp/2n1pppn/6P1/4PP2/2PP1N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQ -',I thought I was being too hasty. I should've continued the attack slower and safer.
47,2,10,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1nbp/2n1p1p1/6P1/3PP3/2P2N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQ -',Although I have a strong centre I'm lacking in development from moving too many pawns and my kingside is overextended.

49,2,12,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2nbp/p1n1p1p1/3pP1P1/3P4/2P2N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',I wasn't sure exactly what the reason for this was.

51,2,14,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1nnbp/p3p1p1/3pP1P1/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP2Q3/RNB1K2R b KQ -',I plan to castle queenside where I have pawns to cover me.

54,2,17,1Nh8,b'r1bq1rkn/1pp1n1b1/p3p1p1/3pP1Pp/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP2Q3/RN2K2R w KQ -',Black has made 4 odd moves in a row and I should've been winning except I made a huge blunder here getting into a lost position.
55,2,18,1Nbd2,b'r1bq1rkn/1pp1n1b1/p3p1p1/3pP1Pp/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQ3/R3K2R b KQ -',15. Nbd2?? is totally losing because I hang the bishop. This is a common mistake in correspondence chess because a lot of times players will go to a game they haven't looked at for a few days and make a move without checking the position for hanging pieces or threats. 
56,2,19,1Rxf4,b'r1bq2kn/1pp1n1b1/p3p1p1/3pP1Pp/3P1r2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQ3/R3K2R w KQ -',I am totally lost in this position but miraculously I came back and won. You're probably wondering how that happened in a position like this.
57,2,20,1Nf1,b'r2q2kn/1ppbn1b1/p3p1p1/3pP1Pp/3P1r2/2PB1N1P/PP2Q3/2KR1N1R b - -',Usually the best way to try for a swindling desperate attack is to attack the king. I move my knight so that I can reach the good g6 square with a better chance to swindle Black.
58,2,21,1Qe1,b'r4qkn/1ppbn1b1/p3p1p1/3pP1Pp/3P4/2PB3P/PP3r1N/2KRQN1R b - -',My position looks terrible! A lot of my pieces are on the back rank and Black has control of the f-file. I thought for sure I would lose but I didn't resign because there were so many pieces on the board and material advantages are only useful with fewer pieces on the board.
59,2,22,2Bc2,b'r4qkn/1pp1n1b1/p3p1p1/1b1pP1Pp/3P4/2P4P/PPB2r1N/2KRQN1R b - -',Although trading bishops would take away Black's bishop pair I must avoid trading my active pieces if I want to swindle Black.
60,2,23,Rf2,b'r4qkn/1pp1n1b1/p3p1p1/1b1pP1Pp/3P4/2P3QP/PPB2r1N/2KR1N1R w - -',Black probably didn't think very much on that move. He probably thought I had no chance to win because I'm down a piece and just expected the game to win itself.
61,2,24,Rf7,b'r4qkn/1pp1nrb1/p3p1p1/1b1pP1Pp/3P4/2P1N1QP/PPB4N/2KR3R w - -',Why is Black retreating? He must think I'm going to resign any move now.

Now I'm the one with all the active mobil pieces and Black is the one with the cramped position. And material advantages are less useful in cramped positions so I'm not really ""totally"" losing. Just losing."
63,2,26,2Rhf1,b'r4qkn/1pp1nrb1/p1b1p1p1/3pP1Pp/P2P4/2P1N1QP/1PB4N/2KR1R2 b - -',I challenge the f-file.

65,2,28,b5,b'r4qkn/2p1nrb1/2b1p1p1/pp1pP1Pp/P2P4/2P1NNQP/1PB5/2KR1R2 w - b6',Black wants to open up files to my king but he doesn't have very many active pieces there so I am not worried. I have lots of active pieces on the kingside so I should mainly focus there.
66,2,29,2Nh4,b'r4qkn/2p1nrb1/2b1p1p1/pp1pP1Pp/P2P3N/2P1N1QP/1PB5/2KR1R2 b - -',I am eyeing the weak g-pawn.

68,2,31,2Qf3,b'r1q3kn/2p1n1b1/2b1p1p1/pp1pP1Pp/P2P3N/2P1NQ1P/1PB5/2K2R2 b - -',I don't care about losing my a-pawn because I'm already down a piece and a pawn won't make much difference. If I take the pawn then Black can attack much faster and I don't have time for my swindling attempt on the kingside.
69,2,32,2Neg2,b'r1q3kn/2p1n1b1/2b1p1p1/p2pP1Pp/p2P3N/2P2Q1P/1PB3N1/2K2R2 b - -',I am headed for f4 where I attack the weak g-pawn. The key to getting a successful kingside attack is to first attack the pawns.
70,2,33,Bf7,b'r1q3kn/2p1nbb1/4p1p1/p2pP1Pp/p2P1N1N/2P2Q1P/1PB5/2K2R2 w - -',"Another wasted move. Black doesn't want to work for his win and wants it to be handed to him. Black has an attack going on the queenside and should've tried piling his heavy pieces on the b-file.

Don't let distractions like that keep you from carrying out your intended plans.
72,2,35,3c5,b'r1q3kn/4nbb1/4p1p1/p1ppP1Pp/p2P1N1N/2PQ3P/1PB5/2K2R2 w - c6',Black is underestimating my swindling chances and thinks anything he does will win because he has an extra piece and pawn.
73,2,36,3Nxh5,b'r1q3kn/4nbb1/4p1p1/p1ppP1PN/p2P3N/2PQ3P/1PB5/2K2R2 b - -',If Black takes then I will play Qh7  and g6 which gives me a lot more swindling chances than if he doesn't take my knight.
74,2,37,3Nf5,b'r1q3kn/5bb1/4p1p1/p1ppPnPN/p2P3N/2PQ3P/1PB5/2K2R2 w - -',Black is realizing now that I still have chances to win and must neutralize these chances and win with his extra piece in the endgame.
75,2,38,3Nxg7,b'r1q3kn/5bN1/4p1p1/p1ppPnP1/p2P3N/2PQ3P/1PB5/2K2R2 b - -',It isn't good to trade when you're down material but Black was threatening both my knights so a trade was forced and trading on f5 solidifies Black's kingside lessening my swindling chances.

81,2,44,3Nxh4,b'r1q4n/5bk1/4pNp1/p1ppP1P1/p2P3n/2PQ4/1PB5/2K2R2 w - -',A terrible move. If Black doesn't take the pawn and just keeps the knight on f5 then I have no chance to win and Black is up a piece. Black probably greedily took the pawn without a second thought and is amazed that I haven't resigned yet.
82,2,45,3Qh3,b'r1q4n/5bk1/4pNp1/p1ppP1P1/p2P3n/2P4Q/1PB5/2K2R2 b - -',Black is in big trouble and may even be losing here but his next move was a definite blunder which hands me a winning position.

A worse move option for White is dxc5 which gives Black a slight advantage and then it's White who is fighting for equality.

120,4,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I challenge White's pawn again. Forcing him to defend with e4 or c4. Other moves for White aren't good because he moved his d-pawn twice and must keep the pawn on d5 by defending with another pawn. Otherwise the tempi used advancing the d-pawn will be a waste.
121,4,4,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This move is the sharpest leading to an unbalanced sharp tactical game while defending with e4 is more dull and drawish.

189,6,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',"One of several good moves. Other good moves are 2...g6 2...d6 2...e6 and 2...Nf6. 
I play 2...Nf6 because I like the sharp unbalanced battles that arise after 2...Nf6 e5 d5 exf6 dxc4 fxg7 Bxg7 because I am leading in development but my doubled c-pawns could become a weakness. "
190,6,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I need to control d5 as much as possible because in this opening it is common for Black to play e6 Ne7 d5 gaining space in the centre and making my bishop move again.
191,6,5,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This move adds to Black's control of the central dark squares and g6 Bg7 does the same. I recommend g6 Bg7 in this position because it aids in castling along with control of the dark squares. The move d6 should only be played if extra control of e5 is needed or if Black needs to develop his queen's bishop.
192,6,6,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',This is the Grand Prix Attack. I rarely play this opening as White but will if I am playing a low rated player or someone who knows my normal c3 opening. I never studied it so most of my experience came from when I play against this opening as Black.
193,6,7,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq e6',This move may appear strong to amateurs because Black is clearly dominating the dark squares but he has given me a spot on d5 where I can keep a piece in his territory and he cannot chase it away with a pawn.
194,6,8,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',"5. fxe5? is a bad move even though it gives up an f-pawn for a more important d-pawn it gives Black an open d-file and I need my f-pawn because a common move in this opening is to play f5 gaining space on the kingside and maybe following up with g4 h4 then g5.
So f5 was a good move in this position but I played d3 because I wanted Black to take on f4 giving me a more mobil and better developed position. But f5 was better because Black has usually played g6 stopping f5."

But I wasn't very experienced playing this opening as White. Here Black should've played Bg4 because after trading on f3 Black has control of d4 giving me complications.

293,9,28,2Qh6+,b'2r2k2/p2qnp2/1p2pB1Q/3pPp2/P2P3P/2R5/5PPK/8 b - -',Black resigns as after Kg8  Qg7 mate and after Ke8 Qh8 Ng8 Qxg8 mate. This game is a good game showing how sometimes the best way to refute a gambit is to decline it. If black declined the c2 pawn in this game the endgame would of been about equal but instead he got snared in the attack. Also remember if you have a big attack look for mate before accepting material.

Qd2 followed by 10. 0-0-0 as my play is all on the queenside and with the White rook on f1 one tempo earlier White has the opportunity to begin his attack earlier.

This game has turned into a race for activity and White is just sitting on the back ranks waiting for Black to improve his position.  White has several ways to improve his position ideas such as Bd3 Qh5 and Rf3 would induce some weakness around the Black king.

Safer but far less sexy was [7.Bd2 Bxd2 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3!? Nce7] with even chances (albeit a little passive for white).

471,17,26,2Rxe7+,b'r1r1k3/pp1qR2p/5pp1/3p2N1/6Q1/8/PP3PPP/2R3K1 b - -',!! POW!! If he retakes with his queen black loses all material because of the double attack on c8 which forces exchanges with vicious checks. Then the white knight simply mops up. If he retakes with his king white plays 23.Re1  forcing 23...Kd8 which followed by 24.Ne6  which wins.
472,17,27,2Kf8,b'r1r2k2/pp1qR2p/5pp1/3p2N1/6Q1/8/PP3PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Forced and even a little devious. Black is hoping that white jumps all over his queen so he can force a back row mate by playing Rxc1#.

480,18,2,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/4N3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',More precise was Ng5. On e5 the knight just loses a tempo and in my opinion is completly illogical because now the main idea connected with f3 is not possible.

486,18,8,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n1pn2/3p4/2NP4/2PB1Q2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',The idea behind this move was simply gaining more tempi forcing the knight and the queen to move and to create an isolated pawn as we can see in this sample variation: 11.Ne5Nxe5; 12.dxe5 Ne4; Probably is also good 10....e5; 11.d5 e4; 12.Bxe4 Ne5; 13.Nxe5 dxe5; and black's pieces are extremely active.

12.Qd1 exd4; 13.cxd4 Nxd4; 14.Bxh7  Kxh7; 15.Qxd4 should be still in black favour.
But probably is the best because other queen moves let black gain another pawn without compensation."

493,18,15,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/8/3pn3/5Bn1/2PB4/PP2Q1PP/RN3RK1 b - -',any move loses here. I can't calculate a decent variation for white

566,22,2,1f4,b'r2qk2r/5pbp/p1npb3/1p1Np2Q/4Pp2/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',This move is critisized by maybe the greatest Svesh expert GM Rogozenko. He says that black should not close the position in the centre since white can now break with g3 at a convenient time.

570,22,6,2Rb6,b'5rk1/5pb1/pR1p1q1p/3PpP1Q/8/P2B2P1/5P2/6K1 b - -',I was very happy with this position: I have to do something dramatic to manage to lose and playing for a win is fully possible. We are playing for two results as the Russian chesschool would say.
571,22,7,Ra8,b'r2q1k2/R4pb1/3p3p/p2PpP2/P3B1Q1/6P1/5PK1/8 w - -',Okey so I didn't manage to do anything with the rook maybe I can try the queen and bishop endgame?
572,22,8,3Qc6+,b'4k3/1q4b1/2Qp1p1p/p2PpP2/P3B3/6P1/5PK1/8 b - -',I thought this was good but afterwards I admit that playing with the queens on would've given more winning chances.
573,22,9,d5,b'4k3/6b1/2P2p1p/p2ppP2/P3B3/6P1/5PK1/8 w - -',!! Maybe not a difficult move for such a strong player as vortx but for more casual players this is worth noting: Black's terribly weak bishop must be activated even at the cost of a pawn. This move saves the draw.
574,22,10,4Bf7+,b'4kb2/5B2/2P2p1p/p3pP2/P7/6P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Hmm a free bishop...

578,22,14,5Kg4,b'8/2k5/2P5/p4P2/P5Kp/4pBb1/8/8 b - -',The game will finish in a draw: 50...e2 51.Bxe2 Kxc6 52.f6 Kd7  and the king rushes to block the pawn with a easy draw. In the game I thought black would win the a4-pawn so maybe I should've played on. As a good rule: Always play to checkmate or only kings left!
579,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Going into this game I didn't know what to expect from white.  Looking at white's (short) game history he looked like a ~1300 player but it's hard to tell with the opponents he was playing.
580,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I did my usual king's pawn response.
581,23,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White plunges into main line Sicilian.

583,23,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Chase the queen a little.
584,23,5,Qe3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Good place to hide the queen except for the king/rook/queen fork it creates on c2.
585,23,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I though long and hard about this move.  I was *really* tempted to play either Nb4 or Qa5  in an attempt to get that king/queen fork but in the end I decided that any strategy that relies on my opponent making a mistake is a bad strategy.  Instead I cautiously fall back into king's indian.  I lead with the knight instead of the queen's pawn because e5 is met with Ng4 costing white the pawn.
586,23,7,b3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White prepares to fianchetto the dark bishop.

588,23,9,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3pP3/8/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Another weak move.  As I noted before it loses the pawn to Ng4.
589,23,10,Ng4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/6n1/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',After 7. Qe2 Nxe5 I'm left in control of the center.  White is also left with his queen in front of his king on a half open file...
590,23,11,Bf4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pn3/5B2/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',Another weak move.  Not only is it not a pin but it's reversible.
591,23,12,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n3n1/3p4/5B2/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',Now the white bishop is in jeopardy my knight's of out reach of a pin and I'm lined up for e5.  I did screw up the king's indian but I had already strayed from that path when I saw that I could take the center.

602,23,23,1Qd6,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3q2n1/4pb2/3p4/1P3NP1/P1nBKPBP/RN1Q3R w kq -',If I can get a queen or bishop onto the a6-f1 diagonal it's mate.  I have no chance with the bishop but I can do it with the queen in two moves.  The trick is doing it without making it obvious what I'm doing.  Qd6 lines me up for Qa6   while keeping the focus on the king side.  It also keeps the focus on the black squares insead of the white diagonal.  As an added bonus Qa6   is not vulerable to a random a4 like Qb5   is.  My hope was that white would be so concerned with a3 his queen's rook and my d and e pawns that he would fail to notice the mating diagonal.  And even if white did catch on the only safe move is Kf1 trapping his rook behind a wall of pieces.
603,23,24,1Ne1,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3q2n1/4pb2/3p4/1P4P1/P1nBKPBP/RN1QN2R b kq -',As I hoped white failed to see the mating diagonal.  Instead he makes a valiant effort to make me pay for the queen's rook with my knight while at the same time opening up his bishop to attack my unguarded b pawn.  Aside from the part where it was the move that lost the game it was a really nice play.
604,23,25,1Qa6+,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/q5n1/4pb2/3p4/1P4P1/P1nBKPBP/RN1QN2R w kq -',It is now mate in 1.  Either we have 16. Kf3 e4   or 16. Nd3 Qxd3  .

606,23,27,1e4#,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/q5n1/5b2/3pp3/1P3KP1/P1nB1PBP/RN1QN2R w kq -',Checkmate with no significant pieces captured and only four pawns removed.
607,24,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I played this game at the Norwalk Championships. It shows the dangers of castling on the wrong side of the board.
608,24,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"The Alekhine Defense.
Black wants to lure my pawns to attack his knight causing me to overextend my position."
609,24,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Most people play 2. e5 here but I didn't study the Alekhine back then so I preferred the safer Nc3 over the sharper e5. A lot of times playing Nc3 will transpose into other openings less familiar to an Alekhine player.
610,24,3,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',2...d5 is a more common move. Black can also play 2...e5 transposing into a double king-pawn position.
611,24,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',But Black's d6 move has simply transposed into the Pirc Defense.
612,24,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This variation of the Pirc is somewhat passive. Black's sharpest plan is to play Nbd7 and e5 then fianchetto the king's bishop transposing into a King's Indian Defense-type formation but where I don't have a pawn on c4.
613,24,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I usually develop my bishop to e3 in this opening but I would have to play f3 first to avoid Ng4.

615,24,8,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1nppp1/2pp1n1p/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I thought it was okay for Black to play e5 here because after 6. fxe5 dxe5 7. dxe5 Nxe5 8. Qxd8 Kxd8 9. O-O-O  Kc7 Black's position is fine and my isolated e-pawn may be a problem in the resulting endgame.
616,24,9,Bxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1nppp1/2pp1B1p/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Bh4 still allows e5 and I did not want that. I want to play e5 before Black does.
617,24,10,Nxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2pp1n1p/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black lets me play e5 because gxf6 gives my queen the good h5 square where I can control the 5th rank along with my pawns. And exf6 brings the e-pawn to the f-file where Black can no longer play e5 also f7 becomes vulnerable after Bc4.
618,24,11,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2pp1n1p/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Although Black is no longer threatening e5 I must take dynamic action because in the Pirc Defense White needs to crush Black's passive position before Black finishes development and gets equality.
619,24,12,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3nP3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Nd7 cramps Black's position.
620,24,13,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3nP3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Not the best move because usually you should only develop your bishop to c4 if Black's e-pawn is gone or has passed e6 because then you are pressuring f7.
621,24,14,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p1b2p/3nP3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',I thought e6 was more solid but Be6 is more agressive.
622,24,15,1Bxd5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p1b2p/3BP3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',I don't like my misplaced bishop.
623,24,16,1Nf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3bP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',After Bxf3 gxf3 both sides should castle queenside resulting in an equal game where Black focuses on undermining my advanced central pawns and I focus on attacking the newly opened g-file.

627,24,20,1Qd3,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/3bP3/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',I am waiting for Black to castle so now I am prepping my attack.
