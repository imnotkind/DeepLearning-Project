As others have commented the English Attack (featuring Be3 and f3) is now the main line.  Once again I shall refer extensively to John Nunn's book ""The Complete Najdorf: 6 Bg5""."
409,18,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Although the Najdorf's 5...a6 is supposed to prepare the central thrust 6...e5 I've never seen it played against 6. Bg5 so I haven't tried it myself.  As it doesn't even appear in Nunn's book or in the later Nunn's Chess Openings (NCO) published in 1999 I think I'm probably right!  6... Nc6 would transpose to the Richter-Rauzer line.  Black adopts the more flexible Scheveningen formation.
410,18,3,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black's main alternatives at this point are the Polugaevsky Variation and The Poisoned Pawn: the Polu has an immediate 7...b5 which avoids putting the bishop on e7 where it often proves vulnerable.  Play becomes very double-edged and I have not had great success with it.  The Poisoned Pawn was once almost eradicated but has made a comeback and fills 112 pages in Nunn's book.  I recently lost as White against a 2000+ player here on Gameknot in that variation.  Interestingly enough some players have played 7...Qc7 against me here which also has a whole chapter to itself in Nunn's book.  I've carried on with 8. Qf3 which Nunn describes as the critical line.

Bd3 these days.  Looking it up in Nunn I find that 9. 0-0-0 was considered the main line by Nunn in 1996 when the book was published followed by one of those other moves.  Those lines take up 84 pages of closely packed analysis so we're in well-trodden territory.

I recently successfully played such a sac in the annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=28675 though that was from a slightly different position and move order and against a weaker player than Burt.
418,18,11,1Qh3,b'r3k2r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2NB3Q/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b kq -',This is the first departure from a main line.  Nunn gives two examples: a correspondence game from 1983 and an OTB game from 1990 but it doesn't feature in the later NCO.
419,18,12,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2NB3Q/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',I continue with my plan to exploit the half-open c-file and avoid castling into White's kingside attack.  The drawback of this approach is that White is also well placed to attack Black's Queenside castled position possibly with sacrifices on b5 d5 or e6.  Black has to be very careful.  White also has to resist temptation and not get carried away with sacrificial attacks that end in failure.
420,18,13,1a3,b'2kr3r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/P1NB3Q/1PP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',This leaves Nunn's two quoted games but transposes into a third (Mateu-Quiroga Buenos Aires 1995).
421,18,14,1Kb8,b'1k1r3r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/P1NB3Q/1PP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',Now this takes us completely out of Nunn's book.  I recently lost another game (http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=26547) in this sort of position when I didn't get my K off the c-file early enough.  In this position I have the added motivations of wanting to get off the White Q's diagonal h3-c8 and to make room for my R to come to c8 creating a battery on the half-open c-file.  
422,18,15,1Bh4,b'1k1r3r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP1B/P1NB3Q/1PP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',This took me by surprise.  White adopts a cautious approach not committing anything to an irreversible attack but waiting for Black to make a mistake (a fairly sure bet from me!)
423,18,16,1Rdc8,b'1kr4r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP1B/P1NB3Q/1PP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',Black continues with his plan but how is he going to divert all White's defenders if White doesn't himself attack?

425,18,18,1Nc5,b'1kr4r/1bq1bppp/p2ppn2/1pn5/3NPP2/P1NB3Q/1PP2BPP/2KRR3 w - -',Black attacks the Bd3 and defends the Be7 not that it was attacked at this point but could soon have been.  Both players had so many options around here that every aspect of the position and every move required meticulous consideration.  This move also permits White to play e5 if he wants when Black plans to play ...Nd5 inviting White to swap and clearing the way to c2.

Alternatively White might have planned f5 when this gave me the option of taking on f5 as well as responding with ...e5

While the rooks aren't coordinated there may be an opportunity to exploit so I now spent some time looking to see if I could get my Be7 to b4 before White could complete his rook manoeuvre.  However first I found it necessary to practice a little prophylaxis on the kingside.  I didn't want White to gobble up my unprotected pawns with an easily won end-game while I engaged in speculative adventures on the queenside.

I did however have to be careful to avoid a mass swap off on d8 unless it was safe.  Given White's response perhaps it would have been better to take on a3.  White could also have swapped Qs and forced this R to move again with 25. Qb6+ Qxb6 26. Bxb6.

Will suggested afterwards that I might have grovelled for a while longer with 31.... Qa7 32. Rxa7+ Kxa7 with the hope of queening the e-pawn; but he soon found a way to prevent that.

White's goal is to fianchetto the kingside Bishop and black often uses a long castle. Because I was unfamiliar with the opening I was the first to break standard play.

Qe7 seems the only good move for black to me and with White's light squared Bishop and queenside Rook still out of the game there is a chance Black can make some headway if he is able to castle.

It continues something like this. 15. Qxe5+ Nxe5 16. Bxb4 Nxf3 17. Nxf3 and White has a large material advantage. Also possible is 15. Nxe5 Bxe2 16. Bxe2 Bxc5 17.

It is a feeling I know all too well. It is strange that once I make one bad move my first instinct is to blunder further rather than accept the loss and play strongly afterwards hoping for a mistake from my opponent. I imagine most of us have been there before.

He has to defend it with two figures - one is the queen but the other is either the knight or the rook. The black control of the center and the white pawns position does not allow the knight to get to any better square and the rook can not come to the third row in order to assist the white's attack and with the neutralization of the g4 possibility the white's King side attack came to a stop.

912,35,17,Rhb8,b'rr6/3nqpk1/4p1p1/2p1P2p/p1PpNQ1P/1P6/P4PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Instead using three pieces to guard the crucial weak black squares (f7 f6 and c5) it is done with only the knight and the queen. So it is time to see what can be done on the Queen's side.

916,35,21,3Rd2,b'8/3nqpk1/4p1p1/2p1P2p/2PpN2P/1P4Q1/r2R1PP1/6K1 b - -',It will prove that the white should have hold onto his rook. The black's advanced d-pawn is much harder to control without a rook than with a rook in play.

921,35,26,4Ng5,b'8/2Qnk3/4pqp1/2p3Np/2Pp3P/1P6/5PP1/6K1 b - -',It seems that the white underestimated the d-pawn; that's a lesson that will cost him the game.

926,35,31,Qb4,b'8/3nk3/4p1p1/2p4p/QqP4P/1P4P1/8/6K1 w - -',The white had to try as hard as he could to preserve the queen.
