1,0,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Ruy Lopez my favorite. I wish more players would let me play it...
2,0,2,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',3. ... d6?! is the Old Steinitz Defense not a popular line these days with most masters preferring to defer d6 by playing 3. ... a6 first. The move as played is acceptable and many famous champions (including Steinitz of course) played it but it gives up the center to white and more modern analysis of the Ruy Lopez has found better lines for black.
3,0,3,Ba4,b'r2qkbnr/1ppb1ppp/p1np4/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Inevitable.

7,0,7,1Nxf5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pn/p1np3p/4pN2/B7/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',This poor knight ran a long way from b1 just to die here on f5.

9,0,9,1Qd5+,b'r2q2k1/1pp4n/p2p1rpp/3Qn1b1/8/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',How's that for centralized? It even wins a pawn.
10,0,10,2Raxc1,b'r2q4/1pp3kn/p4rpp/4Q3/8/2P5/PPB2PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Thank you black for trading a strong bishop for white's weak bishop connecting white's rooks getting the trapped white rook on a1 into the game and trading material when white is ahead by a pawn. I think I'm giving 20. ... Bxc1? a question mark though truth be told black didn't have much better.
11,0,11,2Rd7+,b'r4q2/1ppR2k1/p4rpp/4Q1n1/8/2P5/PPB2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',22. ... Qf8 allows the white rook to slide on up to the 7th rank. But any other queen move would have allowed white to play 23. Qe7+ so black chose the lesser of two weavels. Really at this point black is all bottled up and ready for the cork.
12,0,12,2Qxe8,b'4Qq2/1ppR1nk1/p4rpp/8/8/1BP5/PP3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Black was pretty much done for. With his rook pinned on f6 it was no help in the defense of the knight on f7 so black was powerless to stop 25. Rxf7+ forking his king and queen. Moving his king away from g7 would break the pin on the rook but would also remove the rook's only protector allowing 25. Qxf6. But 24. ... Re8 solves those problems by creating a new one: the loss of a rook and a knight. Still black had nothing better so I'll spare the ? for the move.
13,0,13,2Ree7,b'8/1ppRRnk1/p4r1p/6p1/8/1BP5/PP3PPP/6K1 b - -',White is up a rook+pawn and about to gain a knight too.
14,0,14,2Rxf7+,b'5k2/1pp2R2/p6p/6p1/8/1BP5/PP3PPP/6K1 b - -',Somewhere there's a fat lady singing. Black's king is trapped on the 8th rank (he can escape via a2 but white is about to put an end to that bolt-hole). All black can do is wait for white's king to come finish the mating combination.
15,0,15,3f4,b'4k3/2R5/pp5p/6p1/5P2/1BP5/PP4PP/6K1 b - f3',Bold-hole closed.
16,0,16,3Kxf4,b'4k3/2R5/p7/1p5p/5K2/1BP5/PP4PP/8 b - -',Almost there.
17,0,17,3Bf7+,b'4k3/2R2B2/8/1p2K2p/p7/2P5/PP4PP/8 b - -',Here white announced mate in 4 and entered the conditional moves starting with 36. Bf7+. However in revisiting this game I discovered there was a mate in 3 I could have played instead: 36. Be6+ Kd8 37. Kd6 (any) 38. Rc8# or if black tries anything else for his 36th move 37. Kf6 (any) 38. Rc8#. Oh well 3 would have been prettier but 4 worked well enough for the win.
18,0,18,3Kf6,b'5k2/2R2B2/5K2/1p5p/p7/2P5/PP4PP/8 b - -',But black speeded things up a bit. Final position. 36. ... Kd8 37. Kd6 (any) 38. Be6 (any) 39. Rc8# was a bit longer but gets the same result.
19,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Mini-tournament I'm playing white and begin with the Open Game.

26,1,7,1Rad1,b'2rqk2r/4npbp/p2pb3/1p1Np2Q/4B3/N5P1/PPP2P1P/3R1RK1 b k -',Black defended the pawn on h7 by threatenng to win the knight on d5 if white captures the pawn. And not 17. Nxe7 Qxe7 18. Bxh7? for now the white bishop is pinned with no dangerous discoveries so black can win it at his leisure.
27,1,8,1c3,b'2rq1rk1/5pbp/p2pb3/1p1Bp2Q/8/N1P3P1/PP3P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',Defending the c-pawn and allowing white's knight to get off of that horrible a3 square.
28,1,9,1Rxd5,b'2rq1rk1/5pbp/p2p4/1p1Rp2Q/8/N1P3P1/PP3P1P/5RK1 b - -',18. ... Bxd5? might have been the biginning of the end for black. Now his backward pawn on d6 will become problematic.
29,1,10,2Nb4,b'5rk1/5pbp/p1rp4/qp1Rp2Q/1N6/2P3P1/PP3P1P/5RK1 b - -',20. ... Qa5? was definitely not a good move for black. It puts his queen on the far side of the world and effectively removes her from the rest of the game with no compensation. As a rule of thumb don't lock your queen in a closet far from the action. Queens belong out of the closet.
30,1,11,2Rfd1,b'5rk1/5pbp/pr1p4/qp1Rp2Q/1N6/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',21. ... Rb6 was forced. The rook must be saved but any other rook moves loses the backward pawn on d6.
31,1,12,2Qg5,b'3r2k1/5pbp/pr1p4/qp1Rp1Q1/1N6/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',23. Qg5! threatens too much for black to hold it all. The simple threat is 24. Qxd8+ and the less obvious threat is 24. Rxe5 and now black cannot capture the rook with his pinned bishop on g7 nor can he capture with the pawn on d6 for it is also pinned preventing 25. Rxd8#.
32,1,13,2Qg4,b'3r2k1/6bp/pr1p1p2/qp1Rp3/1N4Q1/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',23. f6 was the only move that held it together for a moment. The new threat is 25. Qe6+ winning the backward d6 pawn.
33,1,14,2Rc5,b'3r4/5kbp/pr1p1p2/qpR1p3/1N4Q1/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Now threatening 26. Rc7+ and 27. Qxg7. Black is busted. He tries for the material grab.
34,1,15,2Rd7+,b'8/3R1kbp/pr3p2/qp2p3/1p4Q1/2P3P1/PP3P1P/6K1 b - -',Black could have tried 26. ... Rb7 but the game ends in a king hunt: 27. Qh5+ Ke6 28. Qe8+ Kf5 29. Rd6 Kg4 30. h3+ Kg5 31. g4 Rf7 32. Qxf7 Kf4 33. Rxf6+ Bxf6 34. Qxf6+ Ke4 35. Qf5#. Still that continuation would have been much more lively than simply capturing the white knight for now it's white to mate in 2: 27. ... K (any) 28. Qxg7 (any) 29. Qf7#.
35,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone this match was against the highest rated player in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament in fact just before the draw offer his rating was 1851.  This was a strange game of which again I was struck down by passivitis and I found myself exchanging my opponent's horsies which were threatening to run riot in my position for both my bishops.  I was very lucky to draw this game how lucky only you the jury can tell me.  I kick off with e4 and my opponent gives me the Sicilian (c5).

I did contemplate exchanging queens here( 9.Qf6 Qxf6.10. exf6) He could of course wait until I exchanged and simply moved Rg8 so I decided against that.  I wanted more support out and my king tucked away too so I moved Nf3.

78,3,21,Nd7,b'r1b1kr2/pp1nqpQ1/2npp2B/8/2PP4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w q -',Black makes that protecting move. His King does look cramped.

87,3,30,2dxe6,b'2r2r2/pb2k3/1p1pPp2/4n3/2P4B/2PB4/P4PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',my worry here was that I was opening the h1-a8 line for his bishop and with the g and h file wide open the fox could mount  a serious attack. Still I decided to break into his wall of pawns. In the process if he went Kxe6 his knight would be pinned.
88,3,31,2Kxe6,b'2r2r2/pb6/1p1pkp2/4n3/2P4B/2PB4/P4PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',The fox makes that move.

90,3,33,2Rfh8,b'2r4r/pb6/1p1pkp2/4n3/2P2P1B/2PB4/P5PP/3RR1K1 w - -',and he in  turn attacks my bishop.
91,3,34,fxe5,b'2r4r/p7/bp1pk3/4p3/2P5/2PB2B1/P5PP/3RR1K1 w - -',Slowly but surely the kings defenses are vanishing.
92,3,35,2Re4,b'2r4r/p7/bp1pk3/4p3/2P1R3/2PB2B1/P5PP/3R2K1 b - -',c4 was in danger ! so I protected it with my rook. In preparation for doubling them on the e file.
93,3,36,2Rcg8,b'6rr/p7/bp1pk3/4p3/2P1R3/2PB2B1/P5PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black swithes his play to the open files.
94,3,37,2a4,b'6rr/p7/bp1pk3/4p3/P1P1R3/2PB2B1/6PP/3R2K1 b - a3',I wanted to advance c4 to attack d6 to take e5 protection away but first I needed b6 out of the way .
95,3,38,2Bb7,b'6rr/pb6/1p1pk3/4p3/P1P1R3/2PB2B1/6PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black attacks my rook but also a worry to me was g2. Bishop and a potetial rook attack.  
96,3,39,2Re2,b'6rr/pb6/1p1pk3/4p3/P1P5/2PB2B1/4R1PP/3R2K1 b - -',I had to withdraw and protect g2 at the same time. 
97,3,40,2Bc6,b'6rr/p7/1pbpk3/4p3/P1P5/2PB2B1/4R1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Attacking my a pawn  and tring to create a passed pawn
98,3,41,2a5,b'6rr/p7/1pbpk3/P3p3/2P5/2PB2B1/4R1PP/3R2K1 b - -',I continue with my plan.
99,3,42,2bxa5,b'6rr/p7/2bpk3/p3p3/2P5/2PB2B1/4R1PP/3R2K1 w - -',He now has a fox on the run but I can now look at his kings defenses.
100,3,43,Rxg3,b'7r/p7/2bpk3/p1P1p3/8/2PB2r1/4R1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black decides to take the presure off of e5 by sacrificing his rook . 
101,3,44,3hxg3,b'7r/p7/2bpk3/p1P1p3/8/2PB2P1/4R1P1/3R2K1 b - -',However all my pawns are now doubled now and black has took the sting out of my attack. Still 5 up.
102,3,45,3Rde1,b'7r/p7/2b1k3/p1Ppp3/8/2PB2P1/4R1P1/4R1K1 b - -',doubled my rooks at last
103,3,46,3e4,b'7r/p7/2b1k3/p1Pp4/4p3/2PB2P1/4R1P1/4R1K1 w - -',pawn storm. 
104,3,47,Ke5,b'7r/p7/2b5/p1Ppk3/4p3/2P3P1/4R1P1/1B2R1K1 w - -',Black gets ever closer
105,3,48,3Rf2,b'7r/p7/2b5/p1Ppk3/4p3/2P3P1/5RP1/1B2R1K1 b - -',I need to try to get around the back some how. I needed to be careful which rook I moved. Move Rf1 and his bishop was lurking ...Bb5 winning one of my rooks.
106,3,49,3a4,b'7r/p7/2b5/2Ppk3/p3p3/2P3P1/5RP1/1B2R1K1 w - -',There goes that fox. 
107,3,50,3g4,b'7r/p7/2b5/2Ppk3/p3p1P1/2P5/5RP1/1B2R1K1 b - -',Looking to check him on f5.
108,3,51,3Bd7,b'7r/p2b4/8/2Ppk3/p3p1P1/2P5/5RP1/1B2R1K1 w - -',Black defends f5 and attacks g4. By moving the bishop there though he does take a defender awy from d5.
109,3,52,3c4,b'7r/p2b4/8/2Ppk3/p1P1p1P1/8/5RP1/1B2R1K1 b - -',So I decide against advancing g4 and opt for c4 instead attacking d5. I know I will be a pawn down in the exchange but I want that king out from behind those pesky pawns.
110,3,53,3Bxe4+,b'7r/p7/8/2Pk4/p3B1b1/8/5RP1/4R1K1 b - -',Black king is now in the open. My dilema here was do I take e4 with my rook or bishop I went with the latter. A wrong choice I feel now. 37. Rxe4 would have been better attacking both a4 and g4. 
111,3,54,3Kxc5,b'7r/p7/8/2k5/p3B1b1/8/5RP1/4R1K1 w - -',He was 3 pawns to 2 up in that exchange. It should have been better for me.
112,3,55,3Rb1,b'7r/p7/8/2k5/p3B1b1/8/5RP1/1R4K1 b - -',still 4 up. So not too bad.  I did not want that fox been aided by his king so blocked that route off.
113,3,56,3a3,b'7r/p7/8/2k5/4B1b1/p7/5RP1/1R4K1 w - -',The fox still runs. 
114,3,57,3Ra2,b'7r/p7/8/2k5/4B1b1/p7/R5P1/1R4K1 b - -',That fox is now keeping busy 2 rooks. Not good for me.
115,3,58,3Re8,b'4r3/p7/8/2k5/4B1b1/p7/R5P1/1R4K1 w - -',Black makes his move while my rooks are stuck.
116,3,59,4Rxa3,b'4r3/p7/8/2k5/4B1b1/R7/6P1/1R4K1 b - -',A risk.  I would not have done this if I was not 4 up but my thoughts were better having 2 mobile rooks and no foxes to worry about in exchange for my bishop. Was this a right play?
117,3,60,4Rxa7,b'8/R7/8/2k5/4r1b1/8/6P1/1R4K1 b - -',My advantage is dwindling a little. 
118,3,61,4Rg7,b'8/6R1/2k5/8/4r1b1/8/6P1/1R4K1 b - -',Im thinking long and hard if I should exchange my rook for his bishop. Maybe not a good exchange.
119,3,62,4Rf1,b'8/8/6R1/4k3/4r1b1/8/6P1/5RK1 b - -',Stopping blacks king or bishop attacking my rook and keeping his king away from mine.
120,3,63,4Rgf6,b'8/8/5R2/8/3kr1b1/8/6P1/5RK1 b - -',Uniting my rooks.
121,3,64,4g3,b'8/8/5R2/4k3/4r1b1/6P1/8/5RK1 b - -',Gives my king some breathing space.
122,3,65,Re1+,b'8/8/5R2/4k3/8/6Pb/5R2/4r1K1 w - -',now i'm under attack.
123,3,66,5Kh2,b'8/8/5R2/4k3/8/6Pb/5R1K/4r3 b - -',My only move. An exchange would have meant a draw.
124,3,67,5Be6,b'8/8/4bR2/4k3/8/6P1/5R1K/4r3 w - -',Black retreats.
125,3,68,5Rf6f8,b'5R2/8/4b3/4k3/8/6P1/5R1K/4r3 b - -',My idea here is to try and pin his bishop with Re8.
126,3,69,Ra6,b'4R3/8/r3b3/4k3/8/6P1/5R1K/8 w - -',Blacksaw the attack. I was planning Re2 next and he would have lost his bishop but now he has it protected.
127,3,70,5g4,b'4R3/8/r3b3/4k3/6P1/8/5R1K/8 b - -',So I decide to advance my pawn knowing that my Rook on the f file stops the king attacking it.
128,3,71,5g5,b'4R3/8/r2kb3/6P1/8/8/5R1K/8 b - -',I have to move the pawn as he has unpinned his bishop.
129,3,72,5Ref8,b'5R2/3k4/r3b3/6P1/8/8/5R1K/8 b - -',I reunite my rooks. Boy this is tough and taking some time to work out.  Cat and mouse at the moment.
130,3,73,5Ra4,b'5R2/3k4/4b3/6P1/r7/8/5R1K/8 w - -',Black now attacks my pawn
131,3,74,5Rf8f4,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/r4R2/8/5R1K/8 b - -',I block the potential black rook move of Rg4 or Rh4+ and offer my rook up for exchange.  
132,3,75,5Ra3,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/5R2/r7/5R1K/8 w - -',Of course black does not want the exchange and trys another way through threatening Rh3+
133,3,76,5Rf2f3,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/5R2/r4R2/7K/8 b - -',I block that.
134,3,77,5Rf3f1,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/5R2/6K1/8/r4R2 b - -',Blocking the attack again.
135,3,78,5Ra3+,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/5R2/r5K1/8/5R2 w - -',Now I need to be careful!!!  Kh4 would result in disaster!  Kh4?? Rh3#!  My own pawn blocking the kings escape.
136,3,79,6Rf1f2,b'8/3k4/4b3/6P1/5R2/8/r4R1K/8 b - -',and the blocking continues.
137,3,80,6g6,b'8/3k4/4b1P1/8/5R2/r7/5R1K/8 b - -',I decide to advance my pawn ahead of blocking again.
138,3,81,6Rf4f6,b'8/3k4/4bRPr/8/8/8/5RK1/8 b - -',protecting the pawn 
139,3,82,6Kg3,b'8/3k4/5RPr/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/8 b - -',again moving King to g1 would have resulted in a lost game. 
140,3,83,6Rh1,b'8/3k4/5RP1/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/7r w - -',Black looks to put his rook on g1 attacking King and pawn.
141,3,84,6Rf6f7+,b'8/3k1R2/6P1/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/7r b - -',I thought about this one for a while. I may loose a rook but I would queen my pawn if he took it.  Plus If he did not go for it I would have my rook on the 7th rank.
142,3,85,6Ke8,b'4k3/5R2/6P1/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/7r w - -',I thought this was a poor move .  His king is now trapped on the back rank.
143,3,86,6Rh7,b'4k3/7R/6P1/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/7r b - -',If he exchanges  I Queen.  I spot a checkmate at last. Moving my f Rook to  to b2.  Will the fox see it.
144,3,87,6Rg1+,b'4k3/7R/6P1/3b4/8/6K1/5R2/6r1 w - -',No.
145,3,88,6Kh4,b'4k3/7R/6P1/3b4/7K/8/5R2/6r1 b - -',I moved in here  rather than to the middle of the board to stop being chased about.
146,3,89,6Rxg6,b'4k3/7R/6r1/3b4/7K/8/5R2/8 w - -',The pawn falls but...
147,3,90,6Rb2,b'4k3/7R/6r1/3b4/7K/8/1R6/8 b - -',The end is nigh. 
148,3,91,6Bg8,b'4k1b1/7R/6r1/8/7K/8/1R6/8 w - -',Maybe R d6 would have prolonged it.
149,3,92,7Rb8#,b'1R2k1b1/7R/6r1/8/7K/8/8/8 b - -',The end at last.  I nearly blew it a couple of times. Up to date my biggest scalp. A very nice game to play.
150,4,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not the standard opening move but it is 1 I quite often play myself so it's well within my comfort zone..

196,5,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The strongest and most direct test of the Nimzo-Larsen is 1. ... e5; however d5 is not a bad move. In fact had the opponent played e5 I would most likely have the advantage in theoretical knowledge.
197,5,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp1pppp/p1n5/3p4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',The fact that Black has not played e5 allows White to develop more aggressively with more control over the center. If e5 had been played White could still play Nf3 but with ... e4 Black could gain more space and force the Knight to find a new home. If then Nd4 White's development becomes more cramped. 
198,5,3,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/2P5/1P2PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq c3',The Nimzo-Larsen generally involves White attacking Black's center with a flank pawn.

200,5,5,Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pp1/p1nbpn1p/3pN3/2PP4/1P2P3/PB2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',In retrospect I should not have made this move as it allows Black to double my pawns on the e file without any damage on the Black position. Also my development was not complete; the Knight on b1 has yet to be developed. However...

202,5,7,dxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2pp1/p3p2p/8/2P1p3/4P3/PB2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black handled the blunder fairly well. Now I have an isolated pawn and I'm only up one point. However I still have the two bishops with one strongly placed while the Bishop on c8 is looking rather hemmed in. 
203,5,8,Qg5,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2pp1/p3p2p/6q1/2P1p3/4P3/PBQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',If Black played f5 it would serve to hem the Bishop in even more. The question is whether the loss of the pawn on e4 or the lack of freedom for his Bishop is a greater factor.
204,5,9,1Bd3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2pp1/p6p/4p1q1/2P1Q3/3BP3/PB3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',My thought was to place the Bishop more actively with initiative.

208,5,13,2a5,b'r3r1k1/1p3p2/p1p1b1pp/P3B3/2P5/3BP3/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',This move was incorrect. I should have noticed the possibility of a discovered attack on the hanging Bishop. Especially since Black's last move lined the Rook up with the Bishop.

214,5,19,2Bxf7,b'5r2/1p2rBk1/p6p/P1p5/2P3P1/4PR2/7P/5RK1 b - -',Here I decided to go ahead and exchange some material for a position with a passed pawn and potential for another. Without the support of the King Black's Queenside has no hope but when the King supports the Queenside White can force another passed pawn on the Kingside.

219,5,24,3hxg5,b'8/8/2k5/p1p1P1P1/2P1K3/8/8/8 b - -',And there you have it Ladies and Gentlemen! Mutually Supporting Pawns! It always feels very nice applying what one has learned from an endgame book (Purdy on the Endgame). I don't believe many players at my current rating know about this endgame idea. Now the White King is free to do as he pleases! The pawns on e5 and g5 are very good soldiers and are self sustaining. The King no longer needs to shepherd them.

I am playing against dmaestro in this game - do not be fooled by that low rating by his name but remember his optimum rating is 1730 so he is not to be underestimated.  He played very well right up until the end and a slip up cost him two pawns.  There was an interesting material imbalance.  Dmaestro had a rook + pawn against B + Knight.  Here is how the drama unfolds.  Firstly dmaestro kicks off with d4 and I decide to experiment with the Englund gambit with e5.
270,9,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ...... Nc6 - development.

278,9,9,cxd6,b'3r1rk1/3n1ppp/2Bpb3/p3p3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',16. ...... cxd6 - Fou Lenoir disappears from the board and so does a white horsie.  My queenside pawns are connected.

Ne7 - for the next few moves there is a lot of manoeuvering but basically it is a case of Operation Joblock this hedgehog defence can sometimes be very effective against opponents who overreach themselves and find themselves mightily spiked!
286,9,17,Rb8,b'1r3k2/4np2/4b1p1/2R5/3R1PP1/6K1/7P/8 w - -',34. ...... Rb8 - while seemingly aimlessly moving my pieces around I am keeping an eye on the square f5 - if that g pawn moves and dmaestro's king stays where he is there is a peach of a knight fork on that square.
287,9,18,Bxb3,b'3R4/4npk1/6p1/8/5PP1/1b4K1/7P/8 w - -',37. ....... Bxb3 - rook trade.
288,9,19,3h4,b'3R4/4npk1/6p1/8/5PPP/1b4K1/8/8 b - h3',38. h4 - an imposing wall of pawns but appearances can be deceptive.

I felt that trading off the two white knights would leave a strong endgame for black with his passed d-pawn and kingside pawn majority while the lone queenside pawn can bottle up whites doubled queenside pawns. However after consideration I decided that as long as the DSB is on the long diagonal threatening white's b2 pawn white's knight is trapped on a4. This seemed like a better strategic consideration than simply inviting an exchange (an invitation that might be declined anyway). Turns out the strategy dissolved in two more moves so it didn't really matter either way.
450,17,19,Kf7,b'2b5/5kpp/p3pb2/3p4/NP2p3/1P4P1/2N2P1P/6K1 w - -',Feels like an endgame. All the major pieces are gone and strategies are forming around promoting pawns. Although with 11 pawns and 4 pieces on the board it also feels a bit like a middlegame too. However I make an endgame decision that it's time for the black king to join the party. Threats against white's queenside pawns may give the black king an avenue to get in front of his passed d-pawn and bring him home to d1.

The lone isolated pawn invites white to capture it undoubling the white pawns and giving white supported passed pawns on the queenside - but it will cost white a knight (35. bxa5? Kxc5). I had to think about this one long and hard. First could white win with a pair of supported passed pawns on the queenside? After playing out lots of continuations I decided he could not. Black's king and bishop pair could dismantle those pawns quickly enough to not lose ground on the kingside or in the center. Second could white sacrifice his knight on e4 destroy black's center and then safely capture on a5 forcing black to divert time and resources to stopping the white queenside pawns while black's king rampages through black's remaining pawns?

455,17,24,Kc5,b'2b5/6pp/5b2/2k1p3/1N2p3/1P2K1P1/5P1P/8 w - -',Normally it's a bad idea when a knight has your king in check to approach the knight on a space diagonal to that knight.

But in this case both squares that allow white's knight to move with check are covered (d3 and a6) so white can only retreat the knight.

Even doubled and isolated the two black pawns in the center are working together to limit white's king's mobility. White had planned to gain the pawn on e4 with 40. Nxe4 Bxe4 41. Kxe4. This would almost force black to waste time with his king dealing with white's passed b-pawn giving white time to hassle black's kingside. End result would be three pawns each with white having a superior pawn structure and black having a bishop. That could end in a draw. However as played white's king must retreat away from the black pawns and then black wins a pawn with 40. ... Kb4 leaving black with a material advantage of bishop+pawn enough to win.

As played whichever way white captures and now he must capture black can recapture with the backward c-pawn and avoid doubling or isolating any pawns.

It's not quite a blunder since that pawn will die or with 21. ... a5 white would follow with 22. Nc4 threateing to win the backward pawn on b6 and after 22. ... Bxc4 23. Bxc4 white can then freely attack the b6 pawn with his rook from b7. One pawn seems guaranteed to fall but 21. ... a6?! seems like wasting time when there's better things to do. I think I planned to play 22. ... Ne5 after white unpins the knight but that would have been a blunder blocking the bishop on d4 from its defense of the rook on h8.
473,18,15,f5,b'3rk2r/2Rn4/Bp1Pp2p/3b1pp1/3b3P/6B1/P2N1P1R/4K3 w k f6',I realized in time that 22. ... Ne5? would lose the pawn on g5 so I look for ways to harrass the white pieces. White cannot allow his bishop to be trapped by 23. ... f4.
474,18,16,Bxh8,b'3rk2b/2Rn4/Bp1Pp3/3b1pp1/8/6B1/P2N1P2/4K3 w - -',White may have his passed pawn on d6 but black has 3-for-1 pawns on the kingside. There must be a way to exploit that.
475,18,17,Be5,b'3rk3/2Rn4/Bp1Pp3/3bbp2/5B2/8/P2N4/4K3 w - -',It seemed clever at the time. I didn't anticipate white's reply though in hindsight it seems obvious. I just figured he wouldn't let black take the d6 pawn so he would have to trade bishops.
476,18,18,Bxd6,b'3rk3/2Rn4/Bp1bp3/3b1pB1/8/8/P2N4/4K3 w - -',Well gotta get the pawn anyway.
477,18,19,Bb8,b'1b1rk3/R2n4/Bp2p3/3b1pB1/8/8/P2N4/4K3 w - -',28. Ra7 surprised me. Why not just 28. Rxd8 and win the exchange? Material would be imbalanced but pretty much even. Black ahead by two pawns for the exchange would be relying on trying to promote those two passed kingside pawns. But white tried something else and black found a way to save his rook.
478,18,20,Rxd7,b'1b2k3/3r4/Bp2p3/3b1pB1/8/8/P2N4/4K3 w - -',White gives up the exchange voluntarily but he seems to have a plan.
479,18,21,Bxa2,b'1b2k3/3r4/1p2p3/1B3pB1/8/8/b2N4/4K3 w - -',OK he can win the exchange back so I'll just liberate him of his last remaining pawn.
480,18,22,e5,b'1b2k3/3r4/1p6/1B2ppB1/8/5N2/b7/4K3 w - -',I think white's plan here was to try to get his knight to attack the pinned black rook. But it has no path to get there that isn't covered by black's bishops or pawns. The route via h5 to f6 will still take a full 5 moves to achieve during which time black's DSB will find a way to e7 and shut white down.
481,18,23,Kf7,b'1b6/3r1k2/1p3B2/1B2pp2/8/5N2/b7/4K3 w - -',32. Bf6!? was not quite a blunder but I believe it backfired on white. I think his plan was to win the pawn at e4 or force it forward to e5 where white could then play Be5 with possibly dire consequences for the black rook. However black's simple reply forces white's hand. He must now take the black rook or lose the chance entirely.
482,18,24,Kxf6,b'1b6/3B4/1p3k2/4pp2/8/5N2/b7/4K3 w - -',Black's king defends both pawns. Black is ahead by three pawns and has the bishop pair to guide them to promotion. White correctly resigns.

The important factor is that black is attacking a defended knight on e5 with even material (knight for knight) while white is attacking an under-defended knight on e4 threatenting to win a pawn. Black's knight cannot retreat from e4 or black will lose his queen: 6. ... Nf6?? 7. Nc6+.

The crucial success of the attack against e6 is that it begins after exd6 by threatening black's queen. No counter action by black is likely to succeed unless it puts equal pressure on white's queen or threatens checkmate.
492,19,9,2dxe6,b'2kr3r/pppq4/4Pb2/5p2/2P2p1p/4B3/PP1N1QPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black initiated a counter attack that must lose material because his queen is now en prise.

One threat now is 22. ... Bg5 which would win the white bishop on e3 and moving the bishop means losing the knight on d2 so white defends the bishop.

495,19,12,2Bxg5,b'2kr4/ppp5/4P3/5pB1/2P4p/3q4/PP1N2PP/4RRK1 b - -',Capturing the black rook and attacking the remaining rook forces black to spend a tempo retreating the rook. 24. ... Rg8 threatens the undefended white bishop on g5 but allows white to play 25. e7! and black cannot capture the bishop for it costs him his queen: 25. ... Bxg5?? 26. e8=Q+ Qd8 27. Qxd8 Kxd8 leaving white two rooks and a knight against black's rook.

497,19,14,2Nb3,b'2k1r3/pp2P3/2p5/5pB1/2P4p/1N1q4/PP4PP/4RRK1 b - -',26. Nb3! is the winning move. Any knight move opens the d-file for a white rook but only 26. Nb3! covers both d4 and c5 to keep black from stalling with checks. Any other knight move would allow black to play 26. ... Qxc4 27. ... Qc5+ and 28. ... Rxe7 which would have invalidate the noble white queen's sacrifice. However as played Black has no queen moves that offer check without losing the queen. Regardless of black's next move white will play 27. Rd1 followed soon by Rd8+ forcing black to play Rxd8 and then exd8=Q+ and the new queen is defended by the white bishop and this is checkmate if black doesn't move the b7 pawn or put his queen somewhere to capture the newly promoted pawn (leaving white an unopposed rook+knight endgame). Black resigned.

10. Kb1 is a useful waiting move which prevents ...Qa5 due to the following trick played in the game. I thought White can take the time to play this due to black's slow move ...a6 and was planning on choosing between h4 and g4 next move."

I was afraid black could draw this position by:

(b) moving king to d8 or c7 (close enough to defend d6 and b6 pawns and trying to stop a passed pawn in case of a ...b6; a4 a5; b4 axb4 cxb4 sequence (assuming the c3 pawn has to be well protected by white first- this means white's king and rook are passive)

734,31,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Hi everyone - it's the same old story Joanne manages to resist Freddy for about 30 moves or so then she makes a slip up Freddy takes full advantage and duly converts his win.  This time I resigned because I knew that Freddy would be able to stop my h pawn from crowning and he had plenty of queenside passers to promote so I decided to call it a day.  Anyhow back to the beginning.  Freddy kicks off with 1. Nc3 his favourite Dunst Opening and this time I choose e5 and hope to transpose it into a kind of 4 knights opening.  Freddy turns it into a kind of Centre Game.
735,31,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3Q4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',3. ....... Nf6 - development.

Freddy seemed to think that the text move was the best of all the evils if that is the best then where on earth did I go wrong earlier?
749,31,15,3Nxe6,b'5rk1/1pp3bp/p2pN3/4n2R/4P3/2N1B3/PPP5/1K6 b - -',32. Nxe6 - Freddy nets piece for pawn.  I try some counterplay but Freddy foils it.

751,31,17,3Nf3,b'6k1/1pp3bp/p2pN3/7R/4P3/2N2n2/PPP5/1KB2r2 w - -',33. ....... Nf3 - here I am up to something very very dastardly with my knight move something as dastardly as Nd2+ Ka1 Rxc1+ Nb1 and then Rxb1#!  For one happy moment I felt as though I have got him but of course Joanne Stevens seems predestined never to put Freddy in checkmate (I'd hold a flaming street party if I did!) always the other way round worse luck!
752,31,18,Bh6,b'6k1/1pp4p/p2pN2b/3R4/4P3/2N2n2/PPP5/1KB2r2 w - -',34. ...... Bh6 - piling on the pressure but ......

754,31,20,c6,b'6k1/1p5p/p1ppN3/8/4P3/5n2/PPP5/2KN4 w - -',37. ....... c6 - after the exchanges which leave me a piece for pawn down my c pawn sidesteps the horsie's attack but he finds another target the pawn on b7.
755,31,21,h5,b'6k1/8/p1Np4/1p4np/4P3/8/PPP2N2/2K5 w - h6',40. h5 - I run with the h pawn but to no avail.
756,31,22,a5,b'8/6k1/3p4/pp4n1/1N2P2p/4K3/PPP2N2/8 w - -',43. ....... a5 - my pawns try to evade the marauding horse but again to no avail.
757,31,23,h2,b'8/6k1/3p4/6n1/pP1NP3/4K3/1PP2N1p/8 w - -',47.  ...... h2 and resigns - after taking my pawn as near to the queening square as possible I decide enough is enough I am a piece for pawn down and will be piece for 2 pawns down when Freddy plays Nf5+ next turn picking up the d6 pawn.  Look at those white passers waiting to crown take your pick Freddy.  So ends Game No 20. and I pause to reflect on the grim stats.  Master Freddy 20 - Joanne Stevens NIL!
758,32,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Mini-tournament game I decide to go Modern.
759,32,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White grabs the strong center and black plays the logical continuation of his first move.

The knight can be driven away by 13. h3 but then it simply captures with 13. ... Nxe3 and without the DSB white has no attack on the black pawn at h6.
764,32,6,b5,b'r1b2rk1/p1qnppb1/2pp2pp/1p6/3PPBn1/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R3R1K1 w - b6',Probably not my brightest move. I think a day or two had elapsed and I had lost track of white's threats. In any case black is now about to lose a pawn.

Bxf3 saddling himself with doubled isolated pawns on the g-file when 33. gxf3 solved that problem nicely. White is inviting black to exchange bishops with 33. ... Bxf3 but that would only solve white's pawn problems so black defends b7 instead.

784,32,26,Kf8,b'5k2/5p2/8/6R1/2p3P1/2P2P2/Pn1rr3/1R5K w - -',One wonders if white sees that black has a simple win in one move.

Look at those three black pieces working together like a well-oiled machine. White can survive for the short term with 42. Re5 Rxe5 43. Rxd1 Rxd1+ and now the white king escapes but faced with a lone king against two black rooks white would have a hopeless endgame and will soon be checkmated. All other continuations lead to checkmate with black playing Re1# or Rxd1# though white can stall for a while with a series of rook moves.

903,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A Mini-tournament game I'm playing white and open with the Open Game.

905,38,2,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The e5 pawn is safe but not for long so white defends it against future attacks.

908,38,5,1Qe2,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p2n1p/2b5/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',9. ... 0-0-0 put the black rook on d8 pinning the d3 pawn to the white queen which effectively left the e4 pawn unprotected. This move unpins the defending pawn.
909,38,6,1d4,b'2kr4/ppprqpp1/2p2n1p/2b5/3PP1b1/2P2N2/PP1NQPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',d3 was getting a little hot so d4 defended by a pawn seems safer. This was the reason behind 11. Nbd2 defending e4 so the d-pawn would be free to advance.
910,38,7,1g4,b'2kr4/1pprqpp1/pbp2n1p/7b/P2PP1P1/2P2N1P/1P1NQP2/R1B2RK1 b - g3',Driving off the unwanted black LSB.

Nxg4? probably deserves a question mark since black didn't have anything terribly threatening to follow it up with. The white knight on f3 shuts black's queen out of h4 and g5 and Bxf3 won't work because white would reply Nxf3 and the other knight now at f3 would still shut out the black queen. With another piece or two ready to pounce this kind of sacrifice in front of white's king can be very effective. The first sacrifice is a dubious one at best.
912,38,9,1Nc4,b'2kr4/1pprqpp1/pbp4p/8/P1NPP1b1/2P2N2/1P2QP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',White is ahead a piece for a pawn time to consider liquidating material.
913,38,10,1cxd4,b'2kr4/1pprqpp1/p1p4p/8/P1NPP1b1/5N2/1P2QP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',More sacrificing from black but this time it's very dangerous. If white handles the next couple of moves badly black will obtain a winning advantage.
914,38,11,1Nxd4,b'2kr4/1pp1qpp1/p1p4p/8/P1NNP1b1/8/1P2QP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',White's turn to sacrifice recapturing with the pinned knight. The third sacrifice is pretty much forced. If white had tried to hold everything for example with 19. Ncd2 which rescues the knight from c4 defends the pawn at e4 and defends the knight at f3 black's follow up 19. ... Qf6 puts winning pressure on the white knight at f3. It cannot move because it is pinned. If the knight at d2 moves the knight at f3 falls. At this point black would be threatening 20. ... Rxd2 21. Bxd2 Bxf3 and now with the threat of mate white might very well be forced to sacrifice the queen with 22. Qxf3 Qxf3 and black will go on to win with a crushing material superiority. Since white can't find a way to hold it all together relieving the pressure by giving back some of his material edge seemed called for.
915,38,12,2Nxe2,b'2kr4/1pp1qpp1/p1p4p/8/P1N1P3/8/1P2NP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',OK the theory now is that black can't checkmate white's exposed king with only a queen and a rook not with all the white pieces around. I hope.
916,38,13,2Ne3,b'2kr4/1pp2pp1/p1p4p/8/P3q3/4N3/1P2NP2/R1B2RK1 b - -',Consolidating and defending the king.

921,38,18,2Re1,b'1k6/1ppr1pp1/p1p4p/5N2/P5q1/R5N1/1P3PK1/2B1R3 b - -',A rook on the 8th would be very dangerous and a rook on the 7th would force an exchange of material. Both good.
922,38,19,2Re8+,b'1k2R3/1ppr1pp1/p1p3qp/5N2/P7/R5N1/1P3PK1/2B5 b - -',26. Qg6? was a mistake. It lets white win the exchange.
923,38,20,2Ne7,b'4R3/kpprNpp1/p1p3qp/8/P7/R5N1/1P3PK1/2B5 b - -',Now black's queen must move or black's rook can exchange for the knight. Either way that knight is getting the black rook.
924,38,21,2Rc3,b'4R3/kpprNpp1/p1p4p/8/P7/2R3N1/1Pq2PK1/2B5 b - -',Now simply play 29. Nf8+ K-any 30. Nb6+ (or ++) Ka7 31. Nxd7 Qxc1 and white wins the exchange. But instead white wanted to save the bishop on c1. Black's queen can go anywhere she likes and white will still get that black rook. If black defends the rook white will only win the exchange but will have kept the potentially strong bishop.
925,38,22,3Nc8+,b'2N1R3/kppr1pp1/p1p4p/8/q7/2R3N1/1P3PK1/2B5 b - -',Oops. Black went for the undefended pawn. 29. Qxa4?? is a serious blunder because now white plays the same combination but wins black's queen instead of the rook. 30. ... K-any 31. Nb6+ Ka7 32. Nxa4 leaves white ahead with two rooks+two knights+bishop vs. black's rook+5 pawns. All those pieces can easily stop black's pawns so black resigns.
