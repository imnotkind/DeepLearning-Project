0,0,0,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',4....Qf6?!  i don't think its good idea because of moving the queen so early in the game is violation of the game principles and cause a big problems   the queen blocks the black knight on g8 and force it to move to passive position  allowing Nf6 by moving out the queen its waist of tempo  4....Qf6 is not developing move  it  actually interrupts it own Pisces . most popullar move in this position is 4....Nf6 
1,0,1,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',controlling central d5 square . by the time developing the BWS to acctive and strong position .
2,0,2,Be6,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2ppbq2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -', i think 6....b5 was mach stronger   now white stays with ''2 bishops'' advantange .
3,0,3,f4,b'r3kbnr/pp1n2pp/2pppq2/8/2B1PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq f3',9.f4? olmost completlely white losing his advantange. 9.Qh5+g6.10.Qf3....white keeps his advantange .anyway the move 9.f4? opens agood game for black  9...d5!10. e5- Bc5+.11.Kh1-Qh4 -+
4,0,4,Qh4,b'r3kbnr/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/3pP3/2B2P1q/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',as i said 10...Bc5+  with tempo and than 11.....Qh4 with minimum equal game for black .
5,0,5,1g3,b'r3kbnr/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/3pP3/2B2P1q/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',11.g3!  it seems the white make its own weakness but after Be2-f3-g2- white cover it fine .
6,0,6,1Be3,b'r3kb1r/pp1n2pp/2p1p2n/3pP3/5P2/2N1B1Pq/PPP1B2P/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',steel black can play 13...Bc5  but after 14.Bxc5-Nxc5.15.Qd4 white get reed of his weak DSB. 
7,0,7,1Bg4,b'r3k2r/pp5p/2p1p1p1/2npPn2/5PB1/2N3Pq/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',another pawn on white square  and force the black queen retreet from it strong position . black cant fork the queen and the rooke because black will lose his knight  here white have a small advantange becuase of his strong bishop .
8,0,8,1b4,b'r3k2r/pp5p/2p1p1pq/2npPn2/1P3PB1/2N3P1/P1P4P/R2Q1RK1 b kq b3',the idea is that white wishes to dump the black knight away from the center and take space on the queen side but after 18.b4-Nd7.19.Qd3 the position is steel uncleared .
9,0,9,1Ne3,b'r3k2r/pp5p/2p1p1pq/2npP3/1P3PB1/2N1n1P1/P1P4P/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',mistake  black exchange to Pisces for whites rook and one pawn give white totally domination on the board taking advantage of the far away black Pisces which unemployed .
10,0,10,2bxc5,b'r3k2r/pp5p/2p1p1pq/2PpP3/5PB1/2N3P1/P1P1Q2P/R4nK1 b kq -',not 21.Rxf1-Nd7  the black knight is traped anyway .
11,0,11,2hxg3,b'r3k2r/pp5p/2p1p1pq/2PpP3/5PB1/2N3P1/P1P1Q3/R5K1 b kq -',only 21...Ke7 but still black much worse .
12,0,12,2Re1,b'r4r1k/pp5p/2p1B1pq/2PpP3/5P2/2N3P1/P1P1Q3/4R1K1 b - -',centralisation 
13,0,13,2Ne2,b'5r1k/pp2r2p/2p1B2q/2PpPPp1/8/4Q1P1/P1P1N3/4R1K1 b - -',the idea is to move 27.Nd4! which blockade d5 pawn and defends the bishop on e6 its the best position for white now  because knights in position like those are strong as rook ( see ''my system'' by Aron Nimzovich) it explains the importance of blockades .
14,0,14,2Kg2,b'5r1k/p1r4p/2p1B2q/1pPpPPp1/3N4/4Q1P1/P1P3K1/4R3 b - -',threatinig Rh1 on the next move .
15,0,15,3Bf5,b'5r1k/p1r4p/2p2Pq1/1pPpPB2/3N2p1/4Q1P1/P1P3K1/7R b - -',its a lost game for black now .
16,0,16,3e6,b'6rk/p1r2q1p/2p1PP1Q/1pPp1B2/3N2p1/6P1/P1P3K1/7R b - -',any retreet of the black queen causes  mate  34...Qf8.35.Qxh7+-Rxh7.36.Rxh7#  black was  crushed  in this game and now black trys to earning time but no use .
17,0,17,3exf7,b'7k/p1r2P1p/2p2PrQ/1pPp1B2/3N2p1/6P1/P1P3K1/7R b - -',and black resigns . because of the ''mate net'' there is no way out now   hope you enjoyed the game  thank you

The Tromp' has never impressed me as anything but a piece of brassy bragadoccio with lots of smoke and little fire.

261,8,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I am not used to this opening.  I am only accustomed to 1.d4 (when it involves the Queen's Gambit) or 1.e4.
262,8,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Therefore I decide to play this move.  Note: I am thinking about the Sicilian Defense but in reverse.  This defense starts with 1.e4 c5.
263,8,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am not used to this variation.  It appears that he is attempting a gambit but it is not the Morra Gambit.  The Morra Gambit only involves the Sicilian Defense unless gambits also transpose.  I am saying this because I know that openings transpose but I do not know if this happens with gambits.
264,8,3,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I decide to accept this gambit but it is not a true gambit.  Why?  After this move he will win the pawn back after 3.Qxd4.
265,8,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2PQ4/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',If you bring your Queen out early I will shoe it away.  At one point I was obsessed with attacking pieces and this game took place before my game against kabika.
266,8,5,Qe3+,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2P5/4Q3/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! He decides to place me in check but this is a mere nuisance.  I can easily get out of this with my Knight Queen or DSB.
267,8,6,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/8/2P5/4QN2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',He probably moved his knight for development.
268,8,7,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnp1p/2n3p1/8/2P5/4QN2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',In this position I am trying to Fianchetto my DSB.  I cannot develop with 6...Bh6.  Note: If 6...Bh6 7.Qxh6 (loosing my bishop).
269,8,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnp1p/2n3p1/8/2P5/2N1QN2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',!? He wants to continue his development.  However this move is dangerous because it crams his DSB.  If he decides to play Bd2 he won't have any more options with his bishop due to his c3 knight.  Therefore 6.Bd2 was better.
270,8,9,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnp1p/6p1/8/1nP5/2N1QN2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',!! In the meantime I decide to take advantage with this choice.  At this point he has to be careful or I will play a 3 way fork against him.  What pieces will I fork?  That will be explained momentarily.
271,8,10,h4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnp1p/6p1/8/1nP4P/2N1QN2/PP2PPP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq h3',?? This turns out to be a very serious mistake.  Now I will play a 3 way fork between his Rook Queen and King.  What is the consequence of this fork?  I am now going to win his queen for my knight.  BTW this is the fourth or fifth time that I have been able to play a 3 way fork against an opponent.  In addition I will take away his chance to castle and expose his king.  By now you would think that the game is lost for white but this is not the case.  That will be explained later in the game as it will result in a huge turning point.
272,8,11,Nf5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/6p1/5n2/2P4P/2N1PN2/PP2P1P1/R1BK1B1R w kq -',At this point I was not thinking because I am trying to win his e3 pawn.  However I did not see his DSB so taking it would loose a piece for his pawn.  At this point I am beginning to get distracted and it will go downhill throughout the rest of this game.  
273,8,12,1Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/6p1/5nN1/2P4P/2N1P3/PP2P1P1/R1BK1B1R b kq -',? I do not know why he played this move.

276,8,15,1a3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b3N1/2P4P/P1N1P1n1/1P2P1P1/R1BK1BR1 b kq -',I do not what he is trying to accomplish.  However I am going to exchange his LSB for my knight after 12...Nxf1 13.Rxf1.  Note: I am still ahead so I do not mind even exchanges.
277,8,16,b6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1p1p/1p4p1/2b3N1/2P4P/P1N1P3/1P2P1P1/R1BK1R2 w kq -',? At this point I am very distracted.  In this position the goal is to develop my LSB but this is bad timing.  Instead I should have played 13...f6 to protect my f7 pawn.  Now he is going to win a free pawn and fork my queen and rook after 14.Nxf7.  Therefore he will win my rook after he takes my pawn as I will be forced to protect my queen.
278,8,17,Bxe3,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppq2p/1p4p1/8/2P4P/P1N1b3/1P2P1P1/R1BK1R2 w q -',? I respond by taking his pawn.  This is a mistake that I will soon regret.  This is btw the disadvantage of having doubled pawns according to Jack Stockel.  However cdeburca told me that there is more to chess then doubled pawns.  That will be proven throughout the game.  At this point I am more distracted now then I was earlier.  15...d6 was best and that will be explained shortly. 
279,8,18,1Nd5,b'r1b1k2N/p1ppq2p/1p4p1/3N4/2P4P/P3b3/1P2P1P1/R1BK1R2 b q -',That is because he decides to fork my DSB so he will win my bishop as I will be forced to protect my queen.
280,8,19,Qg3,b'r1b1k2N/p1pp3p/1p4p1/3N4/2P4P/P3B1q1/1P2P1P1/R2K1R2 w q -',?? At this point I am trying to win his f1 rook so I decide to start by attacking his g2 pawn.  However this is my loosing blunder.  I will explain the reason momentarily.  In the meantime I am now as distracted as you can get.

BTW I am caught off guard by his mating plan.  How is he planning to mate me and what is my only move to prevent mate?  That will be answered shortly.

When you are distracted it is a good idea to take a break until the distraction goes away.  Sometimes it can take hours to get rid of the distraction.  However getting distracted is another way to loose a chess game.  That was illustrated in this game and it is also the moral of this story.
284,9,0,Nf1,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/5b2/1bPPp3/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R1BQKN1R b KQkq -',A little unorthodox ... The N is heading to g3 naturally.

My personal experience with Q-side castling by Black in the English is that White almost always wins simply by pushing a direct attack right down the throat of Black's Q-side be it by pawnstorm or heavy pieces down a half-open file.
286,9,2,1bxc3,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2np1nb1/8/2PPp3/P1P1P1N1/4BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Now White has his half-open file.

291,9,7,Bf7,b'2k4r/1pp1nbp1/p2p4/P2P1pr1/2PNp3/2P1P2P/3B1PPK/R4R2 w - -',Well his Bishop's finally out of the way but now his own Rook spoils the activation of Black's K-side pawns.
292,9,8,3Ne2,b'3k4/1pp1nbp1/p2p2r1/P2P1p1r/2P1p3/2P1P1PP/1R1BNP1K/1R6 b - -',Taking just a moment to attend to the defense of g3 and h3 for whichever need arises.

298,10,3,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/pBp2ppp/1pn1p3/3n2q1/3P4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Forking the knight and rook which gives white the exchange. Notice black's light squared weakness.

300,10,5,1Nxd5,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/3n2q1/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Now a very technical part of the game has arisen. The position is equal and stable except for a material advantage of white. White first starts with the mobilization of his rooks. 
301,10,6,1a3,b'2rq2k1/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P3PQ2/1P3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Blocking the b4 square for black's strong knight.

303,10,8,Rf8,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/1q1n4/2RP4/P3P3/1P2QPPP/5RK1 w - -',This simply wastes a tempo for black. Note that the c4 rook is pinned by the black queen. 
304,10,9,2e4,b'5rk1/2p2ppp/1p2p3/pq1n4/2RPP3/P7/1P2QPPP/2R3K1 b - -',Finally removing the knight from its strong post.

308,10,13,2Nh4,b'2R2rk1/5ppp/1p2p3/p6q/3PP2n/P7/1P1Q1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Black obviously is attempting counter-play - the only chance in such a position. 
309,10,14,2f3,b'5k2/5ppp/1p2p3/p6q/3PP2n/P4P2/1P1Q2PP/2R3K1 b - -',This is a strong move by white - it supports e4 protects g2 and takes the g4 square away from black's queen.

314,10,19,Kh6,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p3Q1pq/3PP2n/P4P2/1P4PP/2R3K1 w - -',Black is fully blockaded but white needs to add the rook to the battle. And this can only be accomplished by opening lines.
315,10,20,Nxf3+,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p2PQ1pq/4P3/P4n2/1P4PP/2R3K1 w - -',A desperate sacrifice but an excellent move by my opponent. The f3 pawn now becomes the target of the sacrifice and white's king-side becomes exposed. White is forced to take.
316,10,21,Qxf3,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p2PQ1p1/4P3/P4q2/1P5P/2R3K1 w - -',Threatening Qe3+. The best move is probably a movement of the rook but I blunder and simply defend e3 leaving me with the probability of endless check.
317,10,22,Qg4+,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p2P2p1/3QP1q1/P7/1P5P/2R3K1 w - -',The checks begin. 
318,10,23,Qg4+,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p2P2p1/3QP1q1/P7/1P5P/2R3K1 w - -',By now I realize that Kh1 leads to a certain draw so my only way to keep fighting for a win is to give up the hard-fought rook. 
319,10,24,Qxc1,b'8/5p1p/1p2p2k/p2P2p1/3QP3/P7/1P4KP/2q5 w - -',But now white gains multiple attacking chances and the initiative with that. Chances are roughly equal. 
320,10,25,3Qxf7+,b'8/5Q1p/1p2p3/p2P2pk/4P3/P7/1P4KP/2q5 b - -',The material is back to 0.
321,10,26,3Qxe6+,b'8/7p/1p2Q2k/p2P2p1/4P3/P7/1P4KP/2q5 b - -',White gains a pawn and gets passed connected central pawns. Now chances benefit white once again. 
322,10,27,4Qf3+,b'8/7p/1p6/p2P2pk/4P3/P4Q2/1P4KP/2q5 b - -',Preventing three-fold repetitions and preparing for the march of pawns forward. White's queen also timely defends from the black queen's threats. 
323,10,28,4e5,b'8/8/1p4k1/p2PP1pp/8/P7/1P2Q1KP/2q5 b - -',Charge!
324,10,29,Kf7,b'2q5/4Pk2/1p6/p2P2p1/7p/P7/1P2Q1KP/8 w - -',The pawns were barely stopped by black. However I realize that by giving up the e pawn I can win the pawn endgame. The rest of the game does not need much annotation. 
325,10,30,5h4,b'8/8/1p6/p5K1/7P/Pk6/1P6/8 b - h3',The pawn charges into queens. 
326,10,31,5Qa1+,b'8/8/8/p5K1/8/kp6/8/Q7 b - -',Timely stopping black's pawns while moving the king closer.
327,10,32,6Qd4+,b'8/8/8/8/1k1Q4/pp2K3/8/8 b - -',Now black is lost. 
328,10,33,6Qc4+,b'8/8/8/8/k1Q5/pp2K3/8/8 b - -',Black resigns 1-0. An excellent game showing that to win games possible draws can be avoided in favor of a risky dynamic situation which gives chances to both sides. 
329,11,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Hi all! This is the second game in this team match (the first can be found here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kings-gambit-i-accept?gm=45099 ). I open with the English and after a lot of quiet posturing early on some convoluted action starts happening in the center eventually culminating in a frenzy of activity ranging all across the board. I come out of it ahead in material but my opponent has surprising resources left to him and my pieces are scattered all over.
330,11,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the Anglo-Indian: Black intends to fianchetto his King's Bishop and attack the White center from the flanks. Of course as yet White doesn't have a center to attack.
331,11,2,b3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/1P4P1/P2PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White proclaims his intention to compete with the Black Bishop for the a1-h8 diagonal.
332,11,3,Bg2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P5/1P4P1/PB1PPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',No one has set foot in the center yet but the squares are already hotly contested. White's King's Bishop has a strong diagonal supported by the pawn at c4 but he's going to need to move his Knights sometime.
333,11,4,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2P5/1P4P1/PB1PPPBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq e6',Black makes the first claim to own a center square snubbing White's DSB's reach somewhat and giving Black some space on the kingside.
334,11,5,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1P1PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White puts some more holes in his pawns--as long as he doesn't lose his LSB they'll be okay. The point is that he can now develop his King's Knight without blocking the Bishop's reach.
335,11,6,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1P1PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black's QB can't move out yet as it must guard b7 and ...Nc6 would allow White to exchange on that square inflicting doubled pawns on Black's formation (though again White must not give up his KB lightly with all the holes on his kingside light squares.
336,11,7,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PP4/1PN1P1P1/PB2NPBP/R2QK2R b KQ d3',Both players are continuing their development logically. Black's position is a little more reserved than White's but by no means is it significantly inferior. With this move White places a piece of his own in the center of the board and challenges Black to do something about it.
337,11,8,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PP4/1PN1P1P1/PB2NPBP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Significantly increasing the threat posed by opening the board while the WK is still on his home square.
338,11,9,Ne5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/2pp1np1/4n3/2PN4/1PN1P1P1/PBQ2PBP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now each player has a Knight on a good center square. Black still has a little development to complete but after some preparation again e3-e4 and driving the White Knight away with ...c5 he may be able to bring his Bishop out with tempo to f5.
339,11,10,c5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2PN4/1PN1P1P1/PBQ2PBP/R4RK1 w - -',Kicking the Knight but this does make the d-pawn backwards and therefore weak.
340,11,11,1Nde2,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P5/1PN1P1P1/PBQ1NPBP/R4RK1 b - -',13.Nf3 would also be okay but it invites 13...Bg4 developing Black's QB and forcing the Knight to move again.
341,11,12,1Rb8,b'1rbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P5/1PN1P1P1/PBQ1NPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Getting off the long diagonal and preparing ...b5.
342,11,13,1Rad1,b'1rbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P5/1PN1P1P1/PBQ1NPBP/3R1RK1 b - -',Black's d-pawn is backward so White begins to direct his fire at it.
343,11,14,1Bg4,b'1r1qr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P3b1/1PN1P1P1/PBQ1NPBP/3R1RK1 w - -',Pinning the Knight but this Bishop has no future this far across the board.
344,11,15,1f3,b'1r1qr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P3b1/1PN1PPP1/PBQ1N1BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Played with the intention of supporting e3-e4 but as self-adjoint pointed out 15.h3 might have been better allowing the Bishop to maintain a line through the center.
345,11,16,1Bc8,b'1rbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P5/1PN1PPP1/PBQ1N1BP/3R1RK1 w - -',? This seems awfully underwhelming for the Bishop's second move--surely 15...Be6 would have been better.
346,11,17,1Nf4,b'1rbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1n3/2P2N2/1PN1PPP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 b - -',White brings up his Knight aiming to entrench a Knight in the hole at d5 and blockade Black's backward pawn.
347,11,18,1Bf5,b'1r1qr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1nb2/2P2N2/1PN1PPP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 w - -',? The Bishop moves a third time along the same diagonal with a paltry threat easily parried with yet another gain of tempo.
348,11,19,Be6,b'1r1qr1k1/pp3pbp/3pbnp1/2p1n3/2P1PN2/1PN2PP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 w - -',This Bishop has now spent four moves to arrive at a square it only needed one move to reach.
349,11,20,Nfd7,b'1r1qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3pb1p1/1Np1n3/2P1PN2/1P3PP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black wants to open a diagonal for his DSB and he doesn't actually have any way to defend d6 anyway so this move prevents White from playing Rxd6 with tempo against the BQ.
350,11,21,1Nxd6,b'1r1qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3Nb1p1/2p1n3/2P1PN2/1P3PP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Instead tempo is gained harassing the Rook. This move marks the beginning of the bloodiest phase of the game--pieces of both colors waiting on the flanks fly to the center to kill and be killed.
351,11,22,2Nd5,b'1r1q2k1/pp1nrpbp/3Nb1p1/2pNn3/2P1P3/1P3PP1/PBQ3BP/3R1RK1 b - -',This is a very strong square for a Knight; however it isn't meant to last. This move forces Black to trade off his Bishop but more importantly for White it allows a free Rook lift to the fifth rank.
352,11,23,Qc7,b'1r4k1/ppqnrpbp/3N2p1/2pRn3/2P1P3/1P3PP1/PBQ3BP/5RK1 w - -',The d-file is becoming a dangerous place to be. Black also has the problem of dealing with the threats to his Ne5 and pawn at c5. This answers both for the moment.
353,11,24,2Bh3,b'1r4k1/ppqnrpbp/3N2p1/2pRn3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/PBQ4P/5RK1 b - -',White's King's Bishop is no longer useful on the long diagonal so it moves to become dangerous again.
354,11,25,2Nf6,b'1r4k1/ppq1rpbp/3N1np1/2pRn3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/PBQ4P/5RK1 w - -',? Black denies his Ne5 two crucial defenders thinking it safe while the WR is responsible for the defense of White's Nd6 but he overlooks this intermezzo:
355,11,26,2Nb5,b'1r4k1/ppq1rpbp/5np1/1NpRn3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/PBQ4P/5RK1 b - -',! The White Knight is out of harm's way and the BQ cannot stay to defend her own loyal Knight.
356,11,27,2Qa5,b'1r4k1/pp2rpbp/5np1/qNpRn3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/PBQ4P/5RK1 w - -',Thinking to play ...Qxa2 and pin the DSB but there's no time to actually get it done.
357,11,28,Ng4,b'1r4k1/pp3pbp/6p1/qNp1B3/2P1P1n1/1P3PPB/P1Q4P/5RK1 w - -',??! Black throws several pieces to the wolves at once striving for counterplay with the threat to White's Bishop and the fork at e3 but it is not enough.
358,11,29,2Bxb8,b'1B4k1/pp3pbp/6p1/qNp5/2P1P1n1/1P3PPB/P1Q4P/5RK1 b - -',White is having none of Black's shenanigans; now the back rank is cleared out though White is about to lose his other Rook as well to this marauding Knight.
359,11,30,2Qe2,b'1B4k1/pp3pbp/6p1/qNp5/2P1P3/1P2nPPB/P3Q2P/5RK1 b - -',Keeping control of d2 and a2.
360,11,31,a6,b'1B4k1/1p3pbp/p5p1/qNp5/2P1P3/1P3PPB/P3Q2P/5K2 w - -',Black kicks the Knight to try to get his Queen back into play.
361,11,32,2Bc7,b'6k1/1pB2pbp/p5p1/qNp5/2P1P3/1P3PPB/P3Q2P/5K2 b - -',But White is going to ensure that she's as trapped as possible before he leaves.
362,11,33,Qc3,b'6k1/2B2pbp/pp1N2p1/2p5/2P1P3/1Pq2PPB/P3Q2P/5K2 w - -',White is now in a curious situation. He is vastly ahead in material but his King and Queen are relatively trapped behind a wall of pawns with the BQ glaring angrily at them. Slipping the WQ out should ensure a speedy mate on the Black King but only if White can avoid the BQ's nasty checks.
363,11,34,3Bxb6,b'6k1/5pbp/pB1N2p1/2p5/2P1P3/1Pq2PPB/P3Q2P/5K2 b - -',? These queenside pawns were not doing anything for anyone and now White's DSB is at least two moves from doing anything productive. White underestimates Black's chances for counterplay with only a Bishop and Queen and this move wastes valueable time. Better is 31.e5! Bxe5 32.f4 Bd4 (or 32...Qa1+ 33.Kg2 Bd4) 33.Qe8+ Kg7 34.Nf5+ gxf5 35.Be5+ simplifying to a winning endgame for White and keeping a firm hold on the initiative. The text move allows Black to claw his way into the driver's seat.
364,11,35,3Bd4,b'6k1/5p1p/pB1N2p1/2p5/2PbP3/1Pq2PPB/P3Q2P/5K2 w - -',! This seemingly-simple move is the first in a series of tricks that Black has up his sleeve. The d-file is now closed off so nothing can get across to attack the Black King and nothing can get home to defend the White King.
365,11,36,3Bc8,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB1N2p1/2p5/2PbP3/1Pq2PP1/P3Q2P/5K2 b - -',"?! I think it was more accurate to play 32.f4. White needs an escape route for his King through this forest of ""friendly"" pawns or the BQ will start rampaging through the White queenside. The text gives the King some luft but 32.f4 would prevent ...g5! after 32...Qa1+ 33.Kg2 Qg1+ Kf3 whereas the text offers no defense against the Black pawns."
366,11,37,3Kg2,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB1N2p1/2p5/2PbP3/1P3PP1/P3Q1KP/q7 b - -',If 33.Qe1 Black can start chewing through White pawns as he pleases.
367,11,38,3g5,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB1N4/2p3p1/2PbP3/1P3PP1/P3Q1KP/q7 w - -',!? This pawn thrust is surprisingly dangerous cutting off the escape square h4 and threatening ...h5 to lock the WK away in his corner.
368,11,39,3Nf5,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB6/2p2Np1/2PbP3/1P3PP1/P3Q1KP/q7 b - -',White hopes in vain to trade off the cruel Bishop.
369,11,40,Be5,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB6/2p1bNp1/2P1P3/1P3PPK/P3Q2P/6q1 w - -',Somehow black's important pawns are still defended and the WQ is no closer to her Black-crowned target across the board. White's two Bishops each wish they could be nearly as useful as Black's single one.
370,11,41,3Qd2,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB6/2p1bNp1/2P1P3/1P3PPK/P2Q3P/6q1 b - -',? 36.f4 would be much stronger here but again White's inaccuracies give Black just enough breathing room to fight on and keep setting up traps. White still hasn't really comprehended how many ways Black can almost mate him--one more misstep and he'll be done for despite the material lead.
371,11,42,3Kg4,b'2B3k1/5p1p/pB6/2p1bNp1/2P1P1K1/1P3PP1/P2Q3P/5q2 b - -',White is still reluctant to attempt to trade off the Queens with 37.Qg2 even though it would give him a clearly won endgame.

374,11,45,3Nh6+,b'2B3k1/5p2/pB5N/2p1b1Kp/2P1P3/1P3qP1/P2Q3P/8 b - -',White has to be extremely careful now. For instance 39...Kg7 40.Qd8?? Bf6+ 41.Qxf6+ Qxf6+ 42.Kxh5 Qxh6+ 43.Kg4 Qxb6 and Black has an easy win or 39.Kg7 40.Bf5?? (to defend e4 and cut off the BQ from the BK) 40...Bf6#!
375,11,46,3Kh7,b'2B5/5p1k/pB5N/2p1b1Kp/2P1P3/1P3qP1/P2Q3P/8 w - -',? This allows the White Bishop to interpose on f5 with check preventing mate on f6. Better was an immediate 39...Kg7.
376,11,47,Kg7,b'8/5pk1/pB5N/2p1bBKp/2P1P3/1P3qP1/P2Q3P/8 w - -',The Kings glare at each other surrounded by their most trusted soldiers. The position is extremely sharp; each one knows that a single misstep will mean their demise.
377,11,48,4Bd8,b'3B4/5pk1/p6N/2p1bBKp/2P1P3/1P3qP1/P2Q3P/8 b - -',This is actually one of very few ways for White to avoid significant material loss or checkmate (eg. 41.Qd7?? Bf6#). 
378,11,49,4Kh4,b'3B4/6k1/p4p1N/2p1bB1p/2P1P2K/1P3qP1/P2Q3P/8 b - -',Of course White cannot recapture with the Bishop or he loses immediately.
379,11,50,4Bxg3+,b'3B4/6k1/p4p1N/2p2B1p/2P1P2K/1P3qb1/P2Q3P/8 w - -',The last hurrah but there are no more serious mate threats left--now it's just a question of how much material he can force White to give up before the BQ finally runs out of steam.
380,11,51,4Qf4,b'3B4/6k1/p4p1N/2p4p/2P1qQ1K/1P4PB/P7/8 b - -',White finally figures out that he should have traded Queens long ago.
381,11,52,Kg6,b'8/8/p4Bk1/2p4p/2P2P1K/1P5B/P7/8 w - -',1-0. Black put up a terrific fight at a significant material disadvantage and graciously resigns when he runs out of complications.

383,12,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Most popular answer. Also Bc5 is playable!
384,12,2,Nd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1B1pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Normal move in this position is Ne4 but to escape the theory books Nd7 is a good alternative
385,12,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1BbpP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',In my opinion Be7 would lead to a equal game but with Bc5 the game is different and I think white has more chances

387,12,5,1Nc3,b'rnb1k2r/p1p1qppp/2p5/3pP3/3N4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Now black has lost a tempo with the knight and white has an opportunity to gain some space advantage

397,13,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',? I play the Advance Variation in the French Defense! Maybe not the best move according to Gameknots own Database. Better was Nc3 or Nd2!
398,13,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',A very common pawn-push in this and similar positions. Black tries to attack the base in Whites pawn chain here the pawn at d4!
399,13,3,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My standard response to c5. All other alternatives I´m seeing as weaker with the risk of getting a weak pawn and all such drawbacks!
400,13,4,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A very weak move according to the Gameknot Database! Giving me a somewhat easier play. Better was Nc6 or Qb6!
401,13,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -', Now comes Nc6!

Although the direct rules are less useful than general understanding I believe these rules/principles are the MOST important in chess and you can use them to help you find the best move in many positions.
508,17,5,1Rxd8+,b'2bR1k2/ppN1nppp/2n5/2b5/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/2K2BNR b - -',Principle of Neutralization: States that we should decrease the opponent's activity if we can. Right now white forces the knight to go back decreasing its activity. 
509,17,6,1Nf3,b'2bn1k2/ppN1nppp/8/2b5/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/2K2B1R b - -',Principle of Greatest/Maximum Activity. We should always if we can make moves that increase the activity in our own position by the maximum amount possible. Therefore moving pieces that are inactive to more active squares will help. Obviously a ver weak piece going to a great square is the best.
510,17,7,1Bxf2,b'2bn1k2/ppN1nppp/8/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2bPP/2K2B1R w - -',Principle of material: If we can take a material we should do it. That is a principle however and principles tell us only moves we should put into our candidate moves not play them immediately. For exampleyou could take a pawn and let your opponent destroy your position. You will put taking the pawn on the list but after you see that it destroy's your position you will reject it. This is not the case here by the way. I am just stating an important fact. By the way when considering taking material and you arrive at a n unclear line which is not really that badbut not so good for you just always take the material if you are sure you analyzed correctly. Many players try to see deeper thinknig about all sorts of things; This just confuses them and they have doubts about the position and their understanding of it. If anything is unclear always go for your instinct: Your instinct is to play the unclear line since you decided to look at it. If it is an unclear dubious line then maybe you should not play it.

512,17,9,Bd4,b'2b2k2/ppN2ppp/2n5/5n2/2Bb1B2/5N2/PPP3PP/2K2R2 w - -',principle of fear- In positions that are messy and complicated we should not feel scared(We will but we should not let thaat affect our moves). Just always use your calculation and thought process in those positions and always try to make attacks if you can. Making attacks will scare your opponent who may blunder.
513,17,10,Be6,b'6k1/ppN2Rpp/2nBb3/8/2Bn4/8/PPP3PP/2K5 w - -',"Principle of not playing the best move:)- When you are in a very bad position it is better to play ""Hopeful Chess"" than to play the best move. Here you can play a tricky move hoping your opponent to make a blunder letting you back in. If he finds the best move it does not matter. What matters is that you give him the greatest chance to slip up."

I do not feel I was over confident. Maybe moving too fast or I was looking at something else. Him moving his queen was something that should have made me alert and vigilant. But I let the game go. Not to say I have not done the exact same thing to other guys. I have. Seems to be a real problem with guys who hover under 1400 (like myself). I think it is some sort of fatigue almost. Tunnel vision and lack of drive in the game we are playing.

In this game I have been guilty of pawn grabbing and GM Cyrano ensured that my second game against him ended in a rout - in his favour!  I thought it was OK to grab a pawn because the queens were traded off prior to that so I did not have to worry about Henry copping Old Matey.  Still the rooks were on the board and Cyrano's pieces were better developed than my own and he took full advantage of this fact.  Here is how the drama unfolded.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17572831&rnd=0.30321710962631215"

Whichever square Henry chooses to go to it will allow a knight fork either on c3 or d3.  I realised that one move later and waved the white flag.  It was just so amazing how quickly a seemingly OK position can fall apart in the space of a couple of moves!

693,24,12,1Rdg1,b'r4rk1/3n1ppp/pqpp1n2/1p2p1B1/4P2P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',Game on. Everything White has is aimed at the BK.
694,24,13,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/3n1ppp/pqpp4/1p2p1Bn/4P2P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR w - -',Black adds a defender for g7 momentarily but this Knight is destined for f4 in an attempt to shut the WQ out of the attack or force a trade to lessen the pressure.
695,24,14,1Be7,b'r4rk1/3nBppp/pqpp4/1p2p2n/4P2P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',Not only the Rook is in danger here--moving that Rook invites 16.Bxf7+ or 16.Qh6! with a huge attack.
696,24,15,1Nf4,b'r4rk1/3nBppp/pqpp4/1p2p3/4Pn1P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR w - -',! This sacrifice shuts down White's attack entirely for if 16.Bxf8 Rxf8 White has exchanged a powerful aggressive piece for an entirely passive one of his opponent's. 15...Nf4! also shuts the WQ out of the attack and thanks to the doubled pawns it is completely untouchable without at least an even exchange--which is to say a favorable exchange for Black.
697,24,16,1Bxf8,b'r4Bk1/3n1ppp/pqpp4/1p2p3/4Pn1P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',? I think 16.Bxd6 or 16.Bg5 followed by Bxf4 would have been much better. White wins the exchange but effectively forfeits his aggressive options and can no longer do anything at all about Black's Nf4.
698,24,17,1Nxf8,b'r4nk1/5ppp/pqpp4/1p2p3/4Pn1P/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR w - -',Leaving the Rook on the queenside to create problems for White and relocating the Knight to a more useful spot where it can reach g6 or e6.
699,24,18,1h5,b'r4nk1/5ppp/pqpp4/1p2p2P/4Pn2/PBPP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',White continues to press but he doesn't really have any way to proceed.
700,24,19,1Bxe6,b'r5k1/5ppp/pqppB3/1p2p2P/4Pn2/P1PP1P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',?! This Bishop was a critical piece of White's remaining kingside aggression. White is perhaps hoping for 18...Nxe6?? 19.Qh6 but he's not that lucky.
701,24,20,1d4,b'r5k1/6pp/pqppp3/1p2p2P/3PPn2/P1P2P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR b - -',Trying to remove the e5 pawn defending the Black Knight.
702,24,21,1Rd8,b'3r2k1/6pp/pqppp3/1p2p2P/3PPn2/P1P2P2/2PQ1P2/2K3RR w - -',If 20.dxe4 dxe4 and there's no way for White to get rid of the pawn defending Black's bothersome Knight.
703,24,22,2Rg3,b'3r2k1/6pp/pqppp3/1p2p2P/3PPn2/P1P2PR1/2PQ1P2/2K4R b - -',Preparing to double Rooks on the g-file and thunder down on the BK.
704,24,23,2Rg4,b'3r3k/6pp/pqppp3/1p2p2P/3PPnR1/P1P2P2/2PQ1P2/2K4R b - -',?! White seems prepared to take the Knight by force giving back his material advantage if he has to--he simply has no way to make headway against the BK without his Queen in the picture. Look at that pretty white cage she's trapped in.
705,24,24,2Qa5,b'3r3k/6pp/p1ppp3/qp2p2P/3PPnR1/P1P2P2/2PQ1P2/2K4R w - -',With the obvious threat of ...Qxa3+ and suddenly Black will have an attack that White can neither ignore nor properly defend.
706,24,25,2Kb2,b'3r3k/6pp/p1ppp3/qp2p2P/3PPnR1/P1P2P2/1KPQ1P2/7R b - -',The only way for White to shore up a3 and c3.
707,24,26,2c5,b'3r3k/6pp/p2pp3/qpp1p2P/3PPnR1/P1P2P2/1KPQ1P2/7R w - -',Black threatens to win at least a pawn with ...cxd4 as White cannot retake; his c-pawn is pinned to his undefended Queen. Additionally the weak c3 pawn itself is coming under fire.
708,24,27,2Rhg1,b'3r3k/6pp/p2pp3/qpp1p2P/3PPnR1/P1P2P2/1KPQ1P2/6R1 b - -',I think 23.Qe3 might have been stronger here to prevent Black's onrushing queenside incursion but now White's battery is prepared and he invites Black to play ...Nxh5? defending g7 and winning a pawn--anything to get that Knight off of f4 because if that happens White's forces spring back to life in an instant.
709,24,28,2cxd4,b'3r3k/6pp/p2pp3/qp2p2P/3pPnR1/P1P2P2/1KPQ1P2/6R1 w - -',! This pawn is worth much more than the h-pawn (especially since 23...Nxh5? is met by 24.Qg5! g6 25.Rh1 with a winning attack (thanks to tiger_lilov for the continuation)). Black is also looking to force a trade of Queens and with the WQ gone and no more reason to block that diagonal Black's heroic Knight will have one final blow to deal to the White forces--24.Rxg7?? dxc3+! 25.Qxc3 Qxc3+ 26.Kxc3 Ne2+!
710,24,29,2Kb3,b'3r3k/6pp/p2pp3/qp2p2P/3pPnR1/PKP2P2/2PQ1P2/6R1 b - -',The only way to avoid Black forcing the Queens off the board.
711,24,30,2Qxc3,b'3r3k/6pp/p2pp3/qp2p2P/4PnR1/PKQ2P2/2P2P2/6R1 b - -',?? I debated rating this only a mistake but I really think this is the blunder that costs White the game. After this exchange he will be behind in material and have a vastly inferior pawn structure. 25.Qe3 would have been a far better choice threatening to get behind the Black lines to deadly effect with Qa7.
712,24,31,Rc8,b'2r4k/6pp/p2pp3/1p2p2P/1K2P3/P4P2/2P2P2/6R1 w - -',Now it's down to a Rook-and-Pawn endgame--White has an advantage in superior King placement but his pawns are tremendously vulnerable and Black has the initiative.
713,24,32,3Rc1,b'2r3k1/6pp/p2pp3/1p2p2P/1K2P3/P1P2P2/5P2/2R5 b - -',Threatening c3-c4 and Rc3 trading off a weak White pawn for a strong Black one.
714,24,33,3d5,b'2r3k1/6pp/p3p3/1p1pp2P/1K2P3/P1P2P2/5P2/2R5 w - -',Black invites White to further cripple himself by undoubling the Black e-pawns and isolating the already-weak White f-pawns. This move also forestalls c3-c4.
715,24,34,Rc4+,b'6k1/6pp/p3p3/1p1pp2P/1Kr1P3/P1P2P2/5P2/3R4 w - -',Defending the d-pawn with style.
716,24,35,3Kb3,b'6k1/6pp/p3p3/1p1pp2P/2r1P3/PKP2P2/5P2/3R4 b - -',32.Ka5 Ra4+ 33.Kb6 d4 isn't much better.
717,24,36,3cxd4,b'6k1/6pp/p3p3/1p2p2P/2rPP3/PK3P2/5P2/3R4 b - -',White doesn't have much choice in the matter.
718,24,37,3a4,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p2p2P/P1rpP3/1K1R1P2/5P2/8 b - -',?? White overlooks that the Rook can capture without any detriment to Black's position. He was already lost but this clinches it as now Black will have passed pawns on both sides of the board.
719,24,38,3f4,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p2p2P/r2pPP2/1K1R4/5P2/8 b - -',A good try isolating the d-pawn and setting White's e-pawn free.
720,24,39,Rc4,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p5P/2rpPp2/1K3R2/5P2/8 w - -',Black prevents the WK from coming near the d-pawn.
721,24,40,d3,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p5P/2r1PR2/1K1p4/5P2/8 w - -',Advancing with a pin on e4. 
722,24,41,3Rf5,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p3R1P/2r1P3/1K1p4/5P2/8 b - -',If now 39...Rxe4 40.Rd5 and the passed pawns are traded off--still a winning endgame for Black but he has a simpler resource...
723,24,42,3Rd4,b'6k1/6pp/p7/1p3R1P/3rP3/1K1p4/5P2/8 w - -',This forces White to exchange Rooks in order to stop Black from promoting. Once there are only Kings left Black will have an easy time queening on one flank or the other.
724,24,43,Kf7,b'8/5kpp/p7/1p1P3P/8/8/2Kp1P2/8 w - -',Black leaves the WK tied down at the edge of the board while he mobilizes his own.
725,24,44,4Kd4,b'8/6pp/p2k4/1p1P3P/3K4/8/5P2/8 b - -',White has the opposition but Black has a huge advantage--two connected passed pawns just out of reach.
726,24,45,4h6,b'8/6pp/3k3P/1p1P4/p2K1P2/8/8/8 b - -',Desperation sets in. Even if Black foolishly plays 47...gxh6 White still loses the race to promote: 48.f5 a3 49.f6 a2 50.a7 a1=Q+ and Black cleans up the game in short order.
727,24,46,4g6,b'8/7p/3k2pP/1p1P4/p2K1P2/8/8/8 w - -',0-1. It's over for White; he loses either the d- or f-pawn next turn (with 48.Kc3 or 48.f5 respectively) and Black's queenside pawns will tie up the White King with perfect immunity (if the King takes the rear pawn he cannot catch the other one) while the BK escorts the g-pawn to the queening square.

I had another game with a long-standing nemisis known as The Dentist.  Do not be fooled by his current rating.  He reached an optimum of over 1400 and I still maintain he is capable of getting to 1500 were it not for the fact that he regularly visits Vietnam which may not have a good internet connection and therefore he has suffered a lot of timeouts.  Make no mistake at the top of his game he is a serious threat and I have had one loss a few low draws and several near misses against him - that is why I play against him unrated.  Just have a look at my annotations ""In the Dentist's Chair and The Dentist has his Day to see why.  Thankfully since the loss I had against him I have hardly allowed him to breathe and I just hope I can continue to crush him like I did in this game.  Here is how it happened: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17550343&rnd=0.45702334734048733.  I decided to deviate from my normal e4 and play something else.

846,31,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',3. e5 - pawn cramp - already takes away the black knight's best square f6.
847,31,2,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/4p1p1/3pP3/1b1P1P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',4. ...... Bb4+ - this check is a waste because that bishop can be driven back immediately with c3.
848,31,3,Be3,b'rnbqk1nr/1pp2p2/p3p1pp/b2pP3/3P1P2/2PBBN2/PP4PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',8. Be3 - over the last few moves I have concentrated fully on development.
849,31,4,1Nbd2,b'rnb1k1nr/2p1qp2/p3p1pp/bp1pP3/3P1P2/2PBBN2/PP1N2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',10. Nbd2 - and I continue to clear the decks.
850,31,5,Bb7,b'r3k1nr/1bpnqp2/p3p1pp/bp1pP3/3P1P2/2PBBN2/PPQN2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',11. ...... Bb7 - black is playing well here.  I do not have a plan but I do have the seed of a plan here.  I am thinking about Concordborn's Sicilian MT in which I used a4 as a pawn break to beat Concordborn (Matthew).  I eventually got a decisive passed pawn on the a column and eventually went on to win the exchange.  Maybe I could utilise that plan in this game to good effect.
851,31,6,1a4,b'r3k1nr/1bpnqp2/pb2p1pp/1p1pP3/PP1P1P2/2PBBN2/2QN2PP/R4RK1 b kq a3',13. a4 - here it is!
852,31,7,1f6,b'r3k1nr/1bpnq3/pb2pppp/1p1pP3/PP1P1P2/2PBBN2/2QN2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',13.  ....... f6?! - not sure about this move maybe black had been better served by playing 0-0-0.  I now have the choice between BxP+ and axb5.  I decided on the latter - at least this leaves the former threat open.
853,31,8,Nxa6,b'r3k1nr/2p1q3/nb2pppp/3pP3/1P1P1P2/2P1BN2/2QN2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',16. ..... Nxa6 - this plethora of exchanges leaves a knight in a pin which can be exploited by ......
854,31,9,1b5,b'r3k1nr/2p1q3/nb2pppp/1P1pP3/3P1P2/2P1BN2/2QN2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',17. b5!
855,31,10,1Nxe5,b'r3k1nr/2p1q3/nb2p1pp/1P1pN3/3P1P2/2P1B3/2QN2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',18. Nxe5 - I leave the knight on the board as it still cannot escape without the rook on a8 being taken for starters.  This move now threatens Nxg6.  I have threats on both sides of the board.  My opponent times out but gameknot analysis shows that I am winning hands down.  Freddy if you had the black pieces here how would you continue this game?  Can you turn the tables on me - this is your challenge.  Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read.  Kind regards - Joanne

My buddy ab15 and I talked a bit about this game and felt that there were quite a few twists and turns to it - games like this are very much annotation fodder methinks.  I attach Gameknot Analysis here so that you can all follow the game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17128894&rnd=0.7754117956706019"
891,33,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',3. d4 - this game is called the Scotch Game.  The first time I played this opening on Gameknot was my first game against an Expert - my coach Ionadowman.  That game which I lost was called Battle of the Wings which went like this .....http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/challenge-from-jstevens1-battle-of-the-wings?gm=10633
892,33,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',4. ..... Nf6 - black eschews a knight trade on d4 - he does not wish to bring the WQ out onto a central square which is difficult to assail.
893,33,3,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nc3 - development and defense of e4.
894,33,4,bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',6. ....... bxc6 - a knight trade which shatters black's queenside.  Can white take full advantage though?  Only time will tell.
895,33,5,Bg5,b'r1bqr1k1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/6B1/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',9. Bg5 - pin.

898,33,8,cxd5,b'r1bq2k1/p1pprpp1/7p/3pP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',13. ..... cxd5 - and now we have a plethora of exchanges.  Black is still left with a fractured queenside despite these exchanges and now white must defend his pawn on e5.
899,33,9,Qxd6,b'r1b3k1/p1p1rpp1/3q3p/3p4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',15. Qxd6 - and now this pawn trade does tidy up black's queenside a bit.  On the minus side black has an isolated a pawn but on the plus side an open b file?  Which is better only time will tell.  White now connects his rooks by moving his queen to f3.
900,33,10,1c4,b'r5k1/p1pqrpp1/4b2p/3p4/2P5/3B1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - c3',18. c4 - look out black look out your queen is on the same file as a WR and there is a bishop itching to lump a check on h7 if you play PXP??  I also forgot to mention that there is a black rook hanging on a8 to the WQ should white miss this check so the d5 pawn is doubly pinned!
901,33,11,1Bg4,b'r5k1/p1pqrpp1/7p/3p4/2P3b1/3B1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',18. ...... Bg4 - black avoids this by a counter-attack on the WQ.  In fact this queen is skewered to the QR.
902,33,12,2Rxc7,b'r5k1/p1R2pp1/7p/3p4/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/3b2K1 b - -',21. Rxc7 - after this tactical stouche white is a pawn up but black has something up his sleeve .....
903,33,13,2Re8,b'4r1k1/p1R2pp1/7p/3p4/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/3b2K1 w - -',21. .... Re8 - by conjouring up that chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey.  Old Matey just lurves those back rows and corridors.  Black must also watch out for Old Matey however because a WB covers the b1 - h7 diagonal cutting off the BK's escape.
904,33,14,2Bxc4,b'4r1k1/p1R2pp1/7p/8/2B5/7P/PP3PP1/3b2K1 b - -',23. Bxc4 - black gets rid of his isolated QP by trading it off with white's c pawn.  He still remains a pawn down and his a pawn is very weak.  He must do something special or he is toast.
905,33,15,Rc2,b'6k1/R4pp1/7p/7b/2B5/1P5P/P1r2PPK/8 w - -',26. ..... Rc2 - black decided to give white a dose of his own medicine - a bone in the throat.
906,33,16,3a5,b'5k2/R5p1/7p/P4p1b/2B5/1P3PKP/1r4P1/8 b - -',30. a5 - white looks as though he is winning hands down but he will be on the losing side.  It will be interesting to see just how he loses from here.
907,33,17,3g5,b'5k2/R7/7p/P4ppb/2B5/1P3PKP/1r4P1/8 w - g6',30. ...... g5 - black tries a pawn roll.  Maybe the WK looks a little vulnerable.
908,33,18,3a6,b'5k2/R7/P6p/5ppb/2B5/1P3PKP/1r4P1/8 b - -',31. a6 - white just cannot wait to crown his pawn.  It is this that will be his undoing.  He finds his king caught in a Noah's Ark trap and a black pawn now forces his king to h2 where the g2 pawn will be pinned.
909,33,19,Bxf3,b'5k2/R7/P6p/6p1/2B2p2/1P3b1P/1r4PK/8 w - -',32.  ..... Bxf3 - black takes advantage of the pin on g2 to win a pawn back.  Now black threatens Rxg2+.
910,33,20,3a7,b'5k2/P1R5/7p/6p1/4bp2/1r5P/6PK/5B2 b - -',35. a7 - nacht.
911,33,21,4Rxh6,b'8/P7/7R/4k1p1/4bp2/7P/r5PK/5B2 b - -',40. Rxh6 - white is now a pawn up again but black can now take advantage yet again of the white g2 pawn being pinned.  Black can advance his f pawn.
912,33,22,Kd4,b'8/P7/4R3/6p1/3kb3/5p1P/r5PK/5B2 w - -',41. ..... Kd4 - if KxR?? then Bc4+ winning back the BR.  This will mean that black will have to give up his bishop to avoid a crowning on a8.
913,33,23,fxg2,b'8/P7/4R3/2k3p1/4b3/7P/r5pK/5B2 w - -',43. .... fxg2 - oooh this is looking nasty for white.  A deadly discovered check is threatened.
914,33,24,Rh1+,b'8/P7/Bk6/6R1/4b3/7P/6pK/7r w - -',46. ..... Rh1+ - white's only move is Kg3 which will allow the pawn to crown on g1 with check.  White therefore resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Black's rating is now 1682 and he will hopefully get to 1700.  Well played black.
915,34,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',2.Nf3Nc3c3are the most popular moves in the Sicilian variation  (  if 2.Nf3 it can be dragon  nijdorff classical. if 2.Nc3 it is closed Sicilian . and 2. c3 this called Alapin variation

917,34,2,Nh3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P1PQ2/7N/P1PP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',its not so good spot for the knight  7.Nf3-g6.8.Bb2-Bg7.9.Nc3 -0-0.10.0-0-Bd7  and blacks position is better but at least white finished its development

Both players have been following the main opening goals and now white ventures away from the general line with 6.exd4. At the point when we get out of book we need to be very careful and think how we will best complete our opening goals. Well it is actually quite simple: Nc6 d5 Bd6/e7/c5 0-0 and black is fine. This completes the tasks fast and gives black a good activity. So we have a way of following the principle of maximum acitivity as well as completing our goal.

The principle of pressure and important principle states that you should keep the pressure when 2 pieces are in contact(They are the same pieces) unless you can have a tactic. If there is no tactical manuever it is almost always giving your opponent the advantage since it lets them get more active. The only exception is when you take and force a piece backwards but that is also to some extent a dynamic benefit :).

However we can see that the capture gives away the stronger white bishop for the less effective black knight. It more importantly opens lines towards the white king. Such a move cannot be strong. Instead white could easily do 12.Nf3 with the principle of the least active piece. 
961,37,6,1Qh5,b'1rb1k2r/p1q2p2/2pbpp1p/3p3Q/8/1P1BP3/P1PN1PPP/R4RK1 b k -',"A very reasonable move; The maximum activity. White has now completed his opening tasks and is ready for the middlegame. Before we had NO NEED to calculate any variations really. The only calculation we needed to do was the safety check when considering ideas. Even then it was very brief. We really did not even need to use our full thought process since we planned out our ideas and they were obvious and followed the correct principles. However now we will need to use our thought process and find the best move in this critical position: **Whenever the structure or material has changed it is an important position and we need to make changes in our general plans.**
1.Our opponent's last move was reasonable and good. It puts some pressure against the black weaknesses. It is tactically safe and makes no threats;We can move on to our own ideas.
2.We would like to attack against the white king since we have open lines against it. We have massive center and bishop pair; Our king is quite safe in the center and we need to open the position for our bishops. So we need to put our king behind the center pawns while keeping them fluid; so don't move the pawns until you are ready.
3.Candidate moves. 3a)The queen has an attack 13...Qa5 but 14.Nf3 e5 is considerable. So we only have one with the queen. 3b)13...Rg8 activates the rook so it is candidate. 3c)13...Be5 is attacking but it clearly is not too great after 14.Rad1. Still we should consider this the last of our candidate moves. 3d)13...e5 is not a useful move. It restricts the activity of our pieces and allows 14.e4 at least. It is not good. 3e)King moves? Ke7-We should consider this lastly.  
4.Now we have found the candidates 4 moves. We should go from the potentially strongest to the weakest most forcing to non forcing. By the way all of these moves are safe :) I have inadvertantly calculated basic safety in step 3. So let us calculate 13...Be5 13...Rg8 13...Qa5 13...Ke7. 13...Be5 14.Rad1(no other considerable moves really) and the position has no more forcing moves. Thus we should evaluate: black should still be more active but with his 13th move he has not helped activity. White is close and has more pieces developed. Therefore white has gained in acitivty and is about equal or slightly worse. In material it is equal. thus the position is about equal after 13...Be5. Many players will try to think about doubled pawns the attack the king in the middle...etc... It just confuses them and they can't make a final judgement anyways. The 2 factors of activity and material will be the evaluation and it is extremely accurate in almost all the positions. Now we look at 13...Rg8. This is a very good looking move but it does give white a pawn. Since black has activated his rook and is clearly ahead in the activity department white MUST take the material. 14.Qxh6 Ke7 Now the position seems quiet and we should make the evaluation. However black does have a ""threat"". He threatens 15...B"

I used the rule: If there is a sacrifice(reasonable: Maybe an unclear or dubious at best) for activity play it on the board if it is safe. This is great against strong and weaker players alike. 1.It shows you are not afraid of them and are playing for their throat 2.Weaker players are frightened by aggressive sacrifices It is reasonable and gives quite a lot of activity. 
*By the way I am betting the computer does not like this move much! However even it may like this move in maybe 3rd or 4th place since it does have quite a lot of positional justification."

Since black has just attacked our rook and is threatening material we MUST save the material because if we are down material AND our opponent has better activity we are fightin a losin battle. Thus we MUST save the rook unless it is tactically losing. 18.Rae1/d1 are the candidates;Other lose quickly like g3. I don't think there is huge difference between the 2 but after 18...Rh8 19.Bh7(A must for the same reason) 19...Rbg8 white is losing. However he needed to psychologically be brave and play this likely losing line. In fact if 18.Rae1 then 20.e4! is a strong counterattack. Thus white needed to play this line even though it is clear advantage to black. Now even if black just takes the rook he is winning.

Now we need to use our calculation process again since it is critical. 1.Our opponent attacked us 2.We need to find a combination or retreat. That is it! The generalities don't count much in the tactical position! 3.Queen has nothing. Rook can give 2 checks but they obviously both don't work ...Rh4 is a candidate. 3....Bf2+ is a move that is it. We needed to find a good move that helps us in the position; Only 2 moves can do the trick. ...Bf2+ is more forcing. 21...Bf2+ 22.Rxf2 Rg8+ and mate follows. So it is the best move since it forceds mate.

1114,39,71,4Kd2,b'8/pp4pk/2pp4/5r1p/3Pp3/2P5/PP1K4/7n b - -',How about Rf3 followed by Ng3 with the promotion of the h-pawn.
1115,39,72,4d5,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r1p/3Pp3/2P5/PP1K4/7n w - -',First I'm going to create prolonged problems for White. Then I will create a mini version of the plan.
1116,39,73,4Ke1,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r1p/3Pp3/2P5/PP6/4K2n b - -',I know exactly where I want the King: on the back rank. 41...Rf2! Isolates the King from helping his pawns at the expense of a rook and a Knight. However I'll promote my h-pawn. 
1117,39,74,4h4,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/3Pp2p/2P5/PP6/4K2n w - -',I may as well stick with a less complex plan once again.
1118,39,75,4Ke2,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/3Pp2p/2P5/PP2K3/7n b - -',Now 42...Rf3 Isolates the King doesn't lose material and helps the Pawn promote!
1119,39,76,4h3,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/3Pp3/2P4p/PP2K3/7n w - -',I still go simple. I can't get any simpler than this.
1120,39,77,4b3,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/3Pp3/1PP4p/P3K3/7n b - -',43...b5 stops White's pawns dead in their tracks temporarily but I will just... keep... pushing... the pawn.
1121,39,78,4h2,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/3Pp3/1PP5/P3K2p/7n w - -',I will reroute the Knight to g3 or f2 but I think g3 is the better square.
1122,39,79,4c4,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/2PPp3/1P6/P3K2p/7n b - -',Don't care! Sorry White.
1123,39,80,4Ng3+,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p1r2/2PPp3/1P4n1/P3K2p/8 w - -',The end is coming up.
1124,39,81,Rf3+,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p4/2PPp3/1P2Krn1/P6p/8 w - -',Now the King is stuck on the first and second ranks.
1125,39,82,4Kd2,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p4/2PPp3/1P3rn1/P2K3p/8 b - -',Forced.
1126,39,83,4h1=Q,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3p4/2PPp3/1P3rn1/P2K4/7q w - -',Finally promotion and a mate in two.
1127,39,84,4cxd5,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3P4/3Pp3/1P3rn1/P2K4/7q b - -',I won't worry. It is too late.
1128,39,85,4Qg2+,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3P4/3Pp3/1P3rn1/P2K2q1/8 w - -',This is the end.
1129,39,86,4Ke1,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3P4/3Pp3/1P3rn1/P5q1/4K3 b - -',Anywhere in the back rank is fine so pick the most comfortable spot.
1130,39,87,4Rf1#,b'8/pp4pk/2p5/3P4/3Pp3/1P4n1/P5q1/4Kr2 w - -',In this game I performed a risky move and didn't play it right. Then I wound up in a serious predicament. Be careful about risky moves that you play in your chess games. Your position can only handle so much pressure from it. Here's a golden rule: When faced with a challenge look for a way but not a way out.
