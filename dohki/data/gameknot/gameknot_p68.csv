3,0,3,1Ra2,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pp5/2b1p3/PnP3PP/1Q3P2/RP1P4/1NB1KB1R b K -',Oh boy......White is obviously trying to rid the powerfully posted knight with a bad exchange sacrifice but he is doing himself little favors. If 14. Kd1 e4 15. Qc3 Re8 Black does have a dangerous attack but White can defend himself with ease and avoid any complications.
4,0,4,1Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1pp2q2/2b1p3/PnP3PP/1Q3P2/RP1P4/1NB1KB1R w K -',Black did not wish to take the rook at this point and has other ideas in mind. Actually the knight becomes very useful later on as we soon shall see.

7,0,7,1Ke2,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/1pp2q2/2b1p3/PnP3bP/1Q3P1R/RP1PK3/1NB2B2 b - -',Black's job becomes exponentially easier; 16. Rg3 attacking the dangerous bishop gives White better defensive chances. Now White loses his rook.
8,0,8,e4,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/1pp2q2/2b5/PnP1p2P/1Q3P1B/RP1PK3/1NB5 w - -',Merely threatens to win a piece but there is more to it than that....
9,0,9,2Bxc6,b'r3r1k1/p4ppp/1pB5/2b5/PnP4q/1Q6/RP1P4/1NBK4 b - -',My opponent obviously missed my next move or had anticipated it and knew that mate could only be avoided by sacrificing the queen. Effectively spells the end.

12,1,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Carlsen (who has only 3 sec on his clock) chooses an asymmetric reply the Nimzowitsch defense although it certainly won't be a defense this time!
13,1,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A perfectly normal and solid move even though 2. d4 would have been sharper
14,1,3,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',This is the first attacking move that I suppose needs to be done if your'e going to beat your opponent with only 30 sec on your clock. The only good reply had been 3. exd (3. e5 also OK) but....
15,1,4,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Gates is far too cautious and defends the pawn with the LSB blocking his d pawn

21,1,10,O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',a natural good move!

28,1,17,Qh2#,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/4N3/6n1/2NB4/PPPP1PPq/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',THE END :)
29,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with my usual.
30,2,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now in the past he had questions about the French Defense.  So I told him that this is that Defense.  @hiredgun112: The variation for the French is 1.e4 e6.
31,2,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',And I told him that this is the most common response to that defense and he said ok.  @hiredgun112: In general 2.d4 is most often played when black only his pawn one square on the first move.  So for example the most response for the Caro Kann which is 1.e4 c6 is 2.d4.  The logic behind this is that it opens up other lines and variations for an attack.
32,2,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a standard and developing move.  Note: I will not say anything else unless my student has questions or makes a mistake.  The idea behind this is that you don't want to over coach because it might cause you to make a suggestion which would actually be a mistake as I learned the hard way when I mentored someone.
33,2,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',The only thing which is a common move btw is that black now has to face a N pin.  Of course it's not a big deal if he finds the right move.  
34,2,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',I understand black's intentions at this point.  Normally this would be an ideal move and it also develops a central pawn which is just as important as developing a piece for central control.  The only problem here is that this move makes my pin quite serious.  At this point he has two options.  His first is not a bad way to break the pin and the move would be 3...h6 and afterwards this would happen.  4.Bh4 g5 5.Bg3 which does lose tempo for white.  But the problem is that after the retreats black is still not completely developed.  So best was 3...Be7 which is actually the most common way to break this kind of pin since it also develops another piece at the same time.  But because of this move I am going to attack his N so black is only going to have one way to defend it.
35,2,6,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pP1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',"?? Now he decides to break the pin.  But as I pointed out this is a blunder.  In that I told said I understand your intentions because it breaks the pin. In this position however best was 4...h6 and that also breaks the pin. The reason being is that was the only way to keep things safe and even because after that I have two choices. Either I exchange your N for my bishop so 4.Bxf6 4...Bxf6 or 4...gxf6. Or if I don't want to exchange I could retreat back so after 4...h6 then this would happen. 5.Bh4 g5 Bg3 and everything is safe.  That's because this move loses a piece for a pawn  And I also stated that it illustrates just how an important a position is because believe it or not what you just played would have been best a move earlier. So the lesson here is that what was or might have been good a move earlier is bad only one move later. And that where there's more to a story then meets the eye.  In other words ""Be a spectator of your game.""  In other words look at the entire board and not just one or two things.  "
36,2,7,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bp1p/4pB2/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',"?? This is a blunder on my part.  What happened here is that I got distracted because I just started a consultation thread in the Alt Chess Club which is similar and the same idea as ION's Group I Consultation thread in the ""Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run"" forum.  And some of my quizzes involved quizzes from GM Judit Polgar in which I've annotated a couple of her past games.  Between this and there I got distracted and made a mistake.  So black finds that error by retacking.  But in a private message I used the FEN Notation to show what would have happened had I not taken."
37,2,8,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/4pb2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',In the meantime I decide to continue developing with the idea being that I will soon be able to castle K side.
38,2,9,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pppb1p1p/4pb2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He also decides to develop.  The problem however is that this move crams his LSB.  He got it out but there's not a lot of space to maneuver.  The thing is that mobility becomes a problem since there won't be a whole lot of movement with his LSB and mobility is one of the most important aspects of chess.
39,2,10,Bd3,b'rn1qk2r/pppb1p1p/4pb2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Having said that I'm still continuing to develop and am planning to castle.  One way of doing so is by bringing my bishop into play.
40,2,11,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbp1p/4p3/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',I don't know why he played this.  But @hiredgun112: Best was 8...Nc6 completing development without putting your N on the rim.  The idea being is that in general as a guideline it's not a good idea to move the same piece twice in the beginning.  That's because instead you can use that time to develop but moving something more then once gives your opponent the opportunity to continue with development on his or her next move.
41,2,12,O-O,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbp1p/4p3/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Having said that now I decide to castle here which I had planned for two moves.
42,2,13,c5,b'rn1qk2r/pp1bbp1p/4p3/2pp4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq c6',While it's not all that bad black plays with the idea being to force an exchange.  And I'm about to accept it which doesn't affect the game in any way since material level is even.  The only thing is that better is still the immediate ...Nc6 for development.
43,2,14,1Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1p1p/4p3/2bpN3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',"While it is generally better to use time to develop as opposed to moving the same piece more then once it's just as important to think and plan ahead.  And here that is what I was trying teach my student.  I have in the next few moves but the plan isn't to trick like you'd normally see with any regular cheapo tactics.  But the idea behind this cheapo or straightforward threat as you'd call it is to quiz him.  What I like to do is quiz my students by making threats most which are pretty easy to drive off.  The reason that I do this is to teach them the importance of being your own spectator and thinking ahead.  Like do you see that threat?  I got this idea mainly from those quizzes by GM Judit Polgar where she'll quiz her viewers to make sure that they really understand the positions.  Now those quizzes have helped me and a few of her viewers to make significant improvements which is how you know that she's a very good coach and mentor despite not playing against her.  Well the same idea applies here but it actually involves a real active game.  And the good news is that he is going to pass with flying colors.  It starts off with this move and in it he says ""See the hole in the fence always makes me nervous.And my left to me feels vulnerable.Going to move rook to g8 next.Been taught open ground that is not properly covered can turn into ""deadly"" ground"".  So I respond by saying lets see how that plays out. That move should work but the idea is ""Don't get nervous"" as my coach would say. But I like your thinking and the idea is to focus and concentrate on the positions."
44,2,15,1Ba4,b'rn1qk2r/pp3p1p/4p3/2bpN3/b7/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',! Good move.  This time however castling is a bad idea because it would lead to mate shortly after 12.Qh5.  However that is something that I'll play but because of this choice I don't have a chance to mate him.  This makes me proud of hiredgun112.  While this is not the real quiz and the real deal comes on my next move btw it's a small but important part which he sees ahead.  This is my goal.  In other words my intention to teach him to think and plan several moves ahead.  I know how difficult it really is but putting a student in a situation like this often makes this lesson fun to learn.  And I like to make learning a fun and enjoyable experience.
45,2,16,1Qh5,b'rn1qk2r/pp3p1p/4p3/2bpN2Q/b7/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',But this move is the real quiz.  And black accurately sees that with this mating threat 12...Rg8?? will not work.
46,2,17,1Rf8,b'rn1qkr2/pp3p1p/4p3/2bpN2Q/b7/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w q -',And he found the correct move.  In it I said correct.  BTW the thing about this move is that it was a quiz which you passed with flying color because any other move would lead to mate. Note: One way in which I teach is by quizzing students. Here I do that by creating a threat which is generally difficult to defend against. The idea is to get one thinking to make him or her think because that's extremely important in chess and in life. The more you think about a situation the better off you'll be in a game.
47,2,18,1Nc3,b'rn1qkr2/pp3p1p/4p3/2bpN2Q/b7/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b q -',So after the quiz I finally decide to bring my last piece and complete development.  But there's one move that I should have made first.  Better was to take his pawn with 13.Qxh7.  Of course I overlooked that but my idea here is to show black what the minor pieces can do in a game.  Note: It's still not too late for him to develop his remaining N.
48,2,19,1Bd4,b'rn1qkr2/pp3p1p/4p3/3pN2Q/b2b4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w q -',?? This is a blunder which I forgot to bring out.  @hiredgun112: That's because this move loses a piece because if you take back you'll find your position in serious trouble in the next few moves.  Best was 13...Bd7 so that if 14.Nxd7 you can take back with 14...Nxd7 and it's just an even exchange (meaning: that everything is still even).  But with this move I win a piece and this time there's no compensation.
49,2,20,Qa5,b'rn2kr2/pp3p1p/4p3/q2pN2Q/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w q -',Of course black is hoping and attempting to win my N.  This time I will allow it with the idea being that if he takes I get a couple of pawns after placing him in check.  What I overlooked however is his f8 R so letting him take is actually a mistake as it would allow him to compensate for a lost piece.
50,2,21,1Rae1,b'rn2kr2/pp3p1p/4p3/q2pN2Q/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b q -',So I decide to bring my N into action.  Now taking on a4 would be a mistake because if 15...Qxa4? this would happen 16.Qxh7.  And on my next move the plan would be to play Nxf7 with the idea being that if he then responds with ...Rxf7 I put him in a nasty check with a mating sequence several moves after Qh8+.
51,2,22,1Ke7,b'rn3r2/pp2kp1p/4p3/q2pN2Q/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',?? In this position best was bring his remaining N out even though it means he'd have to exchange when behind.  The problem with this move is that it exposes his K. Because of this move I am planning to find a mating sequence in the next move so this move might cost him the game.  My idea is to illustrate why it's a bad to expose your K.
52,2,23,1Qg5+,b'rn3r2/pp2kp1p/4p3/q2pN1Q1/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',My plan starts with this move.
53,2,24,1f6,b'rn3r2/pp2k2p/4pp2/q2pN1Q1/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',As I expected.  Normally this would be a problem for me since my N and Q is attacked.  But I already anticipated this for about 2-3 moves and now that he attacked my Q and N I know how to get out of that and that is by placing him back in check.
54,2,25,Rf7,b'rn6/pp2krQp/4pp2/q2pN3/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',"?? Normally this is an ideal so I wouldn't play it normally.  But what's normally good is a very serious blunder here.  In that he accurately said ""DANG fell for that.should went Ke7-Ke8"".  And my response was That's what I would have said to. Normally this move would be ideal because it usually attacks the Q so that black would have more time to develop attacks against the Q. But in this position best was 17...Ke8. Another option was also 17...Kd6 but that move would not be much better because it leaves the K exposed. This move however loses the R. The lesson here is that what might appear good can be bad. So you don't if a move is good unless you know what makes it good. That's the reason that why is the most common chess question.  "
55,2,26,Kd6,b'rn6/pp3Q1p/3kpp2/q2pN3/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',His only other option was 18...Kd8 and that move would have been a little better to alleviate his exposure.  Although either way his K is pretty exposed no matter how you slice it.  And this is the move that I had anticipated.
56,2,27,1Qxf6,b'rn6/pp5p/3kpQ2/q2pN3/N2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',! So I take a pawn and while it looks like a blunder because it should give him compensation this move is good believe it or not.  Stay tuned.
57,2,28,1Qxa4,b'rn6/pp5p/3kpQ2/3pN3/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',"?? Now this move looks good and is a common response but for strategical reasons this move is quite bad.  In fact this is his losing blunder as it will allow me to mate in the next several moves.  In that I told him that In this case ""To take is a mistake"". That's not true now and it looks like I blundered in this position. But as noted earlier there's always more to a story then meets the eye. And white does have plans. The idea is to think ahead and this is extremely difficult as I know from experience. But it's very important to try and thinking is not only important in chess but it's also important in life.  That's because my plan is to mate him and this move will enable me to do just that."
58,2,29,2Nf7+,b'rn6/pp3N1p/3kpQ2/3p4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',!! So the plan starts here.  And no matter where he moves I have a mating sequence.  This time however instead of what I'd normally do I'm following elyhim's and realjimfrior's plan.  That when a student makes a this kind of error it's better to just go for it as opposed to show lienency.  That's because he or she won't learn if you just give them another chance because it's about playing based on your reflection.  That's especially true here because as it turns out hiredgun112 is going to play in a tourney.  And in a chess tournament the opponents are not going to show lienency if you make an error.  So this is good preparation for that.
59,2,30,2Kc5,b'rn6/pp3N1p/4pQ2/2kp4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',In this position his only other option was 20...Kc7 but I'm still going to place him in check with my next move.  And this how I would have done even if he had played Kc7 instead.
60,2,31,Kb6,b'rn6/pp2QN1p/1k2p3/3p4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',His only other option was 21...Kc7 but that would immediately lead to mate after 22.Rxe6#.  This move however keeps him in the game for one more move.
61,2,32,2Qd8+,b'rn1Q4/pp3N1p/1k2p3/3p4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',My initial goal in this position was to play 22.Rxe6+ and then 22...Ka5 would be forced.  My idea was then to win his and b pawn with 23.Qxb7.  But I overlooked something before I even played that which is why I didn't.  If instead 22.Rxe6 black can defend 22...Nc6 not only developing his last piece.  But he would have a chance of counter play.  Well this was something that I wasn't going to allow because as noted earlier he signed for an OTB tourney.  And people do not show mercy in that tournament.  So I was preparing him for that moment and had I allowed him to defend with his N that would have defeated the purpose as it shows him mercy and liency which wouldn't do him any favors.  But with this move white is going mate in one more move and there is no way around that.
62,2,33,2Kc5,b'rn1Q4/pp3N1p/4p3/2kp4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',In this position black only had one other option 22...Kc6.  No matter how you slice it however white now has a mate in one and it is with the exact same move 23.Qd6#.
63,2,34,2Qd6#,b'rn6/pp3N1p/3Qp3/2kp4/q2b4/3B4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',"After this game I gave my student a summary of the lessons for this game in a PM.  So as to speak I summed it up.  @hiredgun112: The moral is to ""Be a spectator of your game"" develop all of your pieces early that what looks good might be bad so think before you make a move and look at the consequences of your decisions try and study the positions look at the big picture and think steps ahead.  If you can remember these lessons I think that your rating will easily hit 1100."

66,3,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Slightly unusual reply.
67,3,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So this blunts the Bishop's scope.
68,3,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White decides to switch to the normal open variation after all.
69,3,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I usually meet Nf3 with Nc6 challenging the same central squares e5 and d4.

75,3,11,Qa5+,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/q5B1/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This check which also hits the bishop on g4. Now she can't put the queen in the way as I simply exchange queens and take the knight on d4 so the only way to save the pieces is....

Now the only way for Black to save the piece is Nxc6 and although black's position is not very good at least material balance is maintained for instance 8.	Nxc6	Qxc4 9. Na5 Qxe4+ 10.	Kf1 b6 11. Nb3	Bb7 12. f3 Qf5 was sasusa (1643) vs. chesshub (2339) which black won in 24.

95,3,31,1Ke7,b'r6r/p2pkppp/bpn1p3/8/2P1n3/NP2P3/P3N1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I connect my rooks. My king is quite safe in the centre with queens off the board.

108,3,44,2Kg1,b'r2r4/p2pk2p/bp2p3/5pp1/1nP5/NPN1P3/P5PP/2R3K1 b - -',Strange move. With queens on the board this would be a good safety move but in this position the kings are safe enough in the centre. Ke2 would have been better stopping my rook invasion which follows.
109,3,45,2d5,b'r2r4/p3k2p/bp2p3/3p1pp1/1nP5/NPN1P3/P5PP/2R3K1 w - d6',So I open the d file also possibly increasing the scope of my Ba6

115,3,51,2Bb7,b'r7/pb2k2p/1p2p3/1N3pp1/1nP5/N3P2P/P2r2P1/2R3K1 w - -',This stops that and threatens g2

117,3,53,2Rxg2+,b'r7/pb2k2p/1p2p3/1NP2pp1/1n6/N3P2P/P5r1/2R3K1 w - -',So g2 goes

128,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',By the looks of the two ratings black would be favored to win but this game actually turned out to be quite the match. I started off with my traditional opening.
129,4,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I provoke the pawn.

143,4,15,1Bg2,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/P2P1NP1/1PQN1PbP/2KR3R w - -',He goes for the rook.

146,4,18,1Rhe8,b'2krr3/ppp2ppp/5q2/8/2Pp1P2/P2P2P1/1PQ4P/2K1R1R1 w - -',...the rooks battle.
147,4,19,a6,b'2kr4/1pp2ppp/p4q2/8/Q1Pp1P2/P2P2P1/1P5P/2K1R3 w - -',Not the move I really expected.
148,4,20,2h4,b'2kr4/1pp2ppp/p4q2/8/Q1Pp1P1P/P2P2P1/1P6/2K1R3 b - h3',Probably not the move he expected. After I made this move my opponent told me how I could of instead converged on space e8. If I had done that it probably would of went this way:21. Re8 22. Rxe8 Qxe8+ 23. Qd8 Qxd7+ 24. Kxd7. Probably would of ended in a dead position eventually. Despite a missed opportunity I quickly found an alternative.
149,4,21,2Qb4,b'2kr4/1p3ppp/p1p2q2/8/1QPp1P1P/P2P2P1/1P6/2K1R3 b - -',I start preparing for the attack.

151,4,23,Kc7,b'5Q2/1pkr1ppp/p1p2q2/8/2Pp1P1P/P2P2P1/1P6/2K1R3 w - -',Would of been much better to move his rook to d8.
152,4,24,2Re8,b'4RQ2/1pkr1ppp/p1p2q2/8/2Pp1P1P/P2P2P1/1P6/2K5 b - -',Now I'm in a fantastic position to attack the king.

159,4,31,3b4,b'R1Q5/1r3pp1/pkp2q2/1p5p/1PPp1P1P/P2P2P1/8/2K5 b - b3',The king was now immobilized unable to escape thus black's options were limited but he could still of found a way to avoid checkmate if he played his cards carefully maybe by getting his Queen involved but it would not of been easy. I would of kept fighting if I was him but black does not see a way out and resigns and thus this wonderful game was over. I hope you enjoyed my very first annotation!

165,5,5,h5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5p1P/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',!? I know by experience that a normal developement doesn't get much so I try this move. The intention is to force somehow g6 being dangerous for black with a pawn in h5. It is NOT my intention to play h6 since then g6 would be very solid for black and white just lost tempoes. 
166,5,6,Nd5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/3n1p1P/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',Yes I know. 
167,5,7,Bg3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/3n1p1P/3P4/4PNB1/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',...? But this was a blunder. Bh2 was the right move and it doesent matter if black presses with Bh4 white just plays f3 and that's all. Of course I plan to castle queenside from h4. But I miss here the crushing f4. When I realized it I thought the best way to save the bishop was exf4 and wait for Nxf4. Black has the f column but white seems able to stand and get to castle queenside safely.

What you'll see shortly is some confusion and denial as to the pawn sacrifice and then the ensuing tension around that and a surprise ending. Annotated by inspecteur_snail as White.

408,13,4,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6B1/2pP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',As part of my blind rage I forgot to notice that Black had opened with Queen Bishop to d7 FIRST rather than the usual c6. Post game computer analysis gives Black a very slight edge for these two moves but what I didn't realize was that the difference was so negligible I should have just moved on with my life.
409,13,5,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6B1/1bpP4/5NP1/PPQNPPBP/R3K2R w KQkq -',At this point I realized Black didn't have any plans of his own and was equally focused on this pawn. Even more determination set in. But now I needed to remove this pin...

412,13,8,1Qxd4,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6B1/2pq4/6P1/PPQNPPBP/R4RK1 w kq -',Now I needed to pull my act together. How to remove this cursed pawn and get rid of this queen at the same time. What was burned in my mind was the exchange of kxc4 exacting my revenge black knight kxc4 in retribution and I'm screwed since the black queen would get the last word and be in troublesome position for me. But not if I could remove that extra coverage for the square on c4...

I moved the rook here to prevent the Black queen from getting the last word and capturing on b2 after the exchanges on c4 but forgot to notice White LSBxc6+ and a pawn recapture here means black is in for some punishment after the white queen x again on c6+ forking the rook on a8. Ah well. 

Instead the situation simply became more entrenched"

416,13,12,e5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1np5/4p3/2p1B3/4P1P1/PP1NP2P/1R3RK1 w kq -',After the exchange I'm now down 2 in material by accident and not in a perfect position. Basically I've caused more harm than good by now and am hoping for something to materialize. That black knight on b6 is really starting to earn it's weight in gold at this point. I *am* however happy about this semi-open f file since there are no queens and black has no DSB. I'm hoping I can leverage this in the future (foreshadowing).
417,13,13,1Bf5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1np5/4pB2/2p5/4P1P1/PP1NP2P/1R3RK1 b kq -',Here I'm hoping for the exchange giving my rook some good position to claim back some pawns.

Instead chalking this move up as a blunder for black and recommending the exchange following by black castling *QUEENSIDE*. Well that sure would have thrown a wrench into my plan. Instead this pawn move caused me enough grief I elected to force it myself.

I'm down more material I think black was a bit surprised but handled it well. I'm hoping to jump into the outpost on f6 and try to cause a scene maybe fork something claim the open d file with the rook now on b1. Who knows.

In post-hoc computer analysis this is almost the furthest I am behind in the entire game clocked at -2.62. In a few moves in has me at -2.88 but I actually disagree on that one.

Not sure this is much worse than the other one because at this point I start to see myself stacking the rooks on the f file in the near future (f3 and f1).
426,13,22,2f5,b'7r/ppr1k2p/2p3p1/2Nnpp2/2p5/4PRP1/PP2P2P/3R2K1 w - f6',Saw this coming a minor inconvenience. My pawns are in place for this.

We'll call it future preventative defense against a position I hadn't thought of yet. Not sure if Black saw it then or simply didn't want my knight to go back there for the time being.
428,13,24,2Rdf1,b'7r/p1r1k2p/1pp3p1/3np3/2p1N3/5RP1/PP2P2P/5RK1 b - -',Alright stack is complete and I'm actually feeling a bit better about the position. I've worked my post-hoc computer score back to -1.46 by now.

My next planned move (which I still do anyway) is f7 and now I start to think I may not be able to get the kind of damage I need done to happen. I spent a long time on the next two moves where almost nothing happens. Spend some time going through all of the possible exchanges with f7...

431,13,27,2Ke8,b'4k2r/p2r1R1p/1pp3p1/3np3/2p1N3/6P1/PP2P2P/5RK1 w - -',Nope. Okay so many possible exchanges. d7 for example just doesn't work out well. I could even throw in knight to f6+ King can then take the rook without the stacking. All sorts of trouble bad positions. Just so much that wasn't good here. And remember that move earler where now Black is covering c5 with a pawn? Well that prevents mobility that may have made a series of checks profitable for me. So that leaves us to...
432,13,28,2Rf7f3,b'4k2r/p2r3p/1pp3p1/3np3/2p1N3/5RP1/PP2P2P/5RK1 b - -',This is very similar to the position before and at this point I'm hoping signal_11 is a bit distracted and gets comfortable with the lead. My hope here is that f6 *now* looks good since my rook is out of the way. With a bit of luck maybe I can get some traction here...
433,13,29,2h6,b'4k2r/p2r4/1pp3pp/3np3/2p1N3/5RP1/PP2P2P/5RK1 w - -',I think this move was not in Black's best interest handing me some initiative. Post hoc computer analysis doesn't have it as a blunder but I'm guessing he is hoping to play rook h8-h7 perhaps. I'm curious what his plan was here. Point is no change for me let's see what happens when I push the knight up...
434,13,30,2Nf6+,b'4k2r/p2r4/1pp2Npp/3np3/2p5/5RP1/PP2P2P/5RK1 b - -',Nice fork here some of this is vengeance against that Black Knight. Really been causing me grief this whole game.
435,13,31,Rd2,b'4k2r/p7/1pp2Rpp/4p3/2p5/6P1/PP1rP2P/5RK1 w - -',I expected that now this would become a pawn cleaning battle and I thought (hoped) I'd have the upper hand with two active rooks but at this moment I realize I even have a chance to get lucky coming up with what is a deceptive apparent pawn cleaning situation... note that right now I have fought back to -0.99.
436,13,32,2Rxc6,b'4k2r/p7/1pR3pp/4p3/2p5/6P1/PP1rP2P/5RK1 b - -',Looks innocent enough I bet he saw it coming too. And that pawn on b2 sure is looking easy to capture for him...
437,13,33,2Rxb2,b'4k2r/p7/1pR3pp/4p3/2p5/6P1/Pr2P2P/5RK1 w - -',Success the bait has been taken. (FYI Computer later suggested Rook h7 followed by various pawn removal and misc trouble).
438,13,34,3Rc8+,b'2R1k2r/p7/1p4pp/4p3/2p5/6P1/Pr2P2P/5RK1 b - -',Ouch almost messaged him apologies on this. Just a crushing hit in such an intense game.
439,13,35,Rxa2,b'7R/p2k4/1p4pp/4p3/2p5/6P1/r3P2P/5RK1 w - -',At this point I stop to be careful I count all the pawns and realize how much trouble I could be in if I screw it up closing it here. I expected him to push the pawn to c3 and it turns out so did the computer later but the advantage was still heavily in White's favor. This just made it a bit more so. After running a few calculations...
440,13,36,3Rf6,b'7R/p2k4/1p3Rpp/4p3/2p5/6P1/r3P2P/6K1 b - -',This looks like its a closed deal at this point. King can walk towards the rook but it can get enough distance by a capture on g6 to be able to do the standard two rook combination close. signal_11 resigned at this point we both thanked each other for the game. I think this was a pretty exciting match with some ups and downs and it would have gone on much longer if it wasn't for that nasty skewer on move 30.

No matter what Black chooses it seems to me that White comes out at least a pawn or two stronger. This is basically due to the fact that Black has two pieces trapped--his LSB and Knight. They will certainly be cleared off soon enough whereas White will only lose his Knight and a pawn or two. Black obviously has many options here but I think the most promising are 17...Nxf4 18.exf4 Bxf3 where the Bishop can get back to defend g7. It seems Black *must* take the Knight since it's threatening to leap to e6. Taking with the e-pawn is tempting but it opens up the long diagonal...

His LSB is still hanging as well of course.

Contemporary theory indicates that this should be ok for Black but there are at least two games won by Judit Polgar in this following line (one against Anand) so at first it doesn't seem like such a bad idea to give it a try in the furious complications that steam from the following piece sacrifice.

It is clear that an knight move will lose the g4 pawn with a tempo so sacrificing the knight has not only positional and tactical reasons but is also the only way here. Theory gives here Bg2 as the best try for White but the game will follow an other setup.

There are several options for Black curiously all involving the only good transit square for his pieces: the d7 point. This position is too much fun to spoil it with my analysis but you all can work it out why Nc6 or moving the queen is not that great for Black. It will give you an idea of the punch packed in White's setup.

But (a) drawing with black is not bad and (b) forced lines must be worked to the end by BOTH players. Sadly this is not the case here. 
616,22,8,1Nd5,b'rn2kb1r/1p3p1p/p4P2/3Npb2/3p4/4B3/PPP2P1P/2KR1B1R b kq -',Players have entered in a line of forced moves.

But white's knight on a8 is remote and might get trapped after moves like Nd7 or Bc5 or in some lines after the simple b5. The bishop on e3 is also a problem. on the other hand Black's king is in the centre and the presence of the white pawn on f6  make it dificult to develop and coordinate the pieces. on a more ""long term"" perspective the nice pawn centre might fall togheter with the f6 pawn leading to a drawish engame. 
White has the plan to head for the draw as soon as possible before Black clears a way for his king. The theme idea is to capture in d4 using the lack of squares of the opponent king for instance: 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 (forced Re8 Nc7 # Rc8 Bh3) 20. Bh3 Bc6 21. Nb6. The problem is now however 21. Bc5 and Black is winning. Since White could not see a way to make this work (although THERE IS ONE!) he decides to try and better his chances by playing an intermediate move that seems to lead to an even more forced and beautiful draw involving as we will see the same idea. 
Now let us torn to the position after the sacrifice to show the missed continuation that would have lead to complete equality. After 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 20. Bh3 Bc6 white has 21. b4! Stopping Bc5. But this is not all. Black can try 21... Bh6 22. Kb1 b5 23. Nb6 Kc7 24. Nd7 Rd8 and it will again a piece! Anyway after 25. Rh4! white collects the pawns on the kingside and is in time to exchange everything on d7 obtaining an endgame with 3 pawns agains bishop that will be easy to draw."

Bc6 White has the chance to take another look at that sacrifice and has also other chances. The only problems arise with the tempo-gaining move Bh3.
619,22,11,1Bf3,b'Nn1k1b1r/1p3p1p/p4P2/4p3/3p4/4Bb1B/PPP2P1P/2KR4 w - -',"Now the plan was to sacrifice the bishop on d4 since bishop takes rook offers at least a draw by repetition: 19. Bd4 Bd1 20. Bd6! Re8 21. Nc7 and Na8 back. Of course White can even try to win after capturing the black knight via a6. The problem is sadly that 19. Bd4 can be met by 19...Bh6!+ and if 20. Kb1 after Bd1 the Black king can escape on the kingside. Hence after Bh6 white faces an endgame an exchange down. Disappointed abandons the line and moves the rook. 
However: with good game sacrificing the exchange might have still offered good chances to draw since the Black king is still awkward. Here is a sample: 19...Bh6+ 20. Be3+ Bd1 21. Bh6 Bf3 22. Bd2! (threatening Ba5) Nc6 23. Be3! (now Bb6) and after the almost obligatory 23...d4 24. c3 b5 25. cd ed white has a nice opportunity to use the f6 pawn to level the chances with 26. Bh6! Ba8 27.

947,33,0,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I go by the old motif that knights move before bishops in the opening as bishops usually take time to find their correct positions whereas knight can pop out easily without much choice of position. 
948,33,1,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5bP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I found this strange. Maybe black wanted to dominate the black center squares but usually exchaning a bishop for a knight like this is not effective in the beginning. If the position was closed it woud make sense but here the bishop should be waiting to pin my knight after an inevitable e4 in the King's Indian Attack. 
949,33,2,e6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/8/5BP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I understand that black wanted to defend d5 but there is no need to worry now. e5 in my opinion was stronger. 
950,33,3,d4,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3P4/5BP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',I divereged from a King's Indian Attack to get into a Catalan type position. I played d4 as it the logical move when black allows me space.
951,33,4,Bb4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2BP1/PPP1PP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I don't see the point of the bishop here - it's not pinning anything and only threatening to take the knight on c3 which would limit my force on e4. But black exchanging another bishop for a knight would be a significant positional mistake as two bishops versus two knights in a relatively open position is deadly. 
952,33,5,Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2b2BP1/PPP1PP1P/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Well black carried through with the plan but as I said I think this is a positional error.

I didn't see that 11.Rb1 e5 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5 Rxe5 14. Rxb7. Instead I thought of countering with 11.c4 with the idea of ...e5 and 12.cxd5 with a really complicated game. But I got blinded by thinking about e5 and forgot that playing c4 only loses a pawn and puts me in a bad position. 
956,33,9,Qxd4,b'r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2Qq1B2/5BP1/P1P1PP1P/R4RK1 w - -',Now black won a pawn and has a better position all because I got blinded by the variations of 11.c4 e5....

Though this blunder makes the game much easier for me the attack following this blunder is what really makes the game interesting.

For a while I was considering the complications after Bxb7 which was interesting. But I concluded that I wanted to get checkmate if possible as I had a decent plan on the kingside with all those pieces more or less hanging out there. Therefore I chose to focus on the kingside and see what black would do about it.

970,33,23,Qxc2,b'r3r1k1/ppp2p2/4p1pB/3P2Q1/3R4/5BP1/2q2PKP/8 w - -',Since black's queen was stuck on the queenside she could not provide the defense that was needed.

Here is a note from Wikipedia as its introduction: White pursues quick and harmonious development will bolster his d4-pawn by c2-c3 then often enforces e2-e4 to obtain attacking chances on the kingside as the Torre Bishop pins the f6-knight. If White plays an early c4 the opening will transpose to a number of more common queen pawn openings such as the Queen's Gambit or one of the various Indian defences. The opening is named after the Mexican grandmaster Carlos Torre Repetto who beat former World Champion Emanuel Lasker with it. The variation was also employed by Savielly Tartakower Boris Spassky and Tigran Petrosian early in his career. Among top-level players it perhaps has been most utilized by Jan Timman Alexey Dreev and Pentala Harikrishna. The Torre Attack is rarely met in modern top-flight play as a ""Go to or Primary"" system and statistics suggest that it is not particularly advantageous for White. Due to its calm nature and relative lack of theory however it is popular at club level giving White chances to seize a middlegame initiative. In recent years it has also been used against Black's kingside fianchetto pawn structure.
