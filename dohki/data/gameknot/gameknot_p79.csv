26,1,8,Kxd6,b'rn5r/pp3Bpp/3k4/8/8/8/P4P1P/RN2K1Nb w Q -',And my king is much more centralized for the endgame. This is a very interesting endgame we both still have a knight undeveloped and it's only move 15. Some people might say it's still the middlegame but I think it's the endgame.

246,11,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Sometimes Jack will start off with the Kings Pawn Opening if he is white.  But this is how he usually opens and it is going to become a QGD.
247,11,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',As a result he brings his N out.  This is the most common response to the QGD and it is a solid move because of development. 
248,11,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But I am also going to start developing and in a very interesting way because this move pins N to the K.  However I looked at the position and now realize that this is certainly not the best move.  Better was actually 3...Bd6 as my DSB remains on a longer diagonal.  Now the master mater told me that the best outpost for your bishop is on the space that covers the most squares in my most recent game against Fred.
249,11,3,cxd5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/1b1P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Despite the fact that this is a QGD he takes the same pawn anyway.

251,11,5,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',After that he continues to develop.
252,11,6,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',But so do I.
253,11,7,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I do not know why he played this.  Better was 6.e4.  That's because this move locks in his DSB so that it's confined.  Now my opponent once told me not to lock in your own pieces like this.  And that's after I responded with something like e3 as opposed to e4.
254,11,8,Ne4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1Pn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Therefore I try to take advantage of him because I feel that he has a weakness.  So in this position I am attempting to exchange and I figured that white had no choice but to play 7.Nxc3.  But as Jack proves that is not the case and white does not have a weakness at the moment.
255,11,9,Qa4+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/Qb1Pn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',"At this point I told Mr. Stockel that I did not expect him to play this and am now in a lot of trouble.  I was essentially worried that I would either lose castling rights or a piece.  But as always Jack said ""Start thinking"".  It was then that I realized that the position is not that bad for black and I can easily get out of this with 7...Nc6.  In fact that's the only option because any other move would result in the same consequence as what I just mentioned."
256,11,10,Qb3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/1b1Pn3/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I do not know why he moved here.

What I did not realize is that this move is actually a mistake because it now allows him to win a free pawn if 9.dxc5.  Lucky for me however he missed the opportunity.  On the other hand that's not much of a surprise because he misses these opportunities from time to time.
258,11,12,Bb5,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2n5/1B1p4/1b1Pn3/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',At this point he decides to pin my N.  Although this isn't an intention I will get out of this on my next move.

At first Mr. Stockel told me that this was a mistake when he said ""I don't like it.""  Then Jack changed his made by saying ""Not bad it's ok.  Go ahead and play it.""  "
260,11,14,1Bxc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2B5/3p4/1b1Pn3/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',After this he decides to start an exchange variation by taking my N.
261,11,15,1Bxc3+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2B5/3p4/3Pn3/1Qb1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',But I retake by placing him in check.  After this move we are going to exchange pawns.
262,11,16,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/p1p1qppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn3/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',! Then he decides to castle this time.  I understand that perfectly well and feel that he made the right choice.  Like me white is also getting his K to safety before it's too late.
263,11,17,1Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1qppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn3/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',At this point I want to take white's c3 pawn but his Q is preventing me from doing so.  On that ground I decide to attack his Q at once.  
264,11,18,Nxc3,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1qppp/2p5/3p4/Q2P4/2n1PN2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',After the retreat I finally take advantage of the opportunity to capture his c pawn.  I actually thought that I had won it but generally speaking my coach will not give something away unless he inadvertently overlooks it (which he does sometimes) or if it gives him a winning advantage.  In this case that is not a free pawn because white will retake with 14.Qxc6 so it becomes an even exchange.
265,11,19,Ne2+,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/P3nPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Not only that but by retaking white attacked my N.  So I decide to get out of it by placing him in check.  And after getting out of this I will exchange his DSB for my N.
266,11,20,1Rfxc1,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/P4PPP/R1R4K b - -',I honestly thought that he would retake with 16.Qxc1 but I understand why he played this instead.  Bringing his back to the first rank would undo some of his development so this was the right decision.  Not only that but this move puts pressure on the c file.
267,11,21,1Rb2,b'2b2rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/Pr3PPP/R1R4K w - -',So I respond by putting white in a situation which I thought would be very difficult for him to get out of.  I decide to attack his f pawn and I thought that this move would automatically win it or put Jack under enough pressure for him to make a blunder where he would find himself in trouble..  However that goal is not going to work.
268,11,22,1Kg1,b'2b2rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/Pr3PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',! That's because of his response.  And this is best.  By moving here he is able to defend f2 without any stress so I now have to find a strategy before my position starts to deteriorate.
269,11,23,1Bg4,b'5rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3p4/3P2b1/4PN2/Pr3PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',So I decide to complete development with this move.  That way I can double up my rooks and put pressure on the b file by bringing my f8 R to b8.
270,11,24,1Ne5,b'5rk1/p1p1qppp/2Q5/3pN3/3P2b1/4P3/Pr3PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',Of course white will have none of that when he decides to attack my LSB.
271,11,25,1Qg5,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/2Q5/3pN1q1/3P2b1/4P3/Pr3PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',? But neither am I because his last move will make me extremely brave in this game.  However this move is a mistake that loses a pawn.  Therefore believe it or not 18...f5 was best.  While I don't like putting a whole around my K protecting your material is far more important then King safety.  And that's something which I keep forgetting.  
272,11,26,Qe2,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/8/3Q4/3P4/4P3/Pr2qPPP/R1R3K1 w - -',After he takes I decide to put pressure on the second rank by threatening mate in one.  This time however I realized that he would see the threat so I wouldn't not be able to mate him.  So my goal was to put him in a tough situation where it would be difficult to defend against the threat.  That way he would really have to think about what to do next.  And my plan worked this time because it took him a while to come up with the next move.  Well as it turns out he has several options but this position is certainly not easy for him.
273,11,27,2Qf3,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/8/8/3P4/4PQ2/Pr2qPPP/R1R3K1 b - -',That's because he defends with his Q.  At first I thought that this was his only option but a second look at the position shows that best was actually 21.Rf1 which defends against the threat even better.  The problem with this move is that I will not hesitate to force a Q exchange and that will put a whole around his K.  Now at first I thought that his K will become exposed but that is not the case.  Just because there's a space around the King doesn't mean that it's open or exposed.  I mean that's usually what will happen but certainly not in this game.
274,11,28,Rfb8,b'1r4k1/p1p2ppp/8/8/3P4/4PP2/Pr3P1P/R1R3K1 w - -',? In the meantime I decide to put pressure on the b file as mentioned earlier.  However this move is also a mistake as it loses another pawn.  Not only that but my a7 pawn is left hanging.
275,11,29,a5,b'1r4k1/2R2ppp/8/p7/3P4/4PP2/Pr3P1P/R5K1 w - a6',Therefore I have to protect it.  Until now I did not realize it but 28.R2b7 was just as good and would have done the same thing.  However there's nothing wrong with this choice.  
276,11,30,2Rac1,b'1r4k1/2R2ppp/8/p7/3P4/4PP2/Pr3P1P/2R3K1 b - -',However white now decides to put pressure on the c file by doubling up the rooks.
277,11,31,2g6,b'1r4k1/2R2p1p/6p1/p7/3P4/4PP2/Pr3P1P/2R3K1 w - -',?? Of course I am not bothered by it.  Instead I decide to respond with this move.  The reason being is that I believe that it will eventually win a pawn back especially if Jack plays a sequence of moves like f4 followed by e4 and then something like f5.  And I figured that there was nothing wrong with putting a whole around the K because it appeared to be an endgame.  During an endgame your K becomes a weapon and therefore needs to come out.  However  this is not an endgame.  Not only that but he is not going advance his pawn. Most importantly however this is the losing blunder according to my coach which is why I marked with two question marks.  Therefore Jack told me that better was 24...Kh8 or 24...Kf8 in this position for strategical reasons.  The reason being is that unlike 22.gxf3 this move exposes the K as we will see later on. 
278,11,32,2Rc1c5,b'1r4k1/2R2p1p/6p1/p1R5/3P4/4PP2/Pr3P1P/6K1 b - -',At this point he decides to attack my P.
279,11,33,2Rb2b1+,b'1r4k1/2R2p1p/6p1/p1R5/3P4/4PP2/P4P1P/1r4K1 w - -',But I defend by placing him in check.  However best was actually 25...Rxa2 and that would have won back a pawn.  On the other hand I did not realize it until Saturday the day after our game. 
280,11,34,2Kg2,b'1r4k1/2R2p1p/6p1/p1R5/3P4/4PP2/P4PKP/1r6 b - -',Forced.
281,11,35,2a4,b'1r4k1/2R2p1p/6p1/2R5/p2P4/4PP2/P4PKP/1r6 w - -',But my a5 pawn was still hanging.  In a case like this I also could have brought one of my to b5.  However in my opinion this move was the best choice this time.
282,11,36,2Ra7,b'1r4k1/R4p1p/6p1/2R5/p2P4/4PP2/P4PKP/1r6 b - -',On the other hand he is still determined to win my a pawn.
283,11,37,2Rb1b4,b'1r4k1/R4p1p/6p1/2R5/pr1P4/4PP2/P4PKP/8 w - -',But I am not going to allow that.  So unlike before my only choice is to defend it with one of my rooks.
284,11,38,2d5,b'1r4k1/R4p1p/6p1/2RP4/pr6/4PP2/P4PKP/8 b - -',"At this point he is determined to promote but I am not afraid.  That's because I am now pretty confident that the game is now lost for black and this was before Jack revealed the decisive mistake.  However being in a losing position makes me braver and willing to take more chances before I resign.  The reason being is that sometimes you can pull a swindle and turn a loss into a win as ionadowman pointed out in one of my earlier annotations.  On the other hand getting worried can only exacerbate a bad situation.  So I am not willing to give up until I know that a game is lost because Mr. Stockel always says ""Don't give up right away."""
285,11,39,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/R4p1p/6p1/2RP4/pr6/4PP2/P4PKP/8 w - -',So I decide to continue fighting by putting pressure on the d file.
286,11,40,2e4,b'3r2k1/R4p1p/6p1/2RP4/pr2P3/5P2/P4PKP/8 b - -',However he decides to end that pressure by connecting his pawns.  And now it is an endgame during which connected pawns will strongly benefit your position.  
287,11,41,2Rd4,b'3r2k1/R4p1p/6p1/2RP4/p2rP3/5P2/P4PKP/8 w - -',So I attempt to reapply the pressure with this move.  Of course that attempt is not going work.
288,11,42,3Rca5,b'3r2k1/R4p1p/6p1/R2P4/p2rP3/5P2/P4PKP/8 b - -',That's because of his decision to double up his Rooks.
289,11,43,3Kg7,b'3r4/R4pkp/6p1/R2P4/p2rP3/5P2/P4PKP/8 w - -',Since it is an endgame however I decide to bring my K out in order to use it as a weapon.
290,11,44,3d6,b'3r4/R4pkp/3P2p1/R7/p2rP3/5P2/P4PKP/8 b - -',"This however is how he responds.  At this point I realize that the game is dead lost because white will promote shortly after 32.Ra8.  And there is no way around it because if 32...Rxa8 33.Rxa8.  Then even if I were to take back a pawn with say 33...Rxd6 his pawn majority would outweigh my pawns.  So white will promote with one of his other pawns and there is nothing I can about that.  Therefore I resigned.  After this game I learned an important lesson from Jack Stockel and this lesson is the moral of this story.  It is always important to ""Fight for your position"" in chess and this game is a perfect example.  "

427,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I begin with the usual e4.
428,17,1,e6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
429,17,2,Bd3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here I am anticipating a king side castle by black. So I am positioning my pieces to hit towards the kingside and I expect black to blow up the center at some point. 
430,17,3,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',And now I'm not sure what this game is but black obviously is going to put pressure on the center from the flanks.
431,17,4,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This may be a bit conservative this bishop move. But I don't feel comfortable putting it out further and I think it's too passive on d2.
432,17,5,Nbd2,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I chose this knight move to avoid future doubling of pawns on the c file should that scenario arise which is doubtful actually; it seems nearly certain now that black will castle kingside and that black bishop fianchettoed like it is normally needs to be retained for defense until an opportune time.
433,17,6,d6,b'rnbqk2r/p1p1npbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black has set up a small center but is way too passive here. Fritz says white has a one point advantage here and I tend to agree.
434,17,7,c3,b'rnbqk2r/p1p1npbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/2PBBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This move in I am now ready to begin operations. I'll castle when my opponent does here as there is no threat yet to my king.
435,17,8,h4,b'r1bqk2r/p1pnnpbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP2P/2PBBN2/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq h3',This move is to begin an attack on the kingside. Black chooses to prevent h5 in this position; this actually creates dark-squared weaknesses despite the black bishop.
436,17,9,Ng5,b'r1bqk2r/p1pnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBB3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',and now with my knight in this position black seems passive to me.
437,17,10,Bb7,b'r2qk2r/pbpnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBB3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',A good place for the light squared black bishop.
438,17,11,1Qf3,b'r2qk2r/pbpnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBBQ2/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Thematically the f7 pawn is one of the weaknesses that can often be exploited so I position my queen to do so if the chance presents itself. I am not afraid of f5 at this point but I'll have to watch for tactics down the road. Fritz did not much like this move of mine but white still has an advantage.
439,17,12,1Nf6,b'r2qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBBQ2/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',There is good pressure now on my e4 pawn but it is adequately defended.
440,17,13,1Nc4,b'r2qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Here I am trying to entice black to settle the central pawn question. But he does not advance them.
441,17,14,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Now because of the b7 bishop the game is fairly even. There is no easy way for me to get rid of it without help. At this point of the game black can advance the d pawn and open the center up; that would be good for black right now.
442,17,15,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/5nNp/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now here black has made an interesting move because my pawn is pinned; but white's defenses are sufficient. Bf4 is possible here as a response; the pawn on the h file is immune because if Nxh4 Qg3 wins that knight. However I decide to advance the g pawn anyways.
443,17,16,1g3,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/5nNp/2NPP2P/2PBBQP1/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - -',Fritz thinks this is not a good move that I should have tried to save the bishop... ::edit:: Here were my thoughts during the game with observations: Eduard's comment  below is exactly correct. This is why Fritz did not like this move. However I actually wanted black to take my bishop in this position as he does on his next turn; and in this position I did not wish to advance my center pawns first nor did I wish to start activity on the queenside in case black found counterplay with his other dark-squared bishop. I also did not wish to place my dark squared bishop on the f file because even though that was what Fritz would have done I was not simply content to stymie black in the center; I wanted to create a threat that black would not be able to ignore and did not see at this point a good reason for my bishop to be there. For these reasons although I knew it weakened the king defense I chose to play it anyways Fritz be darned. ;) But in a classical non-blitz game playing this g pawn move is as Eduard alludes extremely dangerous than in a blitz game as it might take too much thinking to figure out how to exploit it without time trouble.
444,17,17,1Nxe3,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBnQP1/PP3P2/R4RK1 w - -',While normally two bishops are worth more only if the side with two bishops creates an open board! This is actually to my liking here; it allows me to create a half open file for my heavy pieces.
445,17,18,1fxe3,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 b - -',At this point perhaps black actually has the better game despite white's dominating position in the center. But after black's next move the game is pretty much over.
446,17,19,1b5,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/3ppnp1/1p4Np/2NPP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 w - -',And this is a mistake in this game. The bishop on b7 is a key piece for black and now I can get rid of it.
447,17,20,1Na5,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/3ppnp1/Np4Np/3PP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 b - -',White will now probably win the end game at the least gaining a pawn up here.
448,17,21,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pbp2pb1/3ppnp1/Np4Np/3PP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 w - -',But this continuation loses the game for black. Necessary was protecting the bishop with the queen preventing tactics along the a8-h1 diagonal.
449,17,22,Rxb7,b'3q1rk1/prp2pb1/3ppnp1/1p4Np/3PP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 w - -',This loses to e5. The game goes on another few moves.
450,17,23,1e5,b'3q1rk1/prp2pb1/3ppnp1/1p2P1Np/3P3P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 b - -',Black will lose major material or be mated.
451,17,24,1Nd5,b'3q1rk1/prp2pb1/3pp1p1/1p1nP1Np/3P3P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 w - -',c6 was better. It's not hard to spot how to win here.
452,17,25,1Nxf7,b'3q1rk1/prp2Nb1/3pp1p1/1p1nP2p/3P3P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 b - -',There is no good response now for black.

456,18,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',He always starts with this and I think that unless you plan to play some gambit it's not very good.

461,18,5,Bxd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1b2B1/8/P1P5/2P2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',Now black's bishop is extremely powerful surveying territory in all directions.

510,20,3,1Nc3,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2P5/2NBPN2/PP1K2PP/R6R b - -',Both sides race to get their pieces out.
511,20,4,1Rhg1,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/8/3NP3/2P1b3/3NP3/PP1K2PP/R5R1 b - -',I'd say black might have a thin edge as his rook is slashing down the d file very nicely.
512,20,5,1Bxd5,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/8/3bP3/2P5/3NP3/PP1K2PP/R5R1 w - -',! Wins a pawn.

518,20,11,Ng4,b'2kr4/p1p2ppp/8/1p6/3rP1n1/1PRNR1P1/P2K3P/8 w - -',? Better much better would have been b4! It would have forced my rook to move.
519,20,12,2Rxf7,b'2kr4/p1p2Rpp/8/1p6/4r1n1/1PRN2P1/P2K3P/8 b - -',As it is white is let slightly off the hook. But black still has a big edge.
520,20,13,2Red4,b'2kr4/p1p2Rpp/8/1p6/3r2n1/1PRN2P1/P2K3P/8 w - -',?? This is the move that threw it all away for black.

524,20,17,3Rbc7+,b'2kr4/R1R3pp/8/1p6/3r2n1/1P1N2P1/P2K3P/8 b - -',And I declared a draw. I felt it was a nice game it was a good draw when I was behind.

A good idea when you have material advantage is to trade pieces to simplifly this Bishop trade was possible thanks to the check otherwise would follow a dangerous check with Qxh7.

627,24,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My first game with Freddy
628,24,1,a5,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq a6',I reviewed black's past games and noticed a recent loss with this opening move when his opponent ignored the rook pawn all the way to axb2 followed by bishop capture. I didn't understand much of the game and not sure if the pawn loss was pivotal but maybe I can do the same thing. I think he's trying to provoke me into something I'll regret. (post game note: plenty of that later)
629,24,2,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p7/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Wait.... what if he doesn't capture b2 and just sits there? Hold on that was a recent game he probably won't do that again. Why didn't I move c4 again?
630,24,3,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p7/P1N2N2/1PPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',so I push c3 no apparent resolve to stick to my plan. After I click move this looks really ugly.
631,24,4,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppppppp/2n5/8/p7/P1N2NP1/1PPPPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',post game note: analysis shows this as an inaccuracy but I intended on the fianchetto and wanted to castle as soon as possible. Not sure why its an inaccuracy.
632,24,5,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/2np4/4p3/p3P3/P1N2NP1/1PPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I don't really know the name of this board configuration but have seen it a lot. Seems like the d6 blocks in his black bishop. So maybe he's going to fianchetto his bishop.
633,24,6,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/p3P3/P1N2NP1/1PPP1P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Since his pawn is on c4 I can hold this pin for a while to make him uncomfortable.
634,24,7,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/2np4/1B2p3/p3P3/P1N2NP1/1PPP1P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Why not g6 and then Bg7? Seems like this blocks in the queen but I think he's castling short.
635,24,8,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/2np4/1B2p3/p2PP3/P1N2NP1/1PP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',I thought about Nxa4 but thought he would advance on d file. I also didn't want to give up the pinned knight position yet.
636,24,9,Nxc6,b'r2qk1nr/1ppbbppp/2Np4/1B6/p3P3/P1N3P1/1PP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I see an opportunity to get his pawns doubled seems like maybe that will be an advantage. I need every one I can get. Also I read somewhere that a fianchetto is easy to defeat when the opponent has the queen and bishop with the same color as your fianchetto bishop. I think if I take his bishop with mine I may be able to defend better. Maybe another advantage. 
637,24,10,1Bxc6+,b'r2qk1nr/1pp1bppp/2Bp4/8/p3P3/P1N3P1/1PP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',(post game note: I think giving up my white bishop was a big mistake)

747,27,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now in the Sicilian I like to take things out of book simply because the Sicilian IS so good for black.
748,27,1,Be2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',SO I often do this quiet move intending to rid myself of this light-squared bishop as soon as I'm able due to how I position my pawn structure. This gives black a chance to wrest the initiative from white but changes how he intends to play. If instead he stays with the main themes of the Sicilian he often ends up having trouble deciding how to proceed in the midgame.
749,27,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Upon moving d3 my opponent correctly fianchettoes anticipating c3 or c4 by white soon. I delay that because I don't want to make that move too early encouraging black to crash his pawns down on the queenside or get in f5 before I get in f4 which makes for a very open and challenging contest.
750,27,3,Kh1,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1R1K b kq -',Prophylactic. As it turned out a wasted tempo. But at this point no harm done.
751,27,4,Ng1,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RNK b - -',This to a player who recognizes a little deviation from the Sicilian is needed is really too slow by white.
752,27,5,f4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/4PP2/3P4/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RNK b - f3',When I play my pawns in this position I've found that black allowing me to get in f4 is never a good thing for black.
753,27,6,Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/3P4/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RNK w - -',Here black probably should have chosen a continuation involving ...Nd4 and ...b5.

755,27,8,1a3,b'r1q2rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/P2P1N2/1P2B1PP/RNBQ1R1K b - -',And it allows me to put my queen on a better square than d2.

I've played this position out on Fritz and Fritz actually likes 21. Nf6+ more than 21. Bh6 but both moves win for white. Black made only a couple mistakes here along with ideas that just needed to be better supported. Had black perhaps prepared his idea a bit more thoroughly or perhaps tried another more aggressive plan with his pawns I'm sure the game would have been a much greater struggle.

806,30,11,2Nc3,b'1r1r2k1/5pp1/n7/q1p2Q2/8/2N3P1/pP1NPPKP/R4R2 b - -',black accidentally drops a piece. 
807,30,12,Nb4,b'1r4k1/5pp1/1q6/2p2Q2/1n6/2N3P1/RP1rPPKP/R7 w - -',if this game were continued from this point by two very high rated players e.g. 2400 it would definitely be a win for white. but at 1600 level 2 pawns wont make much difference one mistake can easily change the game.
808,30,13,2f3,b'Rr4k1/1q3pp1/8/2p2Q2/1n6/2N2PP1/1P1rP1KP/R7 b - -',f3 is a game-changing mistake instead Qe4 would have blocked the check and defended the rook on a8.
809,30,14,Rxe2,b'q5k1/5pp1/8/8/8/2Q2PPK/1P2r2P/8 w - -',this game is now certainly going blacks way.
810,30,15,Qe6,b'8/5ppk/4q3/8/1P4Q1/5PPK/4r2P/8 w - -',at this point white resigns. apart from a few blunders it was well played by both players.
811,31,0,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',The Polish attack! Or perhaps Sokolsky opening. Well I wasn't expecting this in this Blitz game. But there was no way I wanted that dark squared bishop looking at my kingside. After a very brief think I decide to accept doubled pawns if white chooses to do that...
812,31,1,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/1P2P3/8/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq e3',Supposedly the game is equal here although black has a very slight advantage according to Fritz.
813,31,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1P2P3/8/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',And now I may end up with a knight on g7! Now obviously a better way to have approached this odd flank opening would have been with 1. ...e5 but aside from white getting good pressure in the center stay tuned for what follows...
814,31,3,Ne8,b'rnbqnrk1/ppppppbp/6p1/4P3/1PB5/8/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQ -',My pieces are in danger of getting rather cramped.
815,31,4,a6,b'rnbqnrk1/1pppppbp/p5p1/4P3/1PB5/5N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',An immediate ...d5 was better. 
816,31,5,a4,b'rnbqnrk1/1pppppbp/p5p1/4P3/PPB5/5N2/1BPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ a3',Here I decide to create a little queenside action simply to not allow white to totally restrict black.
817,31,6,Na7,b'2bqnrk1/npppppbp/6p1/1P2P3/2B5/5N2/2PP1PPP/BN1QK2R w K -',I did not like Na5.  Perhaps Nb8 would have been better.
818,31,7,c6,b'2bqnrk1/n2pppbp/1pp3p1/1P2P3/2B5/N4N2/2PP1PPP/B2Q1RK1 w - -',Bb7 might have been a better move here. But because of the position if white takes the c pawn I plan on driving up the board a bit on the queenside. And if not then I had ideas to free up my knight and light-squared bishop. Now yes black looks really bad lol. But white's pieces are not that well coordinated yet and I can't afford to let them get coordinated!
819,31,8,dxc6,b'2bqnrk1/n3ppbp/1pp3p1/4P3/2B5/N4N2/2PP1PPP/B2Q1RK1 w - -',I am beginning to feel a little better about black's position now.
820,31,9,1Re1,b'2bqnrk1/n3ppbp/1pp3p1/4P3/2B5/N4N2/2PP1PPP/B2QR1K1 b - -',This was a slight inaccuracy by white. Better was Qe2.
821,31,10,Be6,b'3qnrk1/n3ppbp/2p1b1p1/4P3/1pN5/1B3N2/2PP1PPP/B2QR1K1 w - -',And this gives white back the advantage but I wanted my bishop out doing something.
822,31,11,1Qe2,b'3qnrk1/n3ppbp/2p1b1p1/4P3/1pN5/1B3N2/2PPQPPP/B3R1K1 b - -',Better for white was Bd4 or Nd4. But his momentary failure to see this allowed me to cover it on my next move.
823,31,12,1h3,b'3qnrk1/4ppbp/2p1b1p1/1n2P3/1pN5/1B3N1P/2PPQPP1/B3R1K1 b - -',I think this was an inaccuracy here. It gives me one more tempo to reposition a knight to a very useful place and with my kingside fianchettoed there would be no lasting pin on g4. Fritz agrees.
824,31,13,Nd5,b'3q1rk1/4ppbp/2p1b1p1/1n1nP3/1pNP4/1B3N1P/2P1QPP1/B3R1K1 w - -',Now at this point of the game both sides look rather awkward. Fritz insists the game is still even. No one has yet blundered but a couple of small inaccuracies have been made leading to white's dark squared bishop being rather out of the action and black to being still cramped although not as badly as before.
825,31,14,2Ng5,b'3q1rk1/4ppbp/2p1b1p1/1n1nP1N1/1pNP4/1B5P/2P1QPP1/B3R1K1 b - -',I give this some thought and decide I would not mind so much if the pawns were doubled as it would give me the f file. I don't want the white e pawn advancing any further especially with the way white's pieces are set up. Fritz does not like this idea preferring that I not allow those pawns to be doubled.
826,31,15,2Bh6,b'3q1rk1/4pp1p/2p1b1pb/1n1nP1N1/1pNP4/1B5P/2P1QPP1/B3R1K1 w - -',So I decide to see what white really does have in mind since my black bishop was not doing very much on g7.
827,31,16,2g3,b'3q1rk1/4p2p/2p1p1pb/1n1nP3/1pNP4/1B4PP/2P1QP2/B3R1K1 b - -',I am not wanting to control the f4 square but white felt he needed to make sure he did. Fritz thinks Qg4 was much better and this is the first move Fritz really dislikes. Nor do I do what Fritz wishes; I don't want to move a knight to c3 because it allows white to find an immediate use for his one bad bishop. But after 22. ...Ndc3 23. Bxc3 bxc3 black gains dangerous piece pressure on the queenside. One line would continue 24. Rd1 Nxd4 25. Qd3 c5 26. Ne3 Kg7 and little is left for white to try; 27. f4 is too dangerous. In this blitz game however I did not see this.
828,31,17,2Rf7,b'3q2k1/4pr1p/2p1p1pb/1n1nP3/1pNP4/1B4PP/2P1QP2/B3R1K1 w - -',Here I am preparing a bit of a push on the f file. For some reason white's dark squared bishop has seemingly been forgotten in that upper corner and I am not minding that one bit. It's a pretty bad bishop right now and would take a couple moves to undo that. But white does not see the long term value of doing so at this point.
829,31,18,2Qg4,b'3q2k1/4pr1p/2p1p1pb/1n1nP3/1pNP2Q1/1B4PP/2P2P2/B3R1K1 b - -',This is actually a pretty good move for white if he chooses the right continuations later. Fortunately for me he does not. I'll mention it in a bit.
830,31,19,2Rf5,b'3q2k1/4p2p/2p1p1pb/1n1nPr2/1pNP2Q1/1B4PP/2P2P2/B3R1K1 w - -',I will have time now to swing my queen over and create a little pressure down the f file. This game is just really odd at this point.
831,31,20,2h4,b'3q2k1/4p2p/2p1p1pb/1n1nPr2/1pNP2QP/1B4P1/2P2P2/B3R1K1 b - -',I believe that white is simply creating a place for his queen to go so that g pawn can move forward. The white king will be exposed but I am still a ways from being able to take advantage of that.
832,31,21,2f4,b'5qk1/4p2p/2p1p1pb/1n1nPr2/1pNP1PQP/1B4P1/2P5/B3R1K1 b - f3',And white thinks he has shut down my attack. Well... we'll see here in a bit. I have an idea but don't know if I have time to do it. And white can easily force my rook from f5...
833,31,22,2Qf7,b'6k1/4pq1p/2p1p1pb/1n1nPr2/1pNP1PQP/1B4P1/2P5/B3R1K1 w - -',I'd like to get my king to g7 at some point but perhaps not quite yet. Now I'm committed to my idea; the black rook cannot escape easily... and if this wasn't Blitz I'm pretty sure white would find the way to win a pawn...
834,31,23,2Ne3,b'6k1/4pq1p/2p1p1pb/1n1nPr2/1p1P1PQP/1B2N1P1/2P5/B3R1K1 b - -',I of course am forced to exchange knights because I don't want to move my rook in this position. For some reason white does not continue with the obvious to threaten the black rook here.
835,31,24,Nc7,b'6k1/2n1pq1p/2p1p1pb/4Pr2/1p1P1PQP/1B2R1P1/2P5/B5K1 w - -',Well this could get rather ugly for black since black's rook is rather trapped at the moment.
836,31,25,2Bc4,b'6k1/2n1pq1p/2p1p1pb/4Pr2/1pBP1PQP/4R1P1/2P5/B5K1 b - -',Hmmm. I had not considered just that bishop move as obvious as it is. With Bd3 on his next move black would have to play what he had prepared before he was ready. I try one move first to see white's intention. Can you guess black's intention yet?
837,31,26,2Nd5,b'6k1/4pq1p/2p1p1pb/3nPr2/1pBP1PQP/4R1P1/2P5/B5K1 w - -',Rf3 here for white is dangerous for black. If Rf3 black will be hard pressed to salvage a draw. But white misses it having decided he wants his rook to take the b pawn. So at this point the game takes a different turn than it otherwise would have.
838,31,27,cxd5,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1pb/3pPr2/1p1P1PQP/4R1P1/2P5/B5K1 w - -',I did not take with the e pawn because I did not want that diagonal open for the white queen nor did I wish to have an unsupported backwards pawn. Nor did I want white to get in e6. And because white chose to give up that powerful white bishop I can try my idea on my terms now if white does not move Rf3.
839,31,28,3Rb3,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1pb/3pPr2/1p1P1PQP/1R4P1/2P5/B5K1 b - -',What would you do here as black? It's likely easy to see now since there is not much else black can do here and I've given plenty of hints on what white needed to do. You stronger players will know anyways. It turns out to give black an advantage now that the white light-squared bishop is no longer on the board.
840,31,29,3Bxf4,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1p1/3pPr2/1p1P1bQP/1R4P1/2P5/B5K1 w - -',Bxf4! So white thinks a bit here. And decides to take it on.
841,31,30,3Qg3,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1p1/3pP3/1p1P1r1P/1R4Q1/2P5/B5K1 b - -',To keep the game from getting away from white Qh3 was called for here. This is the game's first real blunder and it gives black such an advantage that even in Blitz it's not given back. After Qh3 however black's winning chances are greatly reduced even though black still has good opportunities to draw with best moves according to Fritz.
842,31,31,3Rf1+,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1p1/3pP3/1p1P3P/1R4Q1/2P5/B4rK1 w - -',I missed Qf5! which would have been even better here. Well to be honest I thought about it. But time was short and I did not have time to think it all the way through; seeing that nothing was imminently going to threaten the black king I decided to take the bishop.
843,31,32,Rxa1,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1p1/3pP3/1p1P3P/1R4Q1/2P4K/r7 w - -',Qf5 was still even more devastating here but this time I did not even consider it.
844,31,33,3Rxb4,b'6k1/4pq1p/4p1p1/3pP3/1R1P3P/6Q1/2P4K/r7 b - -',And this move seals white's fate; he does not have time to grab the pawn.
845,31,34,3Qf1,b'6k1/4p2p/4p1p1/3pP3/1R1P3P/6Q1/2P4K/r4q2 w - -',Either Qf5 or Qf1 as I chose are both now devastating and the game will end soon.
846,31,35,3Rb8+,b'1R4k1/4p2p/4p1p1/3pP3/3P3P/6Q1/2P4K/r4q2 b - -',This just delays the inevitable. White has no good response.
847,31,36,3Qg2,b'1R6/4p1kp/4p1p1/3pP3/3P3P/8/2P3QK/r4q2 b - -',Forced because otherwise Qh1 is mate.
848,31,37,3Qg3,b'1R6/4p1kp/4p1p1/3pP3/3P1q1P/6Q1/2P4K/r7 b - -',Kh3 also leads to a won endgame for black. This loses immediately...
849,31,38,3Rh1+,b'1R6/4p1kp/4p1p1/3pP3/3P1q1P/6Q1/2P4K/7r w - -',Rh1!

It follows a big number of games and yet I find the ideas aren't all that clear for black in particular.   So wouldn't mind sharing this game and getting ideas from other players.

I'm hoping for a little clarification here!   Black could just castle here instead and hope to weather the inevitable Bd3 and h4-h5-h6 attack and if he survives freeze the c3 pawn (with a c4 push) and target it.

We're still following 400+ GK games.   White's kingside pawn majority is a lasting advantage.   White has an extra pawn and an open b-file to attack black's king which is invariably going to castle long.   Black has better development and is aiming to keep white's king in the centre.   I'm not entirely sure of the necessity of Nf5 at this stage though even though it's by a distance the most-played move here.   Is it just a case that there's no rush castling so you may as well bring the knight more into things?   Is it that there is a rush to halt the kingside pawns as soon as possible so the knight heads towards them?
1077,35,14,1Rb1,b'r3k1r1/ppqb1p2/2n1p3/3pPn2/5P2/P1Q5/2P1N1PP/1RB1KB1R b Kq -',Taking the open file; why not?

I have nothing to speak of on either flank and white's king can't castle so it has to be where black plays.   I think the aim is to try blow open the centre for the major pieces?

I'll admit to having one eye on the openings database (still following 26 games here) - partly out of curiosity in this line.   I've not played it in OTB chess but it looks like something I'd like to try!   I'm assuming this is black trying to blow open the centre of the board and prize open the juicy king beneath?
